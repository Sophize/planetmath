  "definition": "An *integral domain*, or *domain*, is a commutative cancellation ring\nwith an identity element $1 \\neq 0$.\n\nIntegral domains are sometimes allowed to be noncommutative, but we\nadopt the convention that an integral domain is commutative unless\notherwise specified.\n\nThis notion has essentially nothing to do with the . It is also not very\nclosely related to the notion of integral, which is applied to ring\nelements, or that of integral closure, which is applied to extensions of\nrings, although these concepts are normally applied to integral domains.\nAn integral domain shares some of the properties of the integers (more\nthan other kinds of rings, but by no means all those of interest).\nIntegral domains have fraction fields, which play the role of the\nrational numbers, and they each have a characteristic (which is either a\nprime number or zero).",
