  "statement": "The primary decomposition theorem for ideals in a given commutative ring\n(with 1) is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\nThe full statement of the theorem is as follows:\n\nEvery decomposable ideal in a commutative ring $R$ with 1 has a unique\nminimal primary decomposition. In other words, if $I$ is an ideal of $R$\nwith two minimal primary decompositions\n$$I=J_1\\cap J_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap J_m = K_1 \\cap K_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap K_n,$$\nthen $m=n$, and after some rearrangement,\n$\\operatorname{rad}(J_i)=\\operatorname{rad}(K_i)$.\n\nThe theorem says, that, the number of primary components of a minimal\nprimary decomposition of an ideal, as well as the set of prime radicals\nassociated with the primary components, are unique. This is not to say,\nhowever, that the ideal has a unique minimal primary decomposition. For\nexample, let $k$ be a field. Consider the ring $k[x,y]$ of polynomials\nover $k$ in two variables. The ideal $(x^2,xy)$ has minimal primary\ndecompositions $(x)\\cap (x^2,y+rx)$ for every $r\\in k$.\n\n**Remark**. To tie the fundamental theorem of arithmetic with this\ntheorem, we observe that every natural number $n$ greater than $1$ can\nbe uniquely expressed as a product of prime powers:\n$$n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_n^{a_n},$$ where each $p_i$ is a prime\nnumber. This is the same as saying that\n$$(n)=(p_1^{a_1}) \\cap (p_2^{a_2}) \\cap  \\cdots \\cap (p_n^{a_n}),$$ as\nevery $(p^a)$ is a $(p)$-primary ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}$ for every prime\n$p\\in \\mathbb{N}$. The decomposition is minimal, as\n$(p_1^{a_1})=(p_2^{a_2})$ iff $p_1=p_2$ and $a_1=a_2$.\n\n[9]{} D.G. Northcott, *Ideal Theory*, Cambridge University Press, 1953.",
