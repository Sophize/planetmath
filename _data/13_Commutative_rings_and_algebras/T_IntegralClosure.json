  "definition": "Let $B$ be a ring with a subring $A$. The [*integral closure*]{} of $A$\nin $B$ is the set $A' \\subset B$ consisting of all elements of $B$ which\nare integral over $A$.\n\nIt is a theorem that the integral closure of $A$ in $B$ is itself a\nring. In the special case where $A = \\mathbb{Z}$, the integral closure\n$A'$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is often called the [*ring of integers*]{} in $B$.",
