  "definition": "Let $f: A \\to B$ be a ring map. We can look at the ideal generated by\nthe image of $\\mathfrak{a}$, which is called an [*extended ideal*]{} and\nis denoted by $\\mathfrak{a}^e$.\\\n\\\nIt is not true in general that if $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal in $A$, the\nimage of $\\mathfrak{a}$ under $f$ will be an ideal in $B$. (For example,\nconsider the embedding $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$. The image of the\nideal $(2) \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ is [*not*]{} an ideal in $\\mathbb{Q}$,\nsince the only ideals in $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\{0\\}$ and all of\n$\\mathbb{Q}$.)",
