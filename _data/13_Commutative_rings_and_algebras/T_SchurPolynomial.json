  "definition": "A *Schur polynomial* is a special symmetric polynomial associated to a\npartition of an integer, or equivalently to a Young diagram. Schur\npolynomials also have a power series generalization, the *Schur\nfunctions*.\n\nFirst we define some notation. Let $\\lambda$ be a partition of $n$, and\nlet $T$ be a filling of the Young diagram for $\\lambda$. Then by $x^T$\nwe mean the monomial $$x^T = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i^{c_i(T)},$$ where\n$c_i(T)$ is the number of times the number $i$ appears in the filling\n$T$. Since $T$ only has finitely many boxes, the product is finite. For\nexample, let $\\lambda = (3,3,2,2)$, and let $T$ be the filling\n\n[=1 =4 =2 =4 =3 =4 =1 =3 =2 =3 =3 =3 =1 =2 =2 =2 =1 =1 =2 =1 ]{}\n\nNotice that $1$ and $2$ each appear three times in the filling, while\n$3$, $4$, and $5$ each appear only once. Thus $x^T = x_1^3 x_2^3 x_3\nx_4 x_5$.\n\nFor convenience let us use $\\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda, n)$ to denote\nthe collection of fillings of semi-standard tableaux with shape\n$\\lambda$ by positive integers from $1$ to $n$. Then we can define the\n*Schur polynomial* $s_{\\lambda}(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ to be the polynomial\n$$s_{\\lambda}(x_1,\\dots,x_n) = \\sum_{T\\in\\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda, n)} x^T.$$\n\nFor example, take $n=5$ and consider the partition $\\lambda = (1, 1,\n1)$ of $3$. Then the Schur polynomial $s_{\\lambda}(x_1,\\dots, x_5)$ is\n$$s_{(1,1,1)}(x_1,\\dots,x_5) = \\sum_{1\\le i < j < k\\le 5} x_i x_j x_k.$$\nNote that this is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree 3 in the\nvariables $x_1,\\dots,x_5$. In fact, $s_{(1^k)}(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ is always\nthe elementary symmetric polynomial of degree $k$ in the variables\n$x_1,\\dots,x_n$. The polynomial $s_{(k)}(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ is the complete\nsymmetric polynomial of degree $k$ in $x_1,\\dots,x_n$.\n\nTo define Schur functions, we consider the set\n$\\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda)$ of all fillings of semi-standard tableaux\nwith shape $\\lambda$:\n$$\\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda) := \\bigcup_{n\\ge 1} \\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda, n).$$\nThe *Schur function* associated to the partition $\\lambda$ is\n$$s_{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{x\\in\\operatorname{sst}(\\lambda)} x^T$$\nThus the Schur functions are power series in infinitely many variables.\nFor example,\n$$s_{(1,1,1)}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{1\\le i < j < k} x_i x_j x_k = x_1 x_2 x_3 + \\dots + x_{14} x_{42} x_{132} + \\dots.$$\nAll Schur polynomials and Schur functions are symmetric functions. In\nfact, the Schur polynomials of degree $n$ form a basis for the vector\nspace of symmetric polynomials of degree $n$.\n\n[99]{} William\u00a0Fulton. *Young tableaux: with applications to\nrepresentation theory and geometry*.
