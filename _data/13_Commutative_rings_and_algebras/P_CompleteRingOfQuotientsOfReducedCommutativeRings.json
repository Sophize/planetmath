  "statement": "There is a characterization of complete ring of quotients of reduced\ncommutative rings. Let $A$ be a commutative ring, then if $B$ is an\noverring of $A$ and if for any element $b\\in B\\backslash\\{0\\}$ there is\nan $a\\in A$ such that $ab\\in A\\backslash\\{0\\}$, then $B$ is said to be a\n*rational extension* of $A$. See how similar this is with the definition\nof essential extension in the category of rings, obviously all rational\nextensions of reduced commutative rings are also essential extensions.\nFurthermore there is a maximum (upto $A$-isomorphism) rational extension\nof $A$ and this is in fact the complete ring of quotients of $A$.",
