  "definition": "Throughout this entry, let $D$ be a commutative ring with $1\\neq 0$.\n\nA gcd (greatest common divisor) of two elements $a, b \\in D$, is an\nelement $d \\in D$ such that:\n\n1.  $d\\mid a$ and $d\\mid b$,\n\n2.  if $c\\in D$ with $c\\mid a$ and $c\\mid b$, then $c\\mid d$.\n\nFor example, $0$ is a gcd of $0$ and $0$ in any $D$. In fact, if $d$ is\na gcd of $0$ and $0$, then $d \\mid 0$. But $0\\mid 0$, so that\n$0 \\mid d$, which means that, for some $x\\in D$, $d=0x=0$. As a result,\n$0$ is the unique gcd of $0$ and $0$.\n\nIn general, however, a gcd of two elements is not unique. For example,\nin the ring of integers, $1$ and $-1$ are both gcd\u2019s of two relatively\nprime elements. By definition, any two gcd\u2019s of a pair of elements in\n$D$ are associates of each other. Since the binary relation \u201cbeing\nassociates\u201d of one anther is an equivalence relation (*not* a congruence\nrelation!), we may define *the* gcd of $a$ and $b$ as the set\n$$\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b):=\\lbrace c\\in D\\mid c\\mbox{ is a gcd of }a\\mbox{ and }b\\rbrace,$$\nFor example, as we have seen,\n$\\operatorname{GCD}(0,0)=\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$. Also, for any $a\\in D$,\n$\\operatorname{GCD}(a,1)=\\operatorname{U}(D)$, the group of units of\n$D$.\n\nIf there is no confusion, let us denote $\\gcd(a,b)$ to be any element of\n$\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b)$.\n\nIf $\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b)$ contains a unit, then $a$ and $b$ are said\nto be *relatively prime*. If $a$ is irreducible, then for any $b\\in D$,\n$a,b$ are either relatively prime, or $a\\mid b$.\n\nAn integral domain $D$ is called a *gcd domain* if any two elements of\n$D$, not both zero, have a gcd. In other words, $D$ is a gcd domain if\nfor any $a,b\\in D$, $\\operatorname{GCD}(a,b)\\ne \\varnothing$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   A unique factorization domain, or UFD is a gcd domain, but the\n    converse is not true.\n\n-   A Bezout domain is always a gcd domain. A gcd domain $D$ is a Bezout\n    domain if $\\gcd(a,b) = ra+sb$ for any $a, b \\in D$ and some\n    $r, s \\in D$.\n\n-   In a gcd domain, an irreducible element is a prime element.\n\n-   A gcd domain is integrally closed. In fact, it is a Schreier domain.\n\n-   Given an integral domain, one can similarly define an lcm of two\n    elements $a,b$: it is an element $c$ such that $a \\mid c$ and\n    $b \\mid c$, and if $d$ is an element such that $a \\mid d$ and\n    $b \\mid d$, then $c \\mid d$. Then, a *lcm domain* is an integral\n    domain such that every pair of elements has a lcm. As it turns out,\n    the two notions are equivalent: an integral domain is lcm iff it is\n    gcd.\n\nThe following diagram indicates how the different domains are related:\n\n  -- ------------------- --------------- ------------------- --------------\n      $\\Longrightarrow$        PID        $\\Longrightarrow$       UFD\n                                                             \n                          $\\Downarrow$                        $\\Downarrow$\n                                                             \n                          Bezout domain   $\\Longrightarrow$    gcd domain\n  -- ------------------- --------------- ------------------- --------------\n\n[7]{} D.
