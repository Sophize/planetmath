  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity element equipped with a\ntopology defined by a decreasing sequence:\n$$\\ldots \\subset {\\mathfrak{A}}_3 \\subset {\\mathfrak{A}}_2 \\subset {\\mathfrak{A}}_1$$\nof ideals such that\n${\\mathfrak{A}}_n\\cdot {\\mathfrak{A}}_m \\subset {\\mathfrak{A}}_{n+m}$.\nWe say that $R$ is a $p$-ring if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.  The residue ring $\\overline{k}=R/{\\mathfrak{A}}_1$ is a perfect ring\n    of characteristic $p$.\n\n2.  The ring $R$ is Hausdorff and complete for its topology.\n\nA $p$-ring $R$ is said to be strict (or a $p$-adic ring) if the topology\nis defined by the $p$-adic filtration ${\\mathfrak{A}}_n=p^nR$, and $p$\nis not a zero-divisor of $R$.\n\nThe prototype of strict $p$-ring is the ring of ${\\mathbb{Z}}_p$ with\nthe usual profinite topology.\n\n[9]{} J.
