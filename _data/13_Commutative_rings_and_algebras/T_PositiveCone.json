  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1. A subset $P$ of $R$ is called a\n*pre-positive cone* of $R$ provided that\n\n1.  $P+P\\subseteq P$ ($P$ is additively closed)\n\n2.  $P\\cdot P\\subseteq P$ ($P$ is multiplicatively closed)\n\n3.  $-1\\notin P$\n\n4.  $\\operatorname{sqr}(R):=\\lbrace r^2\\mid r\\in R\\rbrace \\subseteq P.$\n\nAs it turns out, a field endowed with a pre-positive cone has an order\nstructure. The field is called a , orderable, or ordered field. Before\ndefining what this \u201corder\u201d is, let\u2019s do some preliminary work. Let $P_0$\nbe a pre-positive cone of a field $F$. By Zorn\u2019s Lemma, the set of\npre-positive cones extending $P_0$ has a maximal element $P$. It can be\nshown that $P$ has two additional properties:\n\n1.  $P\\cup (-P)=F$\n\n2.  $P\\cap (-P)=(0).$\n\nFirst, suppose there is $a\\in F-(P\\cup (-P))$. Let $\\overline{P}=P+Pa$.\nThen $a\\in\\overline{P}$ and so $P$ is strictly contained in\n$\\overline{P}$. Clearly, $\\operatorname{sqr}(F)\\subseteq \\overline{P}$\nand $\\overline{P}$ is easily seen to be additively closed. Also,\n$\\overline{P}$ is multiplicatively closed as the equation\n$(p_1+q_1a)(p_2+q_2a)=(p_1p_2+q_1q_2a^2)+(p_1q_2+q_1p_2)a$ demonstrates.\nSince $P$ is a maximal and $\\overline{P}$ properly contains $P$,\n$\\overline{P}$ is not a pre-positive cone, which means\n$-1\\in \\overline{P}$. Write $-1=p+qa$. Then $q(-a)=p+1\\in P$. Since\n$q\\in P$, $1/q=q(1/q)^2\\in P$, $-a=(1/q)(p+1)\\in P$, contradicting the\nassumption that $a\\notin -P$. Therefore, $P\\cup (-P)=F$.\n\nFor the second part, suppose $a\\in P\\cap (-P)$. Since $a\\in -P$,\n$-a\\in P$. If $a\\neq 0$, then $-1=a(-a)(1/a)^2\\in P$, a contradiction.\n\nA subset $P$ of a field $F$ satisfying conditions 1, 2, 5 and 6 is\ncalled a *positive cone* of $F$. A positive cone is a pre-positive cone.\nIf $a\\in F$, then either $a\\in P$ or $-a\\in P$. In either case,\n$a^2\\in P$. Next, if $-1\\in P$, then $1\\in -P$. But $1=1^2\\in P$, we\nhave $1\\in P\\cap (-P)$, contradicting Condition 6 of $P$.\n\nNow, define a binary relation $\\leq$, on $F$ by:\n$$a\\leq b\\Longleftrightarrow b-a\\in P$$ It is not hard to see that\n$\\leq$ is a total order on $F$. In addition, with the additive and\nmultiplicative structures on $F$, we also have the following two rules:\n\n1.  $a\\leq b \\Rightarrow a+c\\leq b+c$\n\n2.  $0\\leq a$ and $0\\leq b\\Rightarrow 0\\leq ab$.\n\nThus, $F$ is a field ordered by $\\leq$.\n\n**Remark**. Positive cones may be defined for more general ordered\nalgebraic structures, such as partially ordered groups, or partially\nordered rings.\n\n[99]{} A.
