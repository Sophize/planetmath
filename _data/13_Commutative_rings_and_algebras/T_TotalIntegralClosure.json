  "definition": "A commutative unitary ring $R$ is said to be *totally integrally closed*\nif it does not have an overring which is both an integral and an\nessential extension of $R$.\n\nAll totally integrally closed rings are .\n\nSuppose that $R$ is any commutative ring and that $\\bar R$ is an\nintegral and essential extension of $R$. If $\\bar R$ is a totally\nintegrally closed ring, then $\\bar R$ is called a *total integral\nclosure* of $R$.\n\nFor fields the concept totally integrally closed, integrally closed and\nalgebraically closed coincide.\n\nLet $A$ be an integral domain, then its total integral closure is the\nintegral closure of $A$ in the algebraic closure of\n${\\mathrm{Quot}(A)}$.\n\nEnochs has first proven that all commutative reduced rings have total\nintegral closure and this is unique up to ring isomorphism.",
