  "statement": "If $K$ is a field, and ${\\left\\lvert \\cdot\\right\\rvert}$ a nontrivial\nnon-archimedean valuation (or absolute value) on $K$, then\n${\\left\\lvert \\cdot\\right\\rvert}$ has some properties that are\ncounterintuitive (and that are false for archimedean valuations).\n\nLet $K$ be a field with a non-archimedean absolute value\n${\\left\\lvert \\cdot\\right\\rvert}$. For $r>0$ a real number, $x\\in K$,\ndefine $$\\begin{gathered}\nB(x,r) = \\{y\\in K\\ \\mid\\ {\\left\\lvert x-y\\right\\rvert}<r\\},\\ \\text{the open ball of radius $r$ at $x$}\\\\\n\\bar{B}(x,r) = \\{y\\in K\\ \\mid\\ {\\left\\lvert x-y\\right\\rvert}\\leq r\\},\\ \\text{the closed ball of radius $r$ at $x$}\\end{gathered}$$\nThen\n\n1.  $B(x,r)$ is both open and closed;\n\n2.  $\\bar{B}(x,r)$ is both open and closed;\n\n3.  If $y\\in B(x,r)$ (resp. $\\bar{B}(x,r)$) then $B(x,r)=B(y,r)$ (resp.\n    $\\bar{B}(x,r)=\\bar{B}(y,r)$);\n\n4.  $B(x,r)$ and $B(y,r)$ (resp. $\\bar{B}(x,r)$ and $\\bar{B}(y,r)$) are\n    either identical or disjoint;\n\n5.  If $B_1 = B(x,r)$ and $B_2 = B(y,s)$ are not disjoint, then either\n    $B_1\\subset B_2$ or $B_2\\subset B_1$;\n\n6.  If $(x_n)$ is a sequence of elements of $K$ with\n    $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n=0$, then $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x_n$ is Cauchy\n    (and thus if $K$ is complete, a sufficient condition for convergence\n    of a series is that the terms tend to zero)\n\n**Proof.** \u00a0We start by proving (3). Suppose $y\\in B(x,r)$. If\n$z\\in B(x,r)$, then since the absolute value is non-archimedean, we have\n$${\\left\\lvert z-y\\right\\rvert} ={\\left\\lvert (z-x)+(x-y)\\right\\rvert} \\leq \\max({\\left\\lvert z-x\\right\\rvert},{\\left\\lvert x-y\\right\\rvert}) < r$$\nso that $z\\in B(y,r)$. Clearly $x\\in B(y,r)$, so reversing the roles of\n$x$ and $y$, we see that $B(x,r) = B(y,r)$. Finally, replacing $B$ by\n$\\bar{B}$ and $<$ by $\\leq$, we get equality of closed balls as well.\n\n\\(4) is now trivial: If $B(x,r)\\cap B(y,r)\\neq\\emptyset$, choose\n$z\\in B(x,r)\\cap B(y,r)$; then by (3), $B(x,r) = B(z,r) = B(y,r)$. An\nidentical argument proves the result for closed balls.\n\nTo prove (5), choose $z\\in B_1\\cap B_2$. Assume first that $r\\leq s$;\nthen $B(z,r) = B_1$, and $B(z,r)\\subset B(z,s) = B_2$, so that\n$B_1\\subset B_2$. If $s\\leq r$, then we have identically that\n$B_2\\subset B_1$. (Note that (4) is a special case when $r=s$).\n\n\\(1) and (2) now follow: for (1), note that $B(x,r)$ is obviously open;\nits complement consists of a union of open balls of radius $r$ disjoint\nwith $B(x,r)$ and its complement is therefore open. Thus $B(x,r)$ is\nclosed. For (2), $\\bar{B}(x,r)$ is obviously closed; to see that it is\nopen, take any $y\\in \\bar{B}(x,r)$; then $\\bar{B}(x,r)=\\bar{B}(y,r)$ and\nthus $B(y,s)\\subset \\bar{B}(y,r)$ for $s<r$ is an open neighborhood of\n$y$ contained in $\\bar{B}(x,r)$, which is therefore open.\n\nFinally, to prove (6), we must show that given $\\epsilon$, we can find\n$N>0$ sufficiently large such that\n${\\left\\lvert \\sum_{i=m}^n x_i\\right\\rvert}<\\epsilon$ whenever $m,n>N$.\nSimply choose $N$ such that ${\\left\\lvert x_i\\right\\rvert}<\\epsilon$ for\n$i>N$; then\n$${\\left\\lvert \\sum_{i=m}^n x_i\\right\\rvert}\\leq \\max({\\left\\lvert x_m\\right\\rvert},\\ldots,{\\left\\lvert x_n\\right\\rvert}) < \\epsilon$$",
