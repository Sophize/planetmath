  "statement": "**Theorem.** The polynomial ring over a field is a Euclidean domain.\\\n[*Proof.*]{} Let $K[X]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$ in the\nindeterminate $X$. Since $K$ is an integral domain and any polynomial\nring over integral domain is an integral domain, the ring $K[X]$ is an\nintegral domain.\n\nThe degree $\\nu(f)$, defined for every $f$ in $K[X]$ except the zero\npolynomial, satisfies the requirements of a Euclidean valuation in\n$K[X]$. In fact, the degrees of polynomials are non-negative integers.\nIf $f$ and $g$ belong to $K[X]$ and the latter of them is not the zero\npolynomial, then, as is well known, the long division $f/g$ gives two\nunique polynomials $q$ and $r$ in $K[X]$ such that $$f \\;=\\; qg+r,$$\nwhere $\\nu(r) < \\nu(g)$ or $r$ is the zero polynomial. The second\nproperty usually required for the Euclidean valuation, is justified by\n$$\\nu(fg) \\;=\\; \\nu(f)+\\nu(g) \\;\\geqq\\; \\nu(f).$$\n\nThe theorem implies, similarly as in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}$ of the\nintegers, that one can perform in $K[X]$ a Euclid\u2019s algorithm which\nyields a greatest common divisor of two polynomials. Performing several\nEuclid\u2019s algorithms one obtains a gcd of many polynomials; such a gcd is\nalways in the same polynomial ring $K[X]$.\\\nLet $d$ be a greatest common divisor of certain polynomials. Then\napparently also $kd$, where $k$ is any non-zero element of $K$, is a gcd\nof the same polynomials. They do not have other gcd\u2019s than $kd$, for if\n$d'$ is an arbitrary gcd of them, then\n$$d' \\mid d \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad d \\mid d',$$ i.e. $d$ and $d'$ are\nassociates in the ring $K[X]$ and thus $d'$ is gotten from $d$ by\nmultiplication by an element of the field $K$. So we can write the\n\n**Corollary 1.** The greatest common divisor of polynomials in the ring\n$K[X]$ is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero element of the field\n$K$. The gcd of polynomials is unique.\\\nIf the monic gcd of two polynomials is 1, they may be called\n[*coprime*]{}.\\\nUsing the Euclid\u2019s algorithm as in $\\mathbb{Z}$, one can prove the\n\n**Corollary 2.** If $f$ and $g$ are two non-zero polynomials in $K[X]$,\nthis ring contains such polynomials $u$ and $v$ that\n$$\\gcd(f,\\,g) \\;=\\; uf+vg$$ and especially, if $f$ and $g$ are coprime,\nthen $u$ and $v$ may be chosen such that $uf+vg = 1$.\\\n**Corollary 3.** If a product of polynomials in $K[X]$ is divisible by\nan irreducible polynomial of $K[X]$, then at least one of the product is\ndivisible by the irreducible polynomial.\\\n**Corollary 4.** A polynomial ring over a field is always a principal\nideal domain.\\\n**Corollary 5.** The factorisation of a non-zero polynomial, i.e. the of\nthe polynomial as product of irreducible polynomials, is unique up to\nconstant factors in each polynomial ring $K[X]$ over a field $K$\ncontaining the polynomial. Especially, $K[X]$ is a UFD.\\\n**Example.** The factorisations of the trinomial $X^4-X^2-2$ into monic\nirreducible prime factors are\\\n$(X^2-2)(X^2+1)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$,\\\n$(X^2-2)(X+i)(X-i)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(i)[X]$,\\\n$(X+\\sqrt{2})(X-\\sqrt{2})(X^2+1)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})[X]$,\\\n$(X+\\sqrt{2})(X-\\sqrt{2})(X+i)(X-i)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\,i)[X]$.",
