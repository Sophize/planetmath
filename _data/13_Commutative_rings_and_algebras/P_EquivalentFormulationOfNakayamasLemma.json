  "statement": "The following is equivalent to Nakayama\u2019s lemma.\n\nLet $A$ be a ring, $M$ be a finitely-generated $A$-module, $N$ a\nsubmodule of $M$, and ${\\mathfrak{a}}$ an ideal of $A$ contained in its\nJacobson radical. Then $M = {\\mathfrak{a}}M + N \\Rightarrow M=N$.\n\nClearly this statement implies Nakayama\u2019s Lemma, by setting $N$ to $0$.\nTo see that it follows from Nakayama\u2019s Lemma, note first that by the\nsecond isomorphism theorem for modules,\n$$\\frac{{\\mathfrak{a}}M+N}{N} = \\frac{{\\mathfrak{a}}M}{{\\mathfrak{a}}M\\cap N}$$\nand the obvious map\n$${\\mathfrak{a}}M\\to {\\mathfrak{a}}\\frac{M}{N} : am\\mapsto a(m+N)$$ is\nsurjective; the kernel is clearly ${\\mathfrak{a}}M\\cap N$. Thus\n$$\\frac{{\\mathfrak{a}}M+N}{N} \\cong {\\mathfrak{a}}\\frac{M}{N}$$ So from\n$M={\\mathfrak{a}}M+N$ we get $M/N = {\\mathfrak{a}}(M/N)$. Since\n${\\mathfrak{a}}$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $M$, it is\ncontained in the Jacobson radical of $M/N$, so by Nakayama, $M/N=0$,\ni.e. $M=N$.",
