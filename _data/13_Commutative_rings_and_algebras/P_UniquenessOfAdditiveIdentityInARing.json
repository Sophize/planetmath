  "statement": "Let $R$ be a ring. There exists a unique element $0$ in $R$ such that\nfor all $a$ in $R$: $$0+a=a+0=a.$$\n\nBy the definition of ring, there exists at least one identity in $R$,\ncall it $0_1$. Suppose $0_2\\in R$ is an element which also the of\nadditive identity. Thus, $$0_2+0_1=0_2$$ On the other hand, $0_1$ is an\nadditive identity, therefore: $$0_2+0_1=0_1+0_2=0_1$$ Hence $0_2=0_1$,\ni.e. there is a unique additive identity.",
