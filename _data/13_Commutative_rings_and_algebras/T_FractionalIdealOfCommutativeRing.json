  "definition": "**Definition.** Let $R$ be a commutative ring having a regular element\nand let $T$ be the total ring of fractions of $R$. An $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\n$T$ is called [*fractional ideal*]{} of $R$, provided that there exists\na regular element $d$ of $R$ such that $\\mathfrak{a}d \\subseteq R$. If a\nfractional ideal is contained in $R$, it is a usual ideal of $R$, and we\ncan call it an [*integral ideal*]{} of $R$.\\\nNote that a fractional ideal of $R$ is not necessarily a subring of $T$.\nThe set of all fractional ideals of $R$ form under the multiplication an\ncommutative semigroup with identity element $R' = R\\!+\\!\\mathbb{Z}e$,\nwhere $e$ is the unity of $T$.\n\nAn ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ ( or fractional) of $R$ is called\n[*invertible*]{}, if there exists another ideal $\\mathfrak{a}^{-1}$ of\n$R$ such that $\\mathfrak{aa}^{-1} = R'$. It is not hard to show that any\ninvertible ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is finitely generated and , moreover\nthat the [*inverse ideal*]{} $\\mathfrak{a}^{-1}$ is uniquely determined\n(see the entry \u201c\u201d) and may be generated by the as $\\mathfrak{a}$.\n\nThe set of all invertible fractional ideals of $R$ forms an Abelian\ngroup under the multiplication. This group has a normal subgroup\nconsisting of all regular principal fractional ideals; the corresponding\nfactor group is called the of the ring $R$.\\\n**Note.** In the special case that the ring $R$ has a unity 1, $R$\nitself is the principal ideal (1), being the identity element of the\nsemigroup of fractional ideals and the group of invertible fractional\nideals. It is called the [*unit ideal*]{}. The unit ideal is the only\nintegral ideal containing units of the ring.",
