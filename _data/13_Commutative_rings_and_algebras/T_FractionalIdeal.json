  "definition": "Basics\n======\n\nLet $A$ be an integral domain with field of fractions $K$. Then $K$ is\nan $A$\u2013module, and we define a [*fractional ideal*]{} of $A$ to be a\nsubmodule of $K$ which is finitely generated as an $A$\u2013module.\n\nThe product of two fractional ideals ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ and\n${{\\mathfrak{b}}}$ of $A$ is defined to be the submodule of $K$\ngenerated by all the products $x \\cdot y\n\\in K$, for $x \\in {{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ and $y \\in {{\\mathfrak{b}}}$. This\nproduct is denoted ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}\\cdot {{\\mathfrak{b}}}$, and it is\nalways a fractional ideal of $A$ as well. Note that, if $A$ itself is\nconsidered as a fractional ideal of $A$, then\n${{\\mathfrak{a}}}\\cdot A = {{\\mathfrak{a}}}$. Accordingly, the set of\nfractional ideals is always a monoid under this product operation, with\nidentity element $A$.\n\nWe say that a fractional ideal ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ is [*invertible*]{} if\nthere exists a fractional ideal ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}'$ such that\n${{\\mathfrak{a}}}\\cdot {{\\mathfrak{a}}}' = A$. It can be shown that if\n${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ is invertible, then its inverse must be\n${{\\mathfrak{a}}}' =\n(A:{{\\mathfrak{a}}})$, the annihilator[^1] of ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ in $A$.\n\nFractional ideals in Dedekind domains\n=====================================\n\nWe now suppose that $A$ is a Dedekind domain. In this case, every\nnonzero fractional ideal is invertible, and consequently the nonzero\nfractional ideals in $A$ form a group under ideal multiplication, called\nthe [*ideal group*]{} of $A$.\n\nThe [*unique factorization of ideals*]{} theorem states that every\nfractional ideal in $A$ factors uniquely into a finite product of prime\nideals of $A$ and their (fractional ideal) inverses. It follows that the\nideal group of $A$ is freely generated as an abelian group by the\nnonzero prime ideals of $A$.\n\nA fractional ideal of $A$ is said to be [*principal*]{} if it is\ngenerated as an $A$\u2013module by a single element. The set of nonzero\nprincipal fractional ideals is a subgroup of the ideal group of $A$, and\nthe quotient group of the ideal group of $A$ by the subgroup of\nprincipal fractional ideals is nothing other than the ideal class group\nof $A$.\n\n[^1]: In general, for any fractional ideals ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ and\n    ${{\\mathfrak{b}}}$, the annihilator of ${{\\mathfrak{b}}}$ in\n    ${{\\mathfrak{a}}}$ is the fractional ideal\n    $({{\\mathfrak{a}}}:{{\\mathfrak{b}}})$ consisting of all $x \\in K$\n    such that $x\\cdot{{\\mathfrak{b}}}\\subset {{\\mathfrak{a}}}$.",
