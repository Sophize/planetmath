  "definition": "Let $R$ be a unital ring. In the following modules will be left modules.\n\nWe will say that $R$ has *the free submodule property* if for any free\nmodule $F$ over $R$ and any submodule $F'\\subseteq F$ we have that $F'$\nis also free. It is well known, that if $R$ is a PID, then $R$ has the\nfree submodule property. One can ask whether the converse is also true?\nWe will try to answer this question.\n\n**Proposition.** If $R$ is a commutative ring, which is not a PID, then\n$R$ does not have the free submodule property.\n\n*Proof.* Assume that $R$ is not a PID. Then there are two possibilities:\neither $R$ is not a domain or there is an ideal $I\\subseteq R$ which is\nnot principal. Assume that $R$ is not a domain and let $a,b\\in R$ be two\nzero divisors, i.e. $a\\neq 0$, $b\\neq 0$ and $a\\cdot b=0$. Let\n$(b)\\subseteq R$ be an ideal generated by $b$. Then obviously $(b)$ is a\nsubmodule of $R$ (regarded as a $R$-module). Assume that $(b)$ is free.\nIn particular there exists $m \\in (b)$, $m\\neq 0$ such that $r\\cdot m=0$\nif and only if $r=0$. But $m$ is of the form $\\lambda\\cdot b$ and\nbecause $R$ is commutative we have\n$$a\\cdot m=a\\cdot (\\lambda\\cdot b)=\\lambda\\cdot (a\\cdot b)=0.$$\nContradiction, because $a\\neq 0$. Thus $(b)$ is not free although $(b)$\nis a submodule of a free module $R$.\n\nAssume now that there is an ideal $I\\subseteq R$ which is not principal\nand assume that $I$ is free as a $R$-module. Since $I$ is not principal,\nthen there exist $a,b\\in I$ such that $\\{a,b\\}$ is linearly independent.\nOn the other hand $a,b\\in R$ and $1$ is a free generator of $R$. Thus\n$\\{1,a\\}$ is linearly dependent, so $$\\lambda\\cdot 1+ \\alpha\\cdot a=0$$\nfor some nonzero $\\lambda, \\alpha\\in R$ (note that in this case both\n$\\lambda,\\alpha$ are nonzero, more precisely $\\lambda=a$ and\n$\\alpha=-1$). Multiply the equation by $b$. Thus we have\n$$\\lambda\\cdot b + (\\alpha\\cdot b)\\cdot a=0.$$ Note that here we used\ncommutativity of $R$. Since $\\{a,b\\}$ is linearly independend (in $I$),\nthen the last equation implies that $\\lambda=0$. Contradiction.\n$\\square$\n\n**Corollary.** Commutative ring is a PID if and only if it has the free\nsubmodule property.",
