  "definition": "Let $F$ be a field (ring) together with a derivation\n$(\\cdot)' \\colon F \\to F$. The derivation must satisfy two properties:\n\nAdditivity\n\n:   $(a+b)' = a' + b'$;\n\nLeibniz\u2019 Rule\n\n:   $(ab)' = a'b+ab'$.\n\nA derivation is the algebraic abstraction of a derivative from ordinary\ncalculus. Thus the terms *derivation*, *derivative*, and *differential*\nare often used interchangeably.\n\nTogether, $(F,{}')$ is referred to as a *differential field (ring)*. The\nsubfield (subring) of all elements with vanishing derivative,\n$K=\\{ a\\in F \\mid a'=0 \\}$, is called the *field (ring) of constants*.\nClearly, $(\\cdot)'$ is $K$-linear.\n\nThere are many notations for the derivation symbol, for example $a'$ may\nalso be denoted as $da$, $\\delta a$, $\\del a$, etc. When there is more\nthan one derivation $\\del_i$, $(F,\\{\\del_i\\})$ is referred to as a\n*partial differential field (ring)*.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nDifferential fields and rings (together under the name of differential\nalgebra) are a natural setting for the study of algebraic properties of\nderivatives and anti-derivatives (indefinite integrals), as well as\nordinary and partial differential equations and their solutions. There\nis an abundance of examples drawn from these areas.\n\n-   The trivial example is a field $F$ with $a'=0$ for each $a\\in F$.\n    Here, nothing new is gained by introducing the derivation.\n\n-   The most common example is the field of rational functions\n    $\\mathbb{R}(z)$ over an indeterminant satisfying $z'=1$. The field\n    of constants is $\\mathbb{R}$. This is the setting for ordinary\n    calculus.\n\n-   Another example is $\\mathbb{R}(x,y)$ with two derivations $\\del_x$\n    and $\\del_y$. The field of constants is $\\mathbb{R}$ and the\n    derivations are extended to all elements from the properties\n    $\\del_x x=1$, $\\del_y y = 1$, and $\\del_x y = \\del_y x = 0$.\n\n-   Consider the set of smooth functions $C^\\infty(M)$ on a manifold\n    $M$. They form a ring (or a field if we allow formal inversion of\n    functions vanishing in some places). Vector fields on $M$ act\n    naturally as derivations on $C^\\infty(M)$.\n\n-   Let $A$ be an algebra and $U_t = \\exp(tu)$ be a one-parameter\n    subgroup of automorphisms of $A$. Here $u$ is the infinitesimal\n    generator of these automorphisms. From the properties of $U_t$, $u$\n    must be a linear operator on $A$ that satisfies the Leibniz rule\n    $u(ab)=u(a)b+au(b)$. So $(A,u)$ can be considered a differential\n    ring.",
