  "definition": "**Definition.** Let\u2019s consider some set of ideals (left, right or\ntwo-sided) of a ring. The [*sum of the ideals*]{} is the smallest ideal\nof the ring containing all those ideals. The sum of ideals is denoted by\nusing \u201c+\u201d and \u201c$\\sum$\u201d as usually.\\\nIt is not difficult to be persuaded of the following:\n\n-   The sum of a finite amount of ideals is\n    $$\\mathfrak{a}_1+\\mathfrak{a}_2+\\cdots+\\mathfrak{a}_k \\;=\\; \n       \\{a_1\\!+\\!a_2\\!+\\!\\cdots\\!+\\!a_k\\,\\vdots \\quad a_i \\in \\mathfrak{a}_i \n        \\,\\,\\forall i\\}.$$\n\n-   The sum of any set of ideals consists of all finite sums\n    $\\displaystyle\\sum_j a_j$ where every $a_j$ belongs to one\n    $\\mathfrak{a}_j$ of those ideals.\n\nThus, one can say that the sum ideal is [*generated by*]{} the set of\nall elements of the individual ideals; in fact it suffices to use all\ngenerators of these ideals.\\\nLet $\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b} = \\mathfrak{d}$ in a ring $R$. Because\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{d}$ and\n$\\mathfrak{b} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{d}$, we can say that $\\mathfrak{d}$ is\na of both $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$.[^1] Moreover,\n$\\mathfrak{d}$ is contained in every common factor $\\mathfrak{c}$ of\n$\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$ by virtue of its minimality. Hence,\n$\\mathfrak{d}$ may be called the [*greatest common divisor*]{} of the\nideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$. The notations\n$$\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b} \\;=\\; \\gcd(\\mathfrak{a},\\,\\mathfrak{b}) \\;=\\; (\\mathfrak{a}, \\,\\mathfrak{b})$$\nare used, too.\n\nIn an analogous way, the intersection of ideals may be designated as the\n[*least common* ]{} of the ideals.\\\nThe by \u201c$\\subseteq$\u201d partially ordered set of all ideals of a ring forms\na lattice, where the least upper bound of $\\mathfrak{a}$ and\n$\\mathfrak{b}$ is $\\mathfrak{a+b}$ and the greatest lower bound is\n$\\mathfrak{a\\cap b}$. See also the example 3 in algebraic lattice.\n\n[^1]: This may be motivated by the situation in $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    $(n) \\subseteq (m)$ iff $m$ is a factor of $n$.",
