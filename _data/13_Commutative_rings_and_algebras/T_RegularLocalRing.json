  "definition": "A local ring $R$ of dimension $n$ is *regular* if and only if its\nmaximal ideal ${\\mathfrak{m}}$ is generated by $n$ elements.\n\nEquivalently, $R$ is regular if\n$\\dim_{R/{\\mathfrak{m}}}{\\mathfrak{m}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}^2=\\dim R$, where\nthe first dimension is that of a vector space, and the latter is the\nKrull dimension, since by Nakayama\u2019s lemma, elements generate\n${\\mathfrak{m}}$ if and only if their images under the projection\ngenerate ${\\mathfrak{m}}/{\\mathfrak{m}}^2$.\n\nBy Krull\u2019s principal ideal theorem, ${\\mathfrak{m}}$ cannot be generated\nby fewer than $n$ elements, so the maximal ideals of regular local rings\nhave a minimal number of generators.",
