  "statement": "Here the valuations are of rank one, and it may be supposed that the\nvalues are real numbers.\n\n-   Assume a finite field extension $K/k$ and a valuation of $K$. If the\n    base field is with regard to this valuation, so is also the\n    extension field.\n\n-   If $K/k$ is an algebraic field extension and if the base field $k$\n    is with regard to its valuation $|\\cdot|$, then this valuation has\n    one and only one extension to the field $K$. This extension is\n    determined by\n    $$|\\alpha| = \\sqrt[n]{|N(\\alpha)|}\\quad (\\alpha \\in K),$$ where\n    $N(\\alpha)$ is the norm of the element $\\alpha$ in the simple field\n    extension $k(\\alpha)/k$ and $n$ is the degree of this field\n    extension.\n\nThese theorems concern also Archimedean valuations.",
