  "argumentText": "Let $M$ be a finitely generated torsion-free module over a Pr\u00fcfer domain\n$R$ with field of fractions $k$. We show that $M$ is isomorphic to a of\nfinitely generated ideals in $R$.\n\nWe shall write $k\\otimes M$ for the vector space over $k$ generated by\n$M$. This is just the of $M$ at $R\\setminus\\{0\\}$ and, as $M$ is\ntorsion-free, the natural map $M\\rightarrow k\\otimes M$ is one-to-one\nand we can regard $M$ as a subset of $k\\otimes M$.\n\nAs $M$ is finitely generated, the vector space $k\\otimes M$ will , and\nwe use induction on its dimension $n$. Supposing that $n>0$, choose any\nbasis $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$ and define the linear map\n$f\\colon k\\otimes M\\rightarrow k$ by onto the first component,\n$$f(x_1e_1+\\cdots+x_ne_n)=x_1.$$ Restricting to $M$, this gives a\nnonzero map $M\\rightarrow k$. Furthermore, as $M$ is finitely generated,\n$f(M)$ will be a finitely generated fractional ideal in $k$. Choosing\nany nonzero $c\\in R$ such that $\\mathfrak{a}\\equiv cf(M)\\subseteq R$,\n$$g\\colon M\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{a},\\ g(u)=cf(u)$$ defines a homorphism\nfrom $M$ onto the nonzero and finitely generated ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$.\nAs $R$ is Pr\u00fcfer and invertible ideals are projective, $g$ has a\nright-inverse $h\\colon\\mathfrak{a}\\rightarrow M$. Then $h$ has the\nleft-inverse $g$ and is one-to-one, so defines an isomorphism between\n$\\mathfrak{a}$ and its . We decompose $M$ as the direct sum of the\nkernel of $g$ and the image of $h$,\n$$M = \\operatorname{ker}(g)\\oplus \\operatorname{Im}(h)\\cong\\operatorname{ker}(g)\\oplus \\mathfrak{a}.$$\nProjection from the finitely generated module $M$ onto\n$\\operatorname{ker}(g)$ shows that it is finitely generated and,\n$$\\operatorname{dim}(k\\otimes\\operatorname{ker}(g))=\\operatorname{dim}(k\\otimes M)-\\operatorname{dim}(k\\otimes\\mathfrak{a})=n-1.$$\nSo, the result follows from applying the induction hypothesis to\n$\\operatorname{ker}(g)$.",
