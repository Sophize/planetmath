  "definition": "In the derivation of Sylvester\u2019s matrix for the resultant, it was seen\nthat if two polynomials have a common root, then Sylvester\u2019s determinant\nwill equal zero. Since two polynomials have a common root if and only if\ntheir resultant is zero, it follows that if the resultant is zero, then\nSylvester\u2019s determinant equals zero. In this entry, we shall use this\nfact to show that Sylvester\u2019s determinant equals the resultant.\n\nThe secret is to view both Sylvester\u2019s determinant and the resultant as\nfunctions of the roots. A more precise way of saying what this means is\nthat we will study polnomials in the indeterminates\n$a_0, r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m, b_0, s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$. We will regard\n$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m, b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ as polynomials in these\nvariables using the expression of coefficients of a polynomial as\nsymmetric functions of its roots, e.g.\n$$a_1 = a_0 (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots)$$\n$$a_2 = a_0 (r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + \\cdots)$$ Note that $a_k$ is a\n$k^{\\hbox{th}}$ order polynomial in the $r_i$\u2019s and $b_k$ is a\n$k^{\\hbox{th}}$ order polynomial in the $s_i$\u2019s.\n\nLet $R$ be the polynomial\n$$R = a_0^n b_0^m \\prod_{i=1}^m \\prod_{j=1}^n (r_i - s_j)$$ and let $D$\nbe the polynomial which is gotten by replacing occurrences of\n$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m, b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$ in Sylvester\u2019s matrix by\ntheir expressions in of\n$a_0, r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_m, b_0, s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$. We want to\nshow that $R = D$.\n\nFirst, note that, in each row of Sylvester\u2019s matrix, every entry is\nmultiplied by either an $a_0$ or a $b_0$. By a fundamental property of\ndeterminants, this means that we may pull all those factors of $a_0$ and\n$b_0$ outside the determinant. Since there are $n$ rows containing $a_0$\nand $m$ rows containing $b_0$, this means that\n$D = a_0^m b_0^n D'(r_1, \\ldots, r_m, s_1, \\ldots, s_n)$. Note that\nthese factors correspond to the powers of $a_0$ and $b_0$ in the\ndefinition of $R$. Hence, to show that $D = R$ it only remains to show\nthat $D' = R'$, where $$R' = \\prod_{i=1}^m \\prod_{j=1}^n (r_i - s_j)$$\n\nSecond, note that the degree of $D'$ is not greater than the degree of\n$R'$. From the definition, it is obvious that $R'$ is a polynomial of\ndegree $mn$. By examining Sylvester\u2019s determinant and keeping in mind\nthat $a_k$ and $b_k$ are of degree $k$, it is not hard to see that the\ndegree of $D'$ cannot exceed $mn$.\n\nThird, we will show that $R'$ divides $D'$. In the derivation of the\nSylvester determinant, we saw that if $r_i = s_j$ for some choice of $i$\nand $j$, then $D=0$, and hence $D'=0$. The only way for a non-zero\npolynomial to to equal zero when $r_i = s_j$ is for $r_i - s_i$ to be a\nfactor of the polynomial. It is easy to see that $D'$ is not the zero\npolynomial, and hence, $s_i - s_j$ must be a factor of $D'$. This means\nthat every factor of $R'$ is also a factor of $D'$. Since all the\nfactors of $R'$ occur with multiplicity one, it follows that $D'$ is a\nmultiple of $R'$.\n\nCombining the of the last two paragraphs, we come to the conclusion that\n$D'$ must be a constant multiple of $R'$. To determine the constant of\nproportionality, all one needs to do is to compare the values of the two\npolynomials for a set of value of the variables for which they to not\nvanish. For instance, one could try $r_1 = r_2 = \\cdots = r_m = 1$ and\n$s_1 = s_2 = \\cdots = s_n = 0$. Both $R'$ and $D'$ equal $1$ for this\nspecial set of values, and hence $R' = D'$.",
