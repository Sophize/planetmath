  "definition": "Let $R = \\oplus_{g\\in G} R_g$ be a graded ring. Then an element $r$ of\n$R$ is said to be *homogeneous* if it is an element of some $R_g$. An\nideal $I$ of $R$ is said to be homogeneous if it can be generated by a\nset of homogeneous elements, or equivalently if it is the ideal\ngenerated by the set of elements $\\bigcup_{g\\in G} I\\cap R_g$.\n\nOne observes that if $I$ is a homogeneous ideal and $r=\\sum_i r_{g_i}$\nis the sum of homogeneous elements $r_{g_i}$ for distinct $g_i$, then\neach $r_{g_i}$ must be in $I$.\n\nTo see some examples, let $k$ be a field, and take $R=k[X_1,X_2,X_3]$\nwith the usual grading by total degree. Then the ideal generated by\n$X_1^n+X_2^n-X_3^n$ is a homogeneous ideal. It is also a radical ideal.\nOne reason homogeneous ideals in $k[X_1,\\ldots,X_n]$ are of interest is\nbecause (if they are radical) they define projective varieties; in this\ncase the projective variety is the curve. For contrast, the ideal\ngenerated by $X_1+X_2^2$ is not homogeneous.",
