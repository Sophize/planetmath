  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring having at least one regular element and\n$T$ its total ring of fractions. Let $\\mathfrak{a} := \n(a_0,\\,a_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_{m-1})$ and $\\mathfrak{b} := \n(b_0,\\,b_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,b_{n-1})$ be two fractional ideals of $R$ (see the\nentry \u201cfractional ideal of commutative ring\u201d). Then the product\nsubmodule $\\mathfrak{ab}$ of $T$ is also a of $R$ and is generated by\nall the elements $a_ib_j$, thus having a generating set of $mn$\nelements.\n\nSuch a generating set may be condensed in the case of any Dedekind\ndomain, especially for the of any algebraic number field one has the\nmultiplication formula $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathfrak{ab} = (a_0b_0,\\,a_0b_1\\!+\\!a_1b_0,\\,a_0b_2\\!+\\!a_1b_1\\!+\\!a_2b_0,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_{m-1}b_{n-1}).\\end{aligned}$$\nHere, the number of generators is only $m\\!+\\!n\\!-\\!1$ (in principle,\nevery ideal of a Dedekind domain has a ). The formula is still for a\nwider class of rings $R$ which may contain zero divisors, viz. for the\nPr\u00fcfer rings (see \\[1\\]), but then at least one of $\\mathfrak{a}$ and\n$\\mathfrak{b}$ must be a regular ideal.\n\nNote that the generators in (1) are formed similarly as the coefficients\nin the product of the polynomials\n$f(X) := f_0\\!+\\!f_1X\\!+\\cdots+\\!f_{m-1}X^{m-1}$ and\n$g(X) := g_0\\!+\\!g_1X\\!+\\cdots+\\!g_{n-1}X^{n-1}$. Thus we may call the\nfractional ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$ of $R$ the\n[*coefficient modules*]{} $\\mathfrak{m}_f$ and $\\mathfrak{m}_g$ of the\npolynomials $f$ and $g$ (they are $R$-modules). Hence the formula (1)\nmay be rewritten as $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathfrak{m}_f\\mathfrak{m}_g = \\mathfrak{m}_{fg}.\\end{aligned}$$ This\nformula says the same as Gauss\u2019s lemma I for a unique factorization\ndomain $R$.\n\nArnold and Gilmer \\[2\\] have presented and proved the following\ngeneralisation of (2) which is valid under much less stringent\nassumptions than the ones requiring $R$ to be a Pr\u00fcfer ring (initially:\na Pr\u00fcfer domain); the proof is somewhat simplified in \\[1\\].\n\n**Theorem (Dedekind\u2013Mertens lemma)**. Let $R$ be a subring of a\ncommutative ring $T$. If $f$ and $g$ are two arbitrary polynomials in\nthe polynomial ring $T[X]$, then there exists a non-negative integer $n$\nsuch that the $R$-submodules of $T$ generated by the coefficients of the\npolynomials $f$, $g$ and $fg$ satisfy the equality $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathfrak{m}_f^{n+1}\\,\\mathfrak{m}_g = \\mathfrak{m}_f^n\\,\\mathfrak{m}_{fg}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n[9]{} \u201c[Some formulae for multiplying and inverting ideals]{}\u201d. \u2013 [*Ann.\nUniv.
