  "definition": "If $p$ and $q$ are two polynomials over a commutative ring with identity\nwhich can be factored into linear factors\n$$p(x) = a_0 (x - r_1) (x - r_2) \\cdots (x - r_m)$$\n$$q(x) = b_0 (x - s_1) (x - s_2) \\cdots (x - s_n)$$ then the *resultant*\n$R(f,g)$ of $f$ and $g$ is defined as\n$$R(p,q) = a_0^n b_0^m \\prod_{i=1}^m \\prod_{j=1}^n (r_i - s_j)$$\n\nFrom the definition, it is clear that the resultant will equal zero if\nand only if $p$ and $q$ have at least one common root. By grouping\ntogether factors, we may also rewrite the resultant as\n$$R(p,q) = a_0^n \\prod_{i=1}^m q(r_i)$$ or\n$$R(p,q) = (-1)^{mn} b_0^m \\prod_{j=1}^n p(s_j)$$\n\nSince the resultant is a symmetric function of the roots of the\npolynomials $p$ and $q$, it can be expressed as a polynomial in the\ncoefficients of $p$ and $q$. This allows one to extend the definition to\nthe case where $p$ and $q$ do not factor. An explicit formula for the\nresultant as a determinant was given by Sylvester. Suppose that\n$$p(x) = a_0 x^m + a_1 x^{m-1} + \\cdots + a_{m-1} x + a_m$$ and\n$$q(x) = b_0 x^n + b_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + b_{n-1} x + b_n$$ Then\n$R(p,q)$ can be expressd as an $(m+n) \\times (m+n)$ determinant:\n$$\\left| \\begin {matrix}\na_0 & a_1 & a_2 & \\ldots & a_m & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\cr\n0 & a_0 & a_1 & \\ldots & a_{m-1} & a_m & \\ldots & 0 \\cr\n& & \\ddots & . & . & . & . & . \\cr\n0 & 0 & . & . & . & . & . & a_m \\cr\nb_0 & b_1 & b_2 & \\ldots & b_n & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\cr\n0 & b_0 & b_1 & \\ldots & b_{n-1} & b_n & \\ldots & 0 \\cr\n& & \\ddots & . & . & . & . & . \\cr\n0 & 0 & . & . & . & . & . &  b_n \\cr\n\\end{matrix} \\right| = R(p,q)$$ To construct this determinant, one first\nlists the coefficients of $p$, padded with zeros at the end, then\nconstructs subsequent rows by shifting one column to the right each time\nuntil one runs out of zeros at the end, then one repeats the same\nprocedure with $q$.\n\nResultants are very useful for solving simultaneous systems of\npolynomial equations. Suppose that one has a system of two equations\n$f(x,y) = 0, g(x,y) = 0$. Then $f$ and $g$ can be regarded as\npolynomials in $x$ whose coefficients are functions of $y$. One can then\nform the resultant by computing the determinant of a matrix as above.\nSince the coefficients were polynomials in $y$, the resultant will be a\npolynomial in $y$. In for the two equations to have a solution, the\nresultant must equal zero; hence setting the resultant equal to zero\ngives an equation for the $y$ values of solutions of the system. Once\none solves for these $y$ values, one can substitute them back in to the\noriginal equations and solve for the corresponding $x$ values. In other\n, the resultant allows one to eliminate a variable from a system of\nequations. For this reason, resultants are also known as eliminants.\n\nBy using resultants to eliminate variables repeatedly one variable at a\ntime, one solve systems of equations in more than two unknowns.\n\n[1]{} , *A Method of Determining By Mere Inspection the Derivatives from\nTwo Equations of Any Degree*, Phil.\u00a0Mag. 16 (1840) pp. 132\u2013135.",
