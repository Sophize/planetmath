  "definition": "Decomposition Group\n===================\n\nLet $A$ be a Noetherian integrally closed integral domain with field of\nfractions $K$. Let $L$ be a Galois extension of $K$ and denote by $B$\nthe integral closure of $A$ in $L$. Then, for any prime ideal\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}\\subset A$, the Galois group\n$G := {\\operatorname{Gal}}(L/K)$ acts transitively on the set of all\nprime ideals ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\subset B$ containing ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$.\nIf we fix a particular prime ideal ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\subset B$ lying\nover ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$, then the stabilizer of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ under\nthis group action is a subgroup of $G$, called the [*decomposition\ngroup*]{} at ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ and denoted\n$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$. In other words,\n$$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) := \\{\\sigma \\in G \\mid \\sigma({{\\mathfrak{P}}}) = ({{\\mathfrak{P}}})\\}.$$\nIf ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}' \\subset B$ is another prime ideal of $B$ lying\nover ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$, then the decomposition groups\n$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ and\n$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}'/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ are conjugate in $G$ via any\nGalois automorphism mapping ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ to ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}'$.\n\nInertia Group\n=============\n\nWrite $l$ for the residue field $B/{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ and $k$ for the\nresidue field $A/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$. Assume that the extension $l/k$ is\nseparable (if it is not, then this development is still possible, but\nconsiderably more complicated; see\u00a0[@serre p. 20]). Any element\n$\\sigma \\in\nD({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$, by definition, fixes\n${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ and hence descends to a well defined automorphism of\nthe field $l$. Since $\\sigma$ also fixes $A$ by virtue of being in $G$,\nit induces an automorphism of the extension $l/k$ fixing $k$. We\ntherefore have a group homomorphism\n$$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) {\\longrightarrow}{\\operatorname{Gal}}(l/k),$$\nand the of this homomorphism is called the [*inertia group*]{} of\n${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$, and written $T({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$.\nIt turns out that this homomorphism is actually surjective, so there is\nan exact sequence $$\\label{exact}\n\\xymatrix{\n1 \\ar[r] & T({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) \\ar[r] & D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) \\ar[r] & {\\operatorname{Gal}}(l/k) \\ar[r] & 1\n}$$\n\nDecomposition of Extensions\n===========================\n\nThe decomposition group is so named because it can be used to decompose\nthe field extension $L/K$ into a series of intermediate extensions each\nof which has very simple factorization behavior at ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$.\nIf we let $L^D$ denote the fixed field of\n$D({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ and $L^T$ the fixed field of\n$T({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$, then the exact sequence\u00a0\ncorresponds under Galois theory to the lattice of fields $$\\xymatrix{\nL \\ar@{-}[d]^e \\\\\nL^T \\ar@{-}[d]^f \\\\\nL^D \\ar@{-}[d]^g \\\\\nK\n}$$ If we write $e,f,g$ for the degrees of these intermediate extensions\nas in the diagram, then we have the following remarkable series of\nequalities:\n\n1.  The number $e$ equals the ramification index\n    $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$, which is independent of the choice of prime\n    ideal ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ lying over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ since $L/K$\n    is Galois.\n\n2.  The number $f$ equals the inertial degree\n    $f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$, which is also independent of the choice of prime\n    ideal ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ since $L/K$ is Galois.\n\n3.  The number $g$ is equal to the number of prime ideals\n    ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ of $B$ that lie over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}\\subset A$.\n\nFurthermore, the fields $L^D$ and $L^T$ have the following independent\ncharacterizations:\n\n-   $L^T$ is the smallest intermediate field $F$ such that\n    ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ is totally ramified over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\cap F$, and it is the largest intermediate field\n    such that $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\cap F, {{\\mathfrak{p}}}) = 1$.\n\n-   $L^D$ is the smallest intermediate field $F$ such that\n    ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ is the only prime of $B$ lying over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\cap F$, and it is the largest intermediate field\n    such that\n    $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\cap F, {{\\mathfrak{p}}}) = f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\cap F, {{\\mathfrak{p}}}) =\n      1$.\n\nInformally, this decomposition of the extension says that the extension\n$L^D/K$ encapsulates all of the factorization of ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ into\ndistinct primes, while the extension $L^T/L^D$ is the source of all the\ninertial degree in ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and the\nextension $L/L^T$ is responsible for all of the ramification that occurs\nover ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$.\n\nLocalization\n============\n\nThe decomposition groups and inertia groups of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ behave\nwell under localization. That is, the decomposition and inertia groups\nof ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\subset B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\nthe prime ideal ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}A_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ in the localization\n$A_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ of $A$ are identical to the ones obtained using $A$\nand $B$ themselves. In fact, the same holds true even in the completions\nof the local rings $A_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and $B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ at\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$.\n\n[9]{} J.P.
