  "definition": "Let $K$ be an extension field of $F$ and let $a\\in K$.\n\nIf there is a nonzero polynomial $f\\in F[x]$ such that $f(a)=0$ (in $K$)\nwe say that $a$ is *algebraic over $F$*.\n\nFor example, $\\sqrt{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nsince there is a nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients, namely\n$f(x)=x^2-2$, such that $f(\\sqrt{2})=0$.\n\nIf all elements of $K$ are algebraic over $F$, one says that the [*field\nextension*]{} $K/F$ is [*algebraic*]{}.",
