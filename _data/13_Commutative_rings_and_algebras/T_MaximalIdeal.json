A proper left (right, two-sided) ideal\n$\\mathfrak{m} \\subsetneq R$ is said to be [*maximal*]{} if\n$\\mathfrak{m}$ is not a proper subset of any other proper left (right,\ntwo-sided) ideal of $R$.\n\nOne can prove:\n\n-   A left ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal if and only if\n    $R/\\mathfrak{m}$ is a simple left $R$-module.\n\n-   A right ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal if and only if\n    $R/\\mathfrak{m}$ is a simple right $R$-module.\n\n-   A two-sided ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal if and only if\n    $R/\\mathfrak{m}$ is a simple ring.\n\nAll maximal ideals are prime ideals. If $R$ is commutative, an ideal\n$\\mathfrak{m} \\subset R$ is maximal if and only if the quotient ring\n$R/\\mathfrak{m}$ is a field.",
