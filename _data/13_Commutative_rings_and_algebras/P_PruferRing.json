  "statement": "**Definition.** A commutative ring $R$ with non-zero unity is a *Pr\u00fcfer\nring* (cf. Pr\u00fcfer domain) if every finitely generated regular ideal of\n$R$ is invertible. (It can be proved that if every ideal of $R$\ngenerated by two elements is invertible, then all finitely generated\nideals are invertible; cf. invertibility of regularly generated ideal.)\n\nDenote generally by $\\mathfrak{m}_p$ the $R$-module generated by the\ncoefficients of a polynomial $p$ in $T[x]$, where $T$ is the total ring\nof fractions of $R$. Such [*coefficient modules*]{} are, of course,\nfractional ideals of $R$.\\\n**Theorem 1 (Pahikkala 1982).** Let $R$ be a commutative ring with\nnon-zero unity and let $T$ be the total ring of fractions of $R$. Then,\n$R$ is a Pr\u00fcfer ring iff the equation $$\\begin{aligned}\n        \\mathfrak{m}_f\\mathfrak{m}_g = \\mathfrak{m}_{fg}\\end{aligned}$$\nholds whenever $f$ and $g$ belong to the polynomial ring $T[x]$ and at\nleast one of the fractional ideals $\\mathfrak{m}_f$ and $\\mathfrak{m}_g$\nis . (See also product of finitely generated ideals.)\\\n**Theorem 2 (Pahikkala 1982).** The commutative ring $R$ with non-zero\nunity is Pr\u00fcfer ring iff the multiplication rule\n$$(a,\\,b)(c,\\,d) = (ac,\\,ad+bc,\\,bd)$$ for the integral ideals of $R$\nholds whenever at least one of the generators $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ is\nnot zero divisor.\\\nThe proofs are found in the paper\n\nJ.
