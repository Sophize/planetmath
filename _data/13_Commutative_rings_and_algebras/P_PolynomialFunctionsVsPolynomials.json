  "statement": "Let $k$ be a field. Recall that a function $$f:k\\to k$$ is called\npolynomial function, iff there are $a_0,\\ldots,a_n\\in k$ such that\n$$f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots +a_nx^n$$ for any $x\\in k$.\n\nThe ring of all polynomial functions (together with obvious addition and\nmultiplication) we denote by $k\\{x\\}$. Also denote by $k[x]$ the ring of\npolynomials (see for details).\n\nThere is a canonical function $T:k[x]\\to k\\{x\\}$ such that for any\npolynomial $$W=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\cdot x^i$$ we have that $T(W)$ is a\npolynomial function given by $$T(W)(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\cdot x^i.$$\n(Although we use the same notation for polynomials and polynomial\nfunctions these concepts are not the same). This function is called the\n**evaluation map**. As a simple exercise we leave the following to the\nreader:\n\n**Proposition 1.** The evaluation map $T$ is a ring homomorphisms which\nis ,,onto\u201d.\n\nThe question is: when $T$ is ,,1-1\u201d?\n\n**Proposition 2.** $T$ is ,,1-1\u201d if and only if $k$ is an infinite\nfield.\n\n*Proof.* ,,$\\Rightarrow$\u201d Assume that $k=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}$ is a finite\nfield. Put $$W=(x-a_1)\\cdots (x-a_n).$$ Then for any $x\\in k$ we have\nthat $x=a_i$ for some $i$ and\n$$T(W)(x)=(x-a_1)\\cdots (x-a_n)=(a_i-a_1)\\cdots (a_i-a_i)\\cdots (a_i-a_n)=0$$\nwhich shows that $W\\in\\mathrm{Ker}T$ although $W$ is nonzero. Thus $T$\nis not ,,1-1\u201d.\n\n,,$\\Leftarrow$\u201d Assume, that $$W=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\cdot x^i$$ is a\npolynomial with positive degree, i.e. $n\\geqslant 1$ and $a_n\\neq 0$\nsuch that $T(W)$ is a zero function. It follows from the Bezout\u2019s\ntheorem that $W$ has at most $n$ roots (in fact this is true over any\nintegral domain). Thus since $k$ is an infinite field, then there exists\n$a\\in k$ which is not a root of $W$. In particular $$T(W)(a)\\neq 0.$$\nContradiction, since $T(W)$ is a zero function. Thus $T$ is ,,1-1\u201d,\nwhich completes the proof. $\\square$\n\nThis shows that the evaluation map $T$ is an isomorphism only when $k$\nis infinite. So the interesting question is what is a kernel of $T$,\nwhen $k$ is a finite field?\n\n**Proposition 3.** Assume that $k=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}$ is a finite field\nand $$W=(x-a_1)\\cdots (x-a_n).$$ Then $T(W)=0$ and if $T(U)=0$ for some\npolynomial $U$, then $W$ divides $U$. In particular\n$$\\mathrm{Ker}T=(W).$$\n\n*Proof.* In the proof of proposition 2 we\u2019ve shown that $T(W)=0$. Now if\n$T(U)=0$, then every $a_i$ is a root of $U$. It follows from the\nBezout\u2019s theorem that $(x-a_i)$ must divide $U$ for any $i$. In\nparticular $W$ divides $U$. This (together with the fact that $T(W)=0$)\nshows that the ideal $\\mathrm{Ker}T$ is generated by $W$. $\\square$.\n\n**Corollary 4.** If $k$ is a finite field of order $q>1$, then $k\\{x\\}$\nhas exactly $q^q$ elements.\n\n*Proof.* Let $k=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_q\\}$ and $$W=(x-a_1)\\cdots (x-a_q).$$ By\npropositions 1 and 3 (and due to First Isomorphism Theorem for rings) we\nhave that $$k\\{x\\}\\simeq k[x]/(W).$$ But the degree of $W$ is equal to\n$q$. It follows that dimension of $k[x]/(W)$ (as a vector space over\n$k$) is equal to $$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}k[x]/(W)=q.$$ Thus $k\\{x\\}$ is\nisomorphic to $q$ copies of $k$ as a vector space\n$$k\\{x\\}\\simeq k\\times\\cdots\\times k.$$ This completes the proof, since\n$k$ has $q$ elements. $\\square$\n\n**Remark.** Also all of this hold, if we replace $k$ with an integral\ndomain (we can always pass to its field of fractions). However this is\nnot really interesting, since finite integral domains are exactly fields\n(Wedderburn\u2019s little theorem).",
