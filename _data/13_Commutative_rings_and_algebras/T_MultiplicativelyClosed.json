  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $S$ of $R$ is said to be *multiplicatively\nclosed* if $S\\ne \\varnothing$, and whenever $a,b\\in S$, then $ab\\in S$.\nIn other words, $S$ is a multiplicative set where the multiplication\ndefined on $S$ is the multiplication inherited from $R$.\n\nFor example, let $a\\in R$, the set\n$S:=\\lbrace a^i, a^{i+1}, \\cdots, a^n, \\cdots \\rbrace$ is\nmultiplicatively closed for any positive integer $i$. Another simple\nexample is the set $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$, if $R$ is unital.\n\n**Remarks**. Let $R$ be a commutative ring.\n\n-   If $P$ is a prime ideal in $R$, then $R-P$ is multiplicatively\n    closed.\n\n-   Furthermore, an ideal maximal with respect to the being disjoint\n    from a multiplicative set not containing $0$ is a prime ideal.\n\n-   In particular, assuming $1\\in R$, any ideal maximal with respect to\n    being disjoint from $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ is a maximal ideal.\n\nA multiplicatively closed set $S$ in a ring $R$ is said to be\n*saturated* if for any $a\\in S$, every divisor of $a$ is also in $S$.\n\nIn the example above, if $i=1$ and $a$ has no divisors, then $S$ is\nsaturated.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In a unital ring, a saturated multiplicatively closed set always\n    contains $U(R)$, the group of units of $R$ (since it contains $1$,\n    and therefore, all divisors of $1$). In particular, $U(R)$ itself is\n    saturated multiplicatively closed.\n\n-   Assume $R$ is commutative. $S\\subseteq R$ is saturated\n    multiplicatively closed and $0\\notin S$ iff $R-S$ is a union of\n    prime ideals in $R$.\n\n    This can be shown as follows: if let $T$ be a union of prime ideals\n    in $R$ and $a,b\\in R-T$. if $ab\\notin R-T$, then\n    $ab\\in P\\subseteq T$ for some prime ideal $P$. Therefore, either $a$\n    or $b\\in P\\subseteq T$. This contradicts the assumption that\n    $a,b\\notin T$. So $R-T$ is multiplicatively closed. If $ab \\in R-T$\n    with $a\\notin R-T$, then $a\\in P\\subseteq T$ for some prime ideal\n    $P$, which implies $ab\\in P\\subseteq T$ also. This contradicts the\n    assumption that $ab\\notin T$. This shows that $R-T$ is saturated. Of\n    course, $0\\notin R-T$, since $0$ lies in any ideal of $R$.\n\n    Conversely, assume $S$ is saturated multiplicatively closed and\n    $0\\notin S$. For any $r\\notin S$, we want to find a prime ideal $P$\n    containing $r$ such that $P\\cap S=\\varnothing$. Once we show this,\n    then take the union $T$ of these prime ideals and that $S=R-T$ is\n    immediate. Let $\\langle r\\rangle$ be the principal ideal generated\n    by $r$. Since $S$ is saturated,\n    $\\langle r\\rangle\\cap S=\\varnothing$. Let $M$ be the set of all\n    ideals containing $\\langle r\\rangle$ and disjoint from $S$. $M$ is\n    non-empty by construction, and we can order $M$ by inclusion. So $M$\n    is a poset and Zorn\u2019s lemma applies. Take any chain $C$ in $M$\n    containing $\\langle r\\rangle$ and let $P$ be the maximal element in\n    $C$. Then any ideal larger than $P$ must not be disjoint from $S$,\n    so $P$ is prime by the second remark in the first set of remarks.\n\n-   The notion of multiplicative closure can be generalized to be\n    defined over any non-empty set with a binary operation\n    (multiplication) defined on it.\n\n[3]{} I.
