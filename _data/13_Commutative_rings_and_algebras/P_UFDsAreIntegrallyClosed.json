  "statement": "**Theorem:** Every UFD is integrally closed.\n\n**Proof:** Let $R$ be a UFD, $K$ its field of fractions, $u\\in K, u$\nintegral over $R$. Then for some $c_0,\\ldots,c_{n-1}\\in R$,\n$$u^n+c_{n-1}u^{n-1}+\\ldots+c_0=0$$ Write $u=\\frac{a}{b}, a,b\\in R$,\nwhere $a,b$ have no non-unit common divisor (which we can assume since\n$R$ is a UFD). Multiply the above equation by $b^n$ to get\n$$a^n+c_{n-1}ba^{n-1}+\\ldots+c_0b^n=0$$ Let $d$ be an irreducible\ndivisor of $b$. Then $d$ is prime since $R$ is a UFD. Now, $d\\lvert a^n$\nsince it divides all the other terms and thus (since $d$ is prime)\n$d\\lvert a$. But $a, b$ have no non-unit common divisors, so $d$ is a\nunit. Thus $b$ is a unit and hence $u\\in R$.",
