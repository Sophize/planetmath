  "definition": "Let $K$ be a field. The [*equivalence of valuations*]{} $|\\cdot|_1$ and\n$|\\cdot|_2$ of $K$ may be defined so that\n\n1.  $|\\cdot|_1$ is not the trivial valuation;\n\n2.  if $|a|_1 < 1$ then $|a|_2 < 1 \\qquad \\forall a \\in K.$\n\nIt it easy to see that these conditions imply for both valuations (use\n$\\frac{1}{a}$). Also, we have always\n$$|a|_1 \\leqq 1 \\, \\Leftrightarrow \\, |a|_2 \\leqq 1;$$ so both\nvaluations have a common valuation ring in the case they are\nnon-archimedean. (The of the more general Krull valuations is defined to\nthat they have common valuation rings.) Further, both valuations\ndetermine a common metric on $K$.\n\nTwo valuations (of one) $|\\cdot|_1$ and $|\\cdot|_2$ of $K$ are iff one\nof them is a positive power of the other,\n$$|a|_1 = |a|_2^c \\qquad \\forall a \\in K,$$ where $c$ is a positive .",
