  "statement": "Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions $K$. If $L/K$ is a\nfinite extension of fields and $A$ is the integral closure of $R$ in\n$L$, then $A$ is also a Dedekind domain.\n\nFor example, a number field $K$ is a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$\nand its ring of integers is denoted by $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Although such\nrings can fail to be unique factorization domains, the above theorem\nshows that they are always Dedekind domains and therefore is satisfied.",
