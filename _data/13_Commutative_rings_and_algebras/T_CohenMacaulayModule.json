  "definition": "A module $M$ over a ring $R$ is a Cohen-Macaulay module if its depth is\ndefined and equals its Krull dimension. A ring is said to be\nCohen-Macaulay (or just C-M) if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module viewed as\na module over itself.\n\nCohen-Macaulay rings are used extensively in combinatorial geometry and\ncommutative ring theory, and has applications to algebraic geometry as\nwell. For instance, a variety all of whose local rings are\nCohen-Macaulay has, in a sense, nicer behaviour than an arbitrary\nsingular variety.",
