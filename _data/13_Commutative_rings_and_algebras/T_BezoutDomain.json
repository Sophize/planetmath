  "definition": "A *Bezout domain* $D$ is an integral domain such that every finitely\ngenerated ideal of $D$ is .\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   A PID is obviously a Bezout domain.\n\n-   Furthermore, a Bezout domain is a gcd domain. To see this, suppose\n    $D$ is a Bezout domain with $a,b\\in D$. By definition, there is a\n    $d\\in D$ such that $(d)=(a,b)$, the ideal generated by $a$ and $b$.\n    So $a\\in (d)$ and $b\\in (d)$ and therefore, $d\\mid a$ and $d\\mid b$.\n    Next, suppose $c\\in D$ and that $c\\mid a$ and $c\\mid b$. Then both\n    $a,b\\in (c)$ and so $d\\in (c)$. This means that $c\\mid d$ and we are\n    done.\n\n-   From the discussion above, we see in a Bezout domain $D$, a greatest\n    common divisor exists for every pair of elements. Furthermore, if\n    $\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)$ denotes one such greatest common divisor\n    between $a,b\\in D$, then for some $r,s\\in D$:\n    $$\\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)=ra+sb.$$ The above equation is known as\n    the *Bezout identity*, or Bezout\u2019s Lemma.",
