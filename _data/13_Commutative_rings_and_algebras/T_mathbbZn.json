  "definition": "Let $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. An equivalence relation, called , can be defined\non $\\mathbb{Z}$ by $a \\equiv b \\operatorname{mod} n$ iff $n$ divides\n$b-a$. Note first of all that $a \\equiv b \\operatorname{mod} n$ iff\n$a \\equiv b \\operatorname{mod} |n|$. Thus, without loss of generality,\nonly nonnegative $n$ need be considered. Secondly, note that the case\n$n=0$ is not very interesting. If $a \\equiv b \\operatorname{mod} 0$,\nthen $0$ divides $b-a$, which occurs exactly when $a=b$. In this case,\nthe set of all equivalence classes can be identified with $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, only positive $n$ need be considered. The set of all equivalence\nclasses of $\\mathbb{Z}$ under the given equivalence relation is called\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$.\n\nSome mathematicians consider the notation ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ to be archaic\nand somewhat confusing. This matter of notation is most considerable\nwhen $n=p$ for some $p$, as ${\\mathbb{Z}}_p$ is used to refer to the .\nTo avoid this confusion, some mathematicians use the notation\n$\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ instead of ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$. On the other hand,\nthe notation ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ should not cause confusion when $n$ is not\nprime, and is an intuitive shorthand way to write\n$\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, others use ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$ when $n=p$\nfor some prime $p$ and ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ otherwise. (The explanation of\nthe usage of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ will come later.) Still others, especially\nthose who are unfamiliar with the , use the notation ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$\nexclusively. (In this entry, the notation ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ is used\nexclusively, though it is highly recommended to use another notation\nwhen $n=p$ for some prime $p$.)\n\nOne usually identifies an element of ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ (which is\ntechnically a , ) with the unique element $r$ in the class such that\n$0 \\le r < n$. One can use the division algorithm to establish that, for\neach class, an $r$ as described exists uniquely. (The set of all $r$\u2019s\nas described is an example of a residue system.) Thus, the sets\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ are finite with exactly $n$ elements. Addition and\nmultiplication operations can also be defined on ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ in a\nnatural way that corresponds to the operations on $\\mathbb{Z}$. Under\nthese operations, ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ is a commutative ring with as well as\na cyclic ring with behavior $1$. When $n=p$ for some prime $p$,\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ is a field. In this case, the notation ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$\nhighlights the fact that the is a field. When $n$ is composite,\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ has zero divisors and thus is neither a field nor an\nintegral domain. Also note that ${\\mathbb{Z}}_1$ is a zero ring, since\nall integers are , yielding only one equivalence class.\n\nThe $n$ in both ${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ and $a \\equiv b \\operatorname{mod} n$\nis called the *modulus*. Performing computations such as addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and taking in one of the rings\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_n$ is called *modular arithmetic*.",
