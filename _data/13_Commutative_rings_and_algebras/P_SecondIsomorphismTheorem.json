Then\n\n-   $HK := \\{ h*k \\mid h \\in H,\\ k \\in K \\}$ is a subgroup of $G$,\n\n-   $K$ is a normal subgroup of $HK$,\n\n-   $H \\cap K$ is a normal subgroup of $H$,\n\n-   There is a natural group isomorphism $H/(H \\cap K) = HK/K$.\n\nThe same statement also holds in the category of modules over a fixed\nring (where normality is neither needed nor relevant), and indeed can be\nformulated so as to hold in any abelian category.",
