  "definition": "For a commutative ring $R$ having regular elements, we may form\n$T = S^{-1}R$, the [*total ring of fractions*]{} (quotients) of $R$, as\nthe localization of $R$ at $S$, where $S$ is the set of all\nnon-zero-divisors of $R$. Then, $T$ can be regarded as an extension ring\nof $R$ (similarly as the field of fractions of an integral domain is an\nextension ring). $T$ has the non-zero unity 1.",
