  "definition": "If $R$ is an infinite , the [*behavior*]{} of $R$ is a nonnegative\ninteger $k$ such that there exists a $r$ of the additive group of $R$\nwith $r^2=kr$.\n\nIf $R$ is a finite cyclic ring of order $n$, the [*behavior*]{} of $R$\nis a positive divisor $k$ of $n$ such that there exists a generator $r$\nof the additive group of $R$ with $r^2=kr$.\n\nFor any cyclic ring, behavior exists uniquely. Moreover, the behavior of\na cyclic ring determines many of its .\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this definition first appeared in my\nmaster\u2019s thesis:\n\nBuck, Warren. **.
