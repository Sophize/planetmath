  "statement": "**Theorem.** Let $O$ be the maximal order, i.e. the ring of integers of\nan algebraic number field. Then $O$ is a unique factorization domain if\nand only if $O$ is a principal ideal domain.\n\n[*Proof.*]{} $1^{\\underline{o}}$. Suppose that $O$ is a PID.\n\nWe first state, that any prime number $\\pi$ of $O$ generates a prime\nideal $(\\pi)$ of $O$. For if $(\\pi) = \\mathfrak{ab}$, then we have the\nprincipal ideals $\\mathfrak{a} = (\\alpha)$ and $\\mathfrak{b} = (\\beta)$.\nIt follows that $(\\pi) = (\\alpha\\beta)$, i.e. $\\pi = \\lambda\\alpha\\beta$\nwith some $\\lambda\\in O$, and since $\\pi$ is prime, one of $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ must be a unit of $O$. Thus one of $\\mathfrak{a}$ and\n$\\mathfrak{b}$ is the unit ideal $O$, and accordingly $(\\pi)$ is a\nmaximal ideal of $O$, so also a prime ideal.\n\nLet a non-zero element $\\gamma$ of $O$ be split to prime number factors\n$\\pi_i$, $\\varrho_j$ in two ways:\n$\\gamma = \\pi_1\\cdots\\pi_r = \\varrho_1\\cdots\\varrho_s$. Then also the\nprincipal ideal $(\\gamma)$ splits to principal prime ideals in two ways:\n$(\\gamma) = (\\pi_1)\\cdots(\\pi_r) = (\\varrho_1)\\cdots(\\varrho_s)$. Since\nthe prime factorization of ideals is unique, the\n$(\\pi_1),\\,\\ldots,\\,(\\pi_r)$ must be, up to the , identical with\n$(\\varrho_1),\\,\\ldots,\\,(\\varrho_s)$ (and $r = s$). Let\n$(\\pi_1) = (\\varrho_{j_1})$. Then $\\pi_1$ and $\\varrho_{j_1}$ are\nassociates of each other; the same may be said of all pairs\n$(\\pi_i,\\,\\varrho_{j_i})$. So we have seen that the factorization in $O$\nis unique.\n\n$2^{\\underline{o}}$. Suppose then that $O$ is a UFD.\n\nConsider any prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $O$. Let $\\alpha$ be a\nnon-zero element of $\\mathfrak{p}$ and let $\\alpha$ have the prime\nfactorization $\\pi_1\\cdots\\pi_n$. Because $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime\nideal and divides the ideal product $(\\pi_1)\\cdots(\\pi_n)$,\n$\\mathfrak{p}$ must divide one principal ideal $(\\pi_i) = (\\pi)$. This\nmeans that $\\pi \\in \\mathfrak{p}$. We write $(\\pi) = \\mathfrak{pa}$,\nwhence $\\pi\\in \\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\pi\\in \\mathfrak{a}$. Since $O$ is a\nDedekind domain, every its ideal can be generated by two elements, one\nof which may be chosen freely (see the two-generator property).\nTherefore we can write\n$$\\mathfrak{p} = (\\pi,\\,\\gamma),\\,\\,\\, \\mathfrak{a} = (\\pi,\\,\\delta).$$\nWe multiply these, getting\n$\\mathfrak{pa} = (\\pi^2,\\,\\pi\\gamma,\\,\\pi\\delta,\\,\\gamma\\delta)$, and so\n$\\gamma\\delta\\in \\mathfrak{pa} = (\\pi)$. Thus\n$\\gamma\\delta = \\lambda\\pi$ with some $\\lambda\\in O$. According to the\nunique factorization, we have $\\pi\\,|\\,\\gamma$ or $\\pi\\,|\\,\\delta$.\n\nThe latter alternative means that $\\delta = \\delta_1\\pi$ (with\n$\\delta_1\\in O$), whence\n$\\mathfrak{a} = (\\pi,\\,\\delta_1\\pi) = (\\pi)(1,\\,\\delta_1) = (\\pi)(1) = (\\pi)$;\nthus we had $\\mathfrak{pa} = (\\pi) = \\mathfrak{p}(\\pi)$ which would\nimply the absurdity $\\mathfrak{p} = (1)$. But the former alternative\nmeans that $\\gamma = \\gamma_1\\pi$ (with $\\gamma_1\\in O$), which shows\nthat\n$$\\mathfrak{p} = (\\pi,\\,\\gamma_1\\pi) = (\\pi)(1,\\,\\gamma_1) = (\\pi)(1) = (\\pi).$$\nIn other words, an arbitrary prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $O$ is\nprincipal. It follows that all ideals of $O$ are principal. Q.E.D.",
