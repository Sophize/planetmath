  "definition": "A (left or right) module $M$ over a ring $R$ is said to be *Noetherian*\nif the following equivalent conditions hold:\n\n1.  Every submodule of $M$ is finitely generated over $R$.\n\n2.  The ascending chain condition holds on submodules.\n\n3.  Every nonempty family of submodules has a maximal element.\n\nFor example, the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not Noetherian, as\nit is not finitely generated, but the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Z}$\nis Noetherian, as every submodule is generated by a single element.\n\nObserve that changing the ring can change whether a module is Noetherian\nor not: for example, the $\\mathbb{Q}$-module $\\mathbb{Q}$ is Noetherian,\nsince it is (has no nontrivial submodules).\n\nThere is also a notion of : a ring is left Noetherian if it is\nNoetherian as a left module over itself, and right Noetherian if it is\nNoetherian as a right module over itself. For non-commutative rings,\nthese two notions can differ.\n\nThe corresponding property for groups is usually called the maximal\ncondition.\n\nFinally, there is the somewhat related notion of a .",
