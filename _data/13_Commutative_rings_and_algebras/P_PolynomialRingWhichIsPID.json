(Cf. the\ncorollary 4 in the entry polynomial ring over a field.)\\\n[*Proof.*]{} Let $a$ be any non-zero element of $D$. Then the ideal\n$(a,\\,X)$ of $D[X]$ is a principal ideal $(f(X))$ with $f(X)$ a .\nTherefore, $$a \\;=\\; f(X)g(X), \\quad X \\;=\\; f(X)h(X)$$ with $g(X)$ and\n$h(X)$ certain polynomials in $D[X]$. From these equations one infers\nthat $f(X)$ is a polynomial $c$ and $h(X)$ is a first degree polynomial\n$b_0\\!+\\!b_1X$ ($b_1 \\neq 0$). Thus we obtain the equation\n$$cb_0+cb_1X \\;=\\; X,$$ which shows that $cb_1$ is the unity 1 of $D$.\nThus $c = f(X)$ is a unit of $D$, whence\n$$(a,\\,X) \\;=\\; (f(X)) \\;=\\; (1) \\;=\\; D[X].$$ So we can write\n$$1 \\;=\\; a\\!\\cdot\\!u(X)+X\\!\\cdot\\!v(X),$$ where $u(X),\\,v(X) \\in D[X]$.\nThis equation cannot be possible without that $a$ times the constant\nterm of $u(X)$ is the unity. Accordingly, $a$ has a multiplicative\ninverse in $D$. Because $a$ was arbitrary non-zero elenent of the\nintegral domain $D$, $D$ is a field.\n\n[9]{} : [*A first course in rings and ideals*]{}.
