  "statement": "Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring with $1$. Every ideal in $R$ is\n.\n\nThe theorem can be proved in two steps:\n\nEvery ideal in $R$ can be written as a finite intersection of\nirreducible ideals\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all ideals of a Noetherian ring $R$ which can not\nbe written as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. Suppose\n$S\\ne \\varnothing$. Then any chain $I_1\\subseteq I_2 \\subseteq \\cdots $\nin $S$ must terminate in a finite number of steps, as $R$ is Noetherian.\nSay $I=I_n$ is the maxmimal element of this chain. Since $I\\in S$, $I$\nitself can not be irreducible, so that $I=J\\cap K$ where $J$ and $K$ are\nideals strictly containing $I$. Now, if $J\\in S$, then then $I$ would\nnot be maximal in the chain $I_1\\subseteq I_2 \\subseteq \\cdots$.\nTherefore, $J\\notin S$. Similarly, $K\\notin S$. By the definition of\n$S$, $J$ and $K$ are both finite intersections of irreducible ideals.\nBut this would imply that $I\\notin S$, a contradiction. So\n$S=\\varnothing$ and we are done.\n\nEvery irreducible ideal in $R$ is primary\n\nSuppose $I$ is irreducible and $ab\\in I$. We want to show that either\n$a\\in I$, or some power $n$ of $b$ is in $I$. Define\n$J_i={I \\!:\\! (b^i)}$, the quotient of ideals $I$ and $(b^i)$. Since\n$$\\cdots \\subseteq (b^n)\\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq (b^2)\\subseteq (b),$$\nwe have, by one of the rules on quotients of ideals, an ascending chain\nof ideals\n$$J_1\\subseteq J_2 \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq J_n \\subseteq \\cdots$$\nSince $R$ is Noetherian, $J:=J_n=J_m$ for all $m>n$. Next, define\n$K=(b^n)+I$, the sum of ideals $(b^n)$ and $I$. We want to show that\n$I=J\\cap K$.\n\nFirst, it is clear that $I\\subseteq J$ and $I\\subseteq K$, which takes\ncare of one of the inclusions. Now, suppose $r\\in J\\cap K$. Then\n$r=s+tb^n$, where $s\\in I$ and $t\\in R$, and $rb^n\\in I$. So,\n$rb^n=sb^n+tb^{2n}$. Now, $t\\in {I \\!:\\! (b^{2n})}$, so\n$t\\in {I \\!:\\! (b^n)}$. But this means that $r=s+tb^n\\in I$, and this\nproves the other inclusion.\n\nSince $I$ is irreducible, either $I=J$ or $I=K$. We analyze the two\ncases below:\n\n-   If $I=J={I \\!:\\! (b^n)}$, then $I={I \\!:\\! (b)}$ in particular,\n    since $I\\subseteq {I \\!:\\! (b)} \\subseteq {I \\!:\\! (b^n)}$. As\n    $ab\\in I$ by assumption, $a\\in {I \\!:\\! (b)}= I$.\n\n-   If $I=K=(b^n)+I$, then $b^n\\in I$.\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The above theorem can be generalized to any submodule of a finitely\n    generated module over a commutative Noetherian ring with 1.\n\n-   A ring is said to be *Lasker* if every ideal is decomposable. The\n    theorem above says that every commutative Noetherian ring with 1 is\n    Lasker. There are Lasker rings that are not Noetherian.",
