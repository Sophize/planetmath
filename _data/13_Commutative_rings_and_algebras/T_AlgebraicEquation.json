  "definition": "The equation $$f(x_1,\\,x_2,\\,...,\\,x_m) = 0,$$ where the left hand is a\npolynomial in $x_1$, $x_2$, \u2026, $x_m$ with coefficients in a certain\nfield, is called an [*algebraic equation*]{} over that field. Often the\nfield in question is $\\mathbb{Q}$; then the coefficients may be assumed\nto be integers.\n\nBy the [*degree*]{} of an algebraic equation is meant the degree of the\npolynomial.\n\nE.g. $3x^2-1 = 0$ and $x^3+x^2y+xy^2+y^3 = 0$ are algebraic equations\nover the field $\\mathbb{Q}$, the degrees of which are 2 and 3.",
