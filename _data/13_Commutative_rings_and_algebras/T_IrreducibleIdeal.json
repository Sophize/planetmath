  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. An ideal $I$ in $R$ is said to be if, whenever $I$ is\nan intersection of two ideals: $I=J\\cap K$, then either $I=J$ or $I=K$.\n\nIrreducible ideals are closely related to the notions of irreducible\nelements in a ring. In fact, the following holds:\n\nIf $D$ is a gcd domain, and $x$ is an irreducible element, then $I=(x)$\nis an irreducible ideal.\n\nIf $x$ is a unit, then $I=D$ and we are done. So we assume that $x$ is\nnot a unit for the remainder of the proof.\n\nLet $I = J\\cap K$ and suppose $a\\in J-I$ and $b\\in K-I$. Then $ab=x^n$\nfor some $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $c$ be a gcd of $a$ and $x$. So $$cd=x$$\nfor some $d\\in D$. Since $x$ is irreducible, either $c$ is a unit or $d$\nis. The proof now breaks down into two cases:\n\n-   $c$ is a unit. Let $t$ be a lcm of $a$ and $x$. Then $tc$ is an\n    associate of $ax$. But $c$ is a unit, $t$ and $ax$ are associates,\n    so that $ax$ is a lcm of $a$ and $x$. As $ab=x^n$, both $a\\mid ab$\n    and $x\\mid ab$ hold, which imply that $ax\\mid ab$. Write $axr=ab$,\n    where $r\\in D$. Then $b=xr\\in I$, which is impossible by assumption.\n\n-   $d$ is a unit. So $c$ is an associate of $x$. Because $c$ divides\n    $a$, we get that $x\\mid a$ as well, or $a\\in I$, which is again\n    impossible by assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that $J-I\\ne \\varnothing$ and\n$K-I\\ne \\varnothing$ is false, which is the same as saying\n$J\\subseteq I$ or $K\\subseteq I$. But $I\\subseteq J$ and $I\\subseteq K$,\neither $I=J$ or $I=K$, or $I$ is irreducible.\n\n**Remark**. In a commutative Noetherian ring, the notion of an\nirreducible ideal can be used to prove the Lasker-Noether theorem: every\nideal (in a Noetherian ring) has a primary decomposition.\n\n[9]{} D.G.
