  "statement": "The criterion for a non-empty subset $R$ of a given ring $Q$ for being a\nsubring of $Q$, is that $R$ contains always along with its two elements\nalso their difference and product. Since the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the\nrational numbers is (isomorphic to) the total ring of quotients of the\nring $\\mathbb{Z}$ of the integers, any rational number is a quotient\n$\\displaystyle\\frac{m}{n}$ of two integers $m$ and $n$. If now $R$ is an\narbitrary subring of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and\n$$\\frac{m_1}{n_1},\\, \\frac{m_2}{n_2} \\in R$$ with\n$m_1,\\,n_1,\\,m_2,\\,n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (and $n_1n_2 \\neq 0$), then one\nmust have\n$$\\frac{m_1n_2-m_2n_1}{n_1n_2} \\in R, \\qquad \\frac{m_1m_2}{n_1n_2} \\in R.$$\nTherefore, the set of possible denominators of the elements of $R$ is\nclosed under multiplication, i.e. it forms a multiplicative set. We can\nof course confine us to subsets $S$ containing only positive integers.\nBut along with any positive integer $n_0$, the set $S$ has to contain\nalso all positive , inclusive 1 and the of the number $n_0$, since the\nfactorisation $n_0 = uv$ of the denominator of an element\n$\\displaystyle\\frac{m}{n_0}$ of $R$ implies that the\n$\\displaystyle u\\cdot\\frac{m}{uv} = \\frac{m}{v}$ belongs to $R$.\nAccordingly, $S$ consists of 1, a certain set of positive prime numbers\nand all finite products of these, thus being a free monoid on the set of\nthose prime numbers.\n\nSince $R$ contains all of each of its elements, it is apparent that the\nset of possible numerators form an ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n$\\therefore$ **Theorem.** If $R$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{Q}$, then\nthere are a principal ideal $(k)$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and a multiplicative\nsubset $S$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $S$ is a free monoid on certain set\nof prime numbers and any element $\\displaystyle\\frac{m}{n}$ of $R$ is\ncharacterised by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{cases}\nm \\in (k),\\\\\nn \\in S.\n\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$ The positive generator $k$ of $(k)$ does not\nbelong to $S$ except when it is 1.\\\n**Note.** Since $k$ may be greater than 1, the ring $R$ is not\nnecessarily the ring of quotients $S^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}$, e.g. in the case\n$$R = \\left\\{\\frac{2a}{3^s}\\,\\vdots\\;\\; a \\in \\mathbb{Z},\\;\\, s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+\\right\\}.\\\\$$\n\n**Examples.**\\\n1. The ring $R := S^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}$ of the [**]{} where\\\n$S = \\{\\mathrm{the\\;power\\;products\\;of\\;all\\;positive\\;primes\\;except\\;} p\\}$.\nE.g. the 2-integral rational numbers consist of fractions with arbitrary\ninteger numerators and odd denominators, for example\n$\\frac{1000}{1001}$.\\\n2. The ring $R := S^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}$ of the decimal fractions where\n$S = \\{\\mathrm{the\\;power\\;products\\;of\\;2\\;and\\;5}\\}$.\\\n3. The ring of the or [*dyadic fractions*]{} with any integer numerators\nbut denominators from the set $S = \\{1,\\,2,\\,4,\\,8,\\,\\ldots\\}$.\\\n4. If $S = \\{1\\}$, the subring of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is simply some ideal\n$(k)$ of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}$.\\\nAll the subrings of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (except the trivial ring $\\{0\\}$) have\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ as their total ring of quotients.",
