  "statement": "Every Principal Ideal Domain (PID) is a Unique Factorization Domain\n(UFD).\n\nThe first step of the proof shows that any PID is a Noetherian ring in\nwhich every irreducible is prime. The second step is to show that any\nNoetherian ring in which every irreducible is prime is a UFD.\n\nWe will need the following\n\nEvery PID $R$ is a gcd domain. Any two gcd\u2019s of a pair of elements $a,b$\nare associates of each other.\n\nSuppose $a,b\\in R$. Consider the ideal generated by $a$ and $b$,\n$(a,b)$. Since $R$ is a PID, there is an element $d\\in R$ such that\n$(a,b)=(d)$. But $a,b\\in(a,b)$, so $d\\mid a, d\\mid b$. So $d$ is a\ncommon divisor of $a$ and $b$. Now suppose $c\\mid a, c\\mid b$. Then\n$(d)=(a,b)\\subset (c)$ and hence $c\\mid d$.\n\nThe second part of the lemma follows since if $c,d$ are two such gcd\u2019s,\nthen $(c)=(a,b)=(d)$, so $c\\mid d$ and $d\\mid c$ so that $c,d$ are\nassociates.\n\nIf $R$ is a PID, then $R$ is Noetherian and every irreducible element of\n$R$ is prime.\n\nLet $I_1\\subset I_2\\subset I_3\\subset \\ldots$ be a chain of (principal)\nideals in $R$. Then $I_\\infty = \\cup_k I_k$ is also an ideal. Since $R$\nis a PID, there is $a\\in R$ such that $I_\\infty=(a)$, and thus\n$a\\in I_n$ for some $n$. Then for each $m>n$, $I_m=I_n$. So $R$\nsatisfies the ascending chain condition and thus is Noetherian.\n\nTo show that each irreducible in $R$ is prime, choose some irreducible\n$a\\in R$, and suppose $a=bc$. Let $d=\\gcd(a,b)$. Now, $d\\mid a$, but $a$\nis irreducible. Thus either $d$ is a unit, or $d$ is an associate of\n$a$. If $d$ is an associate of $a$, then $a\\mid d\\mid b$ so that\n$a\\mid b$ and $c$ is a unit. If $d$ is itself a unit, then we can assume\nby the lemma that $d=1$. Then $1\\in(a,b)$ so that there are $x,y\\in R$\nsuch that $xa+yb=1$. Multiplying through by $c$, we see that\n$xac+ybc=c$. But $a\\mid xac$ and $a\\mid ybc=ya$. Thus $a\\mid c$ so that\n$b$ is a unit. In either case, $a$ is prime.\n\nIf $R$ is Noetherian, and if every irreducible element of $R$ is prime,\nthen $R$ is a UFD.\n\nWe show that any nonzero nonunit is $R$ is expressible as a product of\nirreducibles (and hence as a product of primes), and then show that the\nfactorization is unique.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{U}\\subset R$ be the set of ideals generated by each\nelement of $R$ that cannot be written as a product of irreducible\nelements of $R$. If $\\mathcal{U}\\neq\\emptyset$, then $\\mathcal{U}$ has a\nmaximal element $(r)$ since $R$ is Noetherian. $r$ is not irreducible by\nconstruction and thus not prime, so $(r)$ is not prime and thus not\nmaximal. So there is a proper maximal ideal $(s)$ with\n$(r)\\subsetneq (s)$, and $s\\mid r$.\n\nSince $(r)$ is maximal in $\\mathcal{U}$, it follows that\n$(s)\\notin \\mathcal{U}$ and thus that $s$ is a product of irreducibles.\nChoose some irreducible $a\\mid s$; then $a\\mid r$ and $$r=ab$$ for some\n$b\\in R$. If $(b)\\notin \\mathcal{U}$ (note that this includes the case\nwhere $b$ is a unit), then $b$ and hence $r$ is a product of\nirreducibles, a contradiction. If $(b)\\in \\mathcal{U}$ then\n$(r)\\subset (b)$ (since $b\\mid r$). $(r)\\neq (b)$ since $a$ is not a\nunit, and thus $(r)\\subsetneq (b)$. This contradicts the presumed\nmaximality of $(r)$ in $\\mathcal{U}$. Thus $\\mathcal{U}=\\emptyset$ and\neach element of $R$ can be written as a product of irreducibles\n(primes).\n\nThe proof of uniqueness is identical to the standard proof for the\nintegers. Suppose\n$$a = p_1\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n = q_1\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot q_m$$ where the\n$p_i$ and $q_j$ are primes. Then $p_1\\mid q_1\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot q_m$;\nsince $p_1$ is prime, it must divide some $q_j$. Reordering if\nnecessary, assume $j=1$. Then $p_1=u\\cdot q_1$ where $u$ is a unit.\nFactoring out these terms since $R$ is a domain, we get\n$$p_2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot p_n=u\\cdot q_2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot q_m$$ We may\ncontinue the process, matching prime factors from the two sides.",
