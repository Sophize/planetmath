Since, for every $s \\in R$, $|s|$ divides $|R|$, then it\nfollows that $\\operatorname{char}~R=|R|$. Conversely, if $R$ is a finite\nring such that $\\operatorname{char}~R=|R|$, then the exponent of the\nadditive group of $R$ is also equal to $|R|$. Thus, there exists\n$t \\in R$ such that $|t|=|R|$. Since $\\langle t \\rangle$ is a subgroup\nof the additive group of $R$ and $|\\langle t \\rangle |=|t|=|R|$, it\nfollows that $R$ is a cyclic ring.",
