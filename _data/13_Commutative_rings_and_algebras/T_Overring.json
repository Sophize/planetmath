  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring having regular elements and let $T$ be the\ntotal ring of fractions of $R$. Then $R \\subseteq T$. Every subring of\n$T$ containing $R$ is an [*overring*]{} of $R$.\\\n**Example.** Let $p$ be a rational prime number. The are the quotients\nof two integers such that the is not divisible by $p$. The set of all\n$p$-integral rationals is an overring of $\\mathbb{Z}$.",
