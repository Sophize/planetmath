  "definition": "An integral domain $D$ is a *pre-Schreier domain* if every non-zero\nelement of $D$ is primal. If in addition $D$ is integrally closed, then\n$D$ is called a *Schreier domain*.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  Every irreducible element of a pre-Schreier domain is prime.\n\n2.  A gcd domain is a Schreier domain (a proof of this can be found ).",
