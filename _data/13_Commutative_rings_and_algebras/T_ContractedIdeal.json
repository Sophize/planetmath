  "definition": "Let $f: A \\to B$ be a ring homomorphism. Let $\\mathfrak{b}$ be an ideal\nin $B$. Then it is easy to show that the inverse image of\n$\\mathfrak{b}$, that is $f^{-1}(\\mathfrak{b})$, is an ideal in $A$, and\nwe call it a [*contracted ideal*]{}. A common notation for the\ncontracted ideal in this case is $\\mathfrak{b}^c$.",
