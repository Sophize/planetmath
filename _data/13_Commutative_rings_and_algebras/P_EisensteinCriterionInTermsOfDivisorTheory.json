If there is a prime divisor\n$\\mathfrak{p \\in D}$ such that\n\n-   $\\mathfrak{p} \\mid a_0,\\,a_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_{n-1},$\n\n-   $\\mathfrak{p} \\nmid a_n,$\n\n-   $\\mathfrak{p}^2 \\nmid a_0,$\n\nthen the polynomial is irreducible.\\\n\n[*Proof.*]{} Suppose that we have in $\\mathcal{O}[x]$ the factorisation\n$$f(x) = (b_0+b_1x+\\ldots+b_sx^s)(c_0+c_1x+\\ldots+c_tx^t)$$ with $s > 0$\nand $t > 0$. Because the principal divisor $(a_0)$, i.e. $(b_0)(c_0)$ is\ndivisible by the prime divisor $\\mathfrak{p}$ and there is a unique\nfactorisation in the monoid $\\mathfrak{D}$, $\\mathfrak{p}$ must divide\n$(b_0)$ or $(c_0)$ but, by $\\mathfrak{p}^2 \\nmid (a_0)$, not both of\n$(b_0)$ and $(c_0)$; suppose e.g. that $\\mathfrak{p} \\mid c_0$. If\n$\\mathfrak{p}$ would divide all the coefficients $c_j$, then it would\ndivide also the product $b_sc_t = a_n$. So, there is a certain smallest\nindex $k$ such that $p \\nmid c_k$. Accordingly, in the sum\n$b_0c_k+b_1c_{k-1}+\\ldots+b_kc_0$, the prime divisor $\\mathfrak{p}$\nevery summand except the first (see the definition of ); therefore it\ncannot divide the sum. But the value of the sum is $a_k$ which by\nhypothesis is divisible by the prime divisor. This contradiction shows\nthat the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible.",
