  "statement": "**Proposition.** Assume that $R$ is a commutative ring and\n$I\\subseteq R$ is an ideal, such that the radical $r(I)$ of $I$ is a\nmaximal ideal. Then $I$ is a primary ideal.\n\n*Proof.* We will show, that every zero divisor in $R/I$ is nilpotent\n(please, see parent object for details).\n\nFirst of all, recall that $r(I)$ is an intersection of all prime ideals\ncontaining $I$ (please, see for more details). Since $r(I)$ is maximal,\nit follows that there is exactly one prime ideal $P=r(I)$ such that\n$I\\subseteq P$. In particular the ring $R/I$ has only one prime ideal\n(because there is one-to-one correspondence between prime ideals in\n$R/I$ and prime ideals in $R$ containing $I$). Thus, in $R/I$ an ideal\n$r(0)$ is prime.\n\nNow assume that $\\alpha\\in R/I$ is a zero divisor. In particular\n$\\alpha\\neq 0+I$ and for some $\\beta\\neq 0+I \\in R/I$ we have\n$$\\alpha\\beta=0+I.$$ But $0+I\\in r(0)$ and $r(0)$ is prime. This shows,\nthat either $\\alpha\\in r(0)$ or $\\beta\\in r(0)$.\n\nObviously $\\alpha\\in r(0)$ (and $\\beta\\in r(0)$), because $r(0)$ is the\nonly maximal ideal in $R/I$ (the ring $R/I$ is local). Therefore\nelements not belonging to $r(0)$ are invertible, but $\\alpha$ cannot be\ninvertible, because it is a zero divisor.\n\nOn the other hand\n$r(0)=\\{x+I\\in R/I\\ |\\ (x+I)^n=0\\mbox{ for some }n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nTherefore $\\alpha$ is nilpotent and this completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Corollary.** Let $p\\in\\mathbb{N}$ be a prime number and\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Then the ideal $(p^n)\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}$ is primary.\n\n*Proof.* Of course the ideal $(p)$ is maximal and we have\n$$r\\big((p^n)\\big)=r\\big((p)^n\\big)=(p),$$ since for any prime ideal $P$\n(in arbitrary ring $R$) we have $r(P^n)=P$. The result follows from the\nproposition. $\\square$",
