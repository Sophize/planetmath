If $I$ is any ideal of $R$, then by the Weak\nApproximation Theorem we can choose $x\\in R$ such that\n$\\nu_{{\\mathfrak{p}}_i}((x))=\\nu_{{\\mathfrak{p}}_i}(I)$ for all $i$\n(where $\\nu_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ is the ${\\mathfrak{p}}$-adic valuation).\nBut since $R$ is Dedekind, ideals have unique factorization; since $(x)$\nand $I$ have identical factorizations, we must have $(x)=I$ and $I$ is\nprincipal.",
