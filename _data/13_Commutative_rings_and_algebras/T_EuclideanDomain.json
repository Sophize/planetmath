  "definition": "A *Euclidean domain* is an integral domain on which a Euclidean\nvaluation can be defined.\n\nEvery Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain, and therefore also a\nunique factorization domain.\n\nAny two elements of a Euclidean domain have a greatest common divisor,\nwhich can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nAn example of a Euclidean domain is the ring ${\\mathbb{Z}}$. Another\nexample is the polynomial ring $F[x]$, where $F$ is any field. Every\nfield is also a Euclidean domain.",
