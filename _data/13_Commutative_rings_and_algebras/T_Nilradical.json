  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring. An element $x \\in R$ is said to be\n[*nilpotent*]{} if $x^n = 0$ for some positive integer $n$. The set of\nall nilpotent elements of $R$ is an ideal of $R$, called the\n[*nilradical*]{} of $R$ and denoted $\\operatorname{Nil}(R)$. The\nnilradical is so named because it is the radical of the zero ideal.\n\nThe nilradical of $R$ equals the prime radical of $R$, although proving\nthat the two are equivalent requires the axiom of choice.",
