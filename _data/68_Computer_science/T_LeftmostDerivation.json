  "definition": "Let $G=(\\Sigma, N, P, \\sigma)$ be a context-free grammar. Recall that a\nword $v$ is generated by $G$ if it is\n\n-   a word over the set $T:=\\Sigma - N$ of terminals, and\n\n-   derivable from the starting symbol $\\sigma$.\n\nThe second condition simply says that there is a finite sequence of\nderivation steps, starting from $\\sigma$, and ending at $v$:\n$$\\sigma = v_0 \\to v_1 \\to \\cdots \\to v_n = v$$ For each derivation step\n$v_i\\to v_{i+1}$, there is a production $X\\to w$ in $P$ such that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nv_i &=& aXb, \\\\\nv_{i+1} &=& awb.\\end{aligned}$$ Note that $X$ is a non-terminal (an\nelement of $N$), and $a,b,w$ are words over $\\Sigma$.\n\n**Definition**. Using the notations above, if $X$ is the leftmost\nnon-terminal occurring in $v_i$, then we say the derivation step\n$v_i\\to v_{i+1}$ is *leftmost*. Dually, $v_i\\to v_{i+1}$ is *rightmost*\nif $X$ is the rightmost non-terminal occurring in $v_i$.\n\nEquivalently, $v_i\\to v_{i+1}$ is leftmost (or rightmost) if $a$ (or\n$b$) is a word over $T$.\n\nA derivation is said to be *leftmost* (or *rightmost*) if each of its\nderivation steps is leftmost (or rightmost).\n\n**Example**. Let $G$ be the grammar consisting of $a,b$ as terminals,\n$\\sigma,X,Y,Z$ as non-terminals (with $\\sigma$ as the starting symbol),\nand $\\sigma \\to XY$, $X\\to a$, $Y\\to b$, $\\sigma \\to ZY$, and\n$Z\\to X\\sigma$ as productions. $G$ is clearly context-free.\n\nThe word $a^2b^2=aabb$ can be generated by $G$ by the following three\nderivations:\n\n1.  $\\sigma \\to ZY \\to X\\sigma Y \\to XXYY \\to XaYY \\to XaYb \\to Xabb \\to aabb$,\n\n2.  $\\sigma \\to ZY \\to X\\sigma Y \\to a \\sigma Y \\to a XYY \\to aaYY \\to aabY \\to aabb$,\n\n3.  $\\sigma \\to ZY \\to Zb \\to X\\sigma b \\to XXY b\\to XXbb \\to Xabb \\to aabb$.\n\nThe second is leftmost, the third is rightmost, and the first is\nneither.\n\nNote that in every derivation, the first and last derivation steps are\nalways leftmost and rightmost.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   One of the main properties of a context-free grammar $G$ is that\n    every word generated by $G$ is derivable by a leftmost\n    (correspondingly rightmost) derivation, which can be used to show\n    that for every context-free language $L$, there is a pushdown\n    automaton accepting every word in $L$, and conversely that the set\n    of words accepted by a pushdown automaton is context-free.\n\n-   Leftmost derivations may be defined for any arbitrary formal grammar\n    $G$ satisfying the condition\n\n    > (\\*) no terminal symbols occur on the left side of any production.\n\n    Given two words $u,v$, we define $u\\Rightarrow_L v$ if there is a\n    production $A\\to B$ such that $u=xAy$ and $v=xBy$ such that $x$ is a\n    terminal word. By taking the reflexive transitive closure of\n    $\\Rightarrow_L$, we have the leftmost derivation $\\Rightarrow_L^*$.\n    It can be shown that for any grammar $G$ satisfying condition (\\*),\n    the language $L_L(G)$ consisting of terminal words generated by $G$\n    via leftmost derivations is always context-free.\n\n[9]{} S.
