  "definition": "A *search tree* is a tree where every subtree of a node has keys less\nthan any other subtree of the node to its right. The keys in a node are\nconceptually between subtrees and are greater than any keys in subtrees\nto its left and less than any keys in subtrees to its right.\n\nA search might visit nodes in the tree to locate some information. At\nthe outset of the search one has a given key and seeks to find the node\nin the tree having that key. As the nodes are visited a comparison of\nthe node\u2019s key to the given key is made and a decision to go to either\nthe left subtree or the right subtree is made. Knowing that all keys to\nthe left (right) are smaller (larger) makes the search easy to carry\nout.",
