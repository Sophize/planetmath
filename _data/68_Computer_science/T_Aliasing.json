  "definition": "[**Aliasing**]{}\n\nUsed in the context of processing digitized signals (e.g. audio) and\nimages (e.g. video), aliasing describes the effect of undersampling\nduring digitization which can generate a false (apparent) low frequency\nfor signals, or staircase steps along edges in images (jaggies.)\nAliasing can be avoided by an antialiasing (analogue) low-pass filter,\nbefore sampling. The term antialiasing is also in use for *a posteriori*\nsignal smoothing intended to remove the effect.\n\n[**References**]{}\n\n-   Based on content from The Data Analysis Briefbook ()",
