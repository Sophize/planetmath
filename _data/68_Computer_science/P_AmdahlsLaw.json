  "statement": "Amdahl\u2019s Law reveals the maximum speedup that can be expected from\nparallel algorithms given the proportion of parts that must be computed\nsequentially. It gives the speedup $S$ as\n\n$$S \\le \\frac{1}{f+(1-f)/N}$$\n\nWhere $f$ is the fraction of the problem that must be computed\nsequentially and $N$ is the number of processors.\n\nNote that as $f$ approaches zero, $S$ nears $N$, which we\u2019d expect from\na perfectly parallelizable algorithm.",
