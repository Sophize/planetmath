  "definition": "A language is *definite* if the determination of whether a word belongs\nto the language completely depends on its suffix of a fixed length.\nFormally,\n\n**Definition**. Let $L$ be a language over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. Then\n$L$ is *definite* if there is a non-negative integer $k$ such that for\nany word $u$ over $\\Sigma$ with $|u|\\ge k$, its suffix $v$ of length $k$\nis in $L$ iff $u$ is in $L$.\n\nNote that if $k=0$, then $L$ is either $\\Sigma^*$ or $\\varnothing$.\n\nA definite language has the following characterization:\n\n$L$ is definite iff there are finite languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ such that\n$$L=L_1\\cup \\Sigma^* L_2.$$\n\nSuppose first that $L$ is definite. Let $L_1$ be the subset of $L$\ncontaining all words with length less than $k$ and $L_2$ the subset of\n$L$ containing all words of length $k$. The case when $k=0$ is already\nmentioned in the note above. If $k=1$, $L_1$ is either\n$\\lbrace \\lambda \\rbrace$ or $\\varnothing$, depending on whether or not\n$\\lambda\\in L$. In any case, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are both finite. We verify\nthat $L=L_1\\cup \\Sigma^*L_2$. If $u\\in L$ and $u$ has length less than\n$k$, then $u\\in L_1$. Otherwise, it has length at least $k$. By the\ndefiniteness of $L$, its suffix $v$ of length $k$ is in $L$, and thus is\nin $L_2$. Therefore $u\\in \\Sigma^*L_2$ as a result. This shows that\n$L\\subseteq L_1\\cup \\Sigma^*L_2$. On the other hand, suppose\n$u \\in L_1\\cup \\Sigma^*L_2$. If $|u|<k$, then $u\\in L_1 \\subseteq L$. If\n$|u|\\ge k$, write $u=wv$ where $v$ is the suffix with length $k$. Then\n$v\\in L_2$, which means that $u\\in L$ since $L$ is definite.\n\nNow suppose $L=L_1\\cup \\Sigma^* L_2$ with $L_1,L_2$ finite. Let $k$ be\nthe maximum of lengths of words in $L_1\\cup L_2$, plus $1$. $k$ is\nwell-defined since $L_1\\cup L_2$ is finite. Suppose $u$ is a word in\n$\\Sigma^*$ with $|u|\\ge k$. Then $u\\notin L_1$. Let $v$ be the suffix of\n$u$ with $|v|=k$. Then $v\\notin L_1$ likewise. If $v\\in L$, then\n$v\\in \\Sigma^*L_2$ and hence $u\\in \\Sigma^*L_2$ as well. If $u\\in L$,\nthen $u\\in \\Sigma^*L_2$, so that $u$ has a suffix $w\\in L_2$. Since\n$|w|<k$, $w$ is also a suffix of $v$, and therefore\n$v\\in \\Sigma^*L_2 \\subseteq L$ as a result. This shows that $L$ is\ndefinite.\n\nFrom this characterization, we see that finite languages are special\ncases of definite languages. We also see that\n\nEvery definite language is a regular language.\n\nWith regard to the closure properties of definite languages, we have the\nfollowing: let $\\mathscr{D}$ be the family of definite languages, then\n$\\mathscr{D}$ is closed under union and complementation, and therefore\nany Boolean operations. However, $\\mathscr{D}$ is not closed under\nconcatenation, Kleene star, and reversal.\n\n**Remark**. In fact, every definite language is locally testable. The\nconverse, however, is not true.\n\n[9]{} A. Salomaa, [*Formal Languages*]{}, Academic Press, New York\n(1973).",
