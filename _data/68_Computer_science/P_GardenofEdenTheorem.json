  "statement": "Edward F. Moore\u2019s Garden-of-Eden theorem was the first rigorous\nstatement of cellular automata theory. Though originally stated for\ncellular automata on the plane, it works in arbitrary dimension.\n\n\\[thm:mo\\] Let $\\Acal = \\langle Q, \\Neigh, f \\rangle$ be a cellular\nautomaton on ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}}^d$ with finitely many states. If\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$ has two mutually erasable patterns, then it\nhas an orphan pattern.\n\nIn other words, surjective $d$-dimensional cellular automata are\npre-injective.\n\nThe same year, John Myhill proved the converse implication.\n\n\\[thm:my\\] Let $\\Acal = \\langle Q, \\Neigh, f \\rangle$ be a cellular\nautomaton on ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}}^d$ with finitely many states. If\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$ has an orphan pattern, then it has two\nmutually erasable patterns.\n\nIn other words, pre-injective $d$-dimensional cellular automata are\nsurjective.\n\nAn injective $d$-dimensional cellular automaton is surjective.\n\nTheorems\u00a0\\[thm:mo\\] and\u00a0\\[thm:my\\] hold because of the following\nstatement.\n\n\\[lem:mo\\] Let $a > 0$, $d \\geq 1$, $r \\geq 1$, $k \\geq 1$. For every\nsufficiently large $n$, $$\\label{eq:mo}\n(a^{k^d}-1)^{n^d} < a^{(kn-2r)^d}$$\n\nObserve that, if $a = |Q|$ and $$\\label{eq:Dr}\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{N}}}= \\{ x \\in {\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{Z}}}^d \\mid |x_i| \\leq r \\, \\forall i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,d\\} \\}\n\\;,$$ then $(a^{kn})^d$ is the number of possible hypercubic patterns of\nside $kn$, while $(a^{kn-2r})^d$ is the maximum number of their images\nvia $f$.\n\n*Proof.* The inequality (\\[eq:mo\\]) is in fact satisfied precisely by\nthose $n$ that satisfy\n$$\\log_a (a^{k^d}-1) < \\left( k - \\frac{2r}{n} \\right)^d \\;,$$ which is\ntrue for $n$ large enough since $\\log_a (a^{k^d}-1) < k^d$ while\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (k - 2r/n)^d = k^d.$ $\\Box$\n\nFor the rest of this entry, we will suppose that the neighborhood index\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{N}}}$ has the form (\\[eq:Dr\\]).\n\n*Proof of Moore\u2019s theorem.* Suppose ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$ has two\nmutually erasable patterns $p_1$, $p_2$: it is not restrictive to\nsuppose that their common support is a $d$-hypercube of side $k$. Define\nan equivalence relation $\\rho$ on patterns of side $n$ by stating that\n$p \\rho q$ if and only if $f(p) = f(q)$: since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are\nmutually erasable, $\\rho$ has at most $|Q|^{k^d}-1$ equivalence classes.\n\nBy the same criterion, we define a family $\\{\\rho_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$of\nequivalence relations between hypercubic patterns of side $kn$. Each\nsuch pattern can be subdivided into $n^d$ subpatterns of side $k$: and\nit is clear that, if two patterns are in relation $\\rho_n$, then each of\nthose subpatterns is in relation $\\rho$.\n\nBut then, the relation $\\rho_n$ cannot have more than\n$(|Q|^{k^d}-1)^{n^d}$ equivalence classes: consequently, at most\n$(|Q|^{k^d}-1)^{n^d}$ patterns of side $kn-2r$ can have a preimage. By\nLemma\u00a0\\[lem:mo\\] with $a=|Q|$, for $n$ large enough, some patterns of\nside $kn-2r$ must be orphan. $\\Box$\n\n*Proof of Myhill\u2019s theorem.* Let $p$ be an orphan pattern for\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$. Again, it is not restrictive to suppose\nthat the support of $p$ is a hypercube of side $k$. For $n \\geq 1$ let\n$\\nu_n$ be the number of patterns of side $kn$ that are *not* orphan.\nSplit each pattern of side $kn$ into $n^d$ patterns of side $k$, as we\ndid before. Then $\\nu_n$ cannot exceed the number of those that do not\ncontain a copy of $p$, which in turn is at most $(|Q|^{k^d}-1)^{n^d}$.\n\nTake $n$ so large that (\\[eq:mo\\]) is satisfied: for a fixed state\n$q_0 \\in Q$, and for $q_1 = f(q_0,\\ldots,q_0)$, there are more\nconfigurations that take value $q_0$ outside the hypercube\n$\\{0,\\ldots,kn-2r-1\\}^d$ than there are configurations that take value\n$q_1$ outside the hypercube $\\{-r,\\ldots,kn-1\\}^d$ and are not Gardens\nof Eden. As the configurations of the second type are the images of\nthose the first type, there must be two with the same image: those\nconfigurations correspond to two mutually erasable patterns. $\\Box$\n\nTheorems\u00a0\\[thm:mo\\] and \u00a0\\[thm:my\\] have been shown\u00a0[@csms99] to hold\nfor cellular automata on amenable groups.
