  "definition": "Let $\\mathscr{R}$ and $\\mathscr{GR}$ be the families of languages\nrepresented by regular expressions and generalized regular expressions\nrespectively. It is well-known that $$\\mathscr{R}=\\mathscr{GR}.$$ This\nmeans that the additional symbols $\\cap$ and $\\neg$ in a generalized\nregular expressions are extraneous: removing them will not affect the\nrepresentational power of the expressions with respect to regular\nlanguages.\n\nWhat if we remove $^*$, the Kleene star symbol, instead? With regard to\nregular expressions, removing $^*$ severely limits the power of the\nexpressions. By induction, the represented languages are all finite. In\nthis entry, we briefly discuss what happens when $^*$ is removed from\nthe generalized regular expressions.\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\Sigma$ be an alphabet. A language $L$ over\n$\\Sigma$ is said to be *star-free* if it can be expressed by a\ngeneralized regular expression without $^*$. In other words, a star-free\nlanguage is a language that can be obtained by applying the operations\nof union, concatenation, and complementation to $\\varnothing$ and atomic\nlanguages (singleton subsets of $\\Sigma$) a finite number of times.\n\nIf we denote $\\mathscr{SF}$ the family of star-free languages (over some\nalphabet $\\Sigma$), then $\\mathscr{SF}$ is the smallest set of languages\nover $\\Sigma$ such that\n\n-   $\\varnothing\\in \\mathscr{SF}$,\n\n-   $\\lbrace a\\rbrace \\in \\mathscr{SF}$ for any $a\\in \\Sigma$,\n\n-   if $L,M \\in \\mathscr{SF}$, then $L\\cup M, LM, L^c \\in \\mathscr{SF}$.\n\nA shorter characterization of a star-free language is a language with\nstar height $0$ with respect to representations by generalized regular\nexpressions.\n\nIn relations to finite and regular languages, we have the following:\n$$\\mathscr{F}\\subseteq \\mathscr{SF} \\subseteq \\mathscr{R},$$ where\n$\\mathscr{F}$ denotes the family of finite languages over $\\Sigma$.\n\nFurthermore, it is easy to see that $\\mathscr{SF}$ is closed under\nBoolean operations, so that $\\mathscr{SF}$ contains infinite languages,\nfor example $\\neg \\varnothing$ represents $\\Sigma^*$. As a result, the\nfirst inclusion must be strict. This example also shows that languages\nrepresentable by expressions including the Kleene star may still be\nstar-free. Here\u2019s another example: $\\lbrace ab \\rbrace^*$ over the\nalphabet $\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$. This language can be represented as\n$$\\lambda \\cup ( ab \\Sigma^* \\cap \\Sigma^* ab \\cap \\neg (\\Sigma^* a^2 \\Sigma^*) \\cap \\neg (\\Sigma^* b^2 \\Sigma^*))$$\nThe expression above, of course, is not star-free, and includes the\nsymbol $\\lambda$ representing the empty word. However, $\\Sigma^*$ is\njust $\\neg \\varnothing$, and $\\lambda$ is just\n$\\Sigma^* \\cap \\neg(a\\Sigma^*) \\cap \\neg(b\\Sigma^*)$. Some substitutions\nshow that $\\lbrace ab\\rbrace^*$ is indeed star-free.\n\nIs the second inclusion strict? Are there regular languages such that\nrepresentations by expressions including the Kleene star is inevitable?\nThe following proposition answers the question:\n\nA language $L$ is star-free iff there exists a non-negative integer $n$\nsuch that, for any words $u,v,w$ over $\\Sigma$, $uv^nw\\in L$ iff\n$uv^{n+1}w\\in L$.\n\nA language satisfying the second statement in the proposition is known\nas *noncounting*, so the proposition can be restated as: a language is\nstar-free iff it is noncounting.\n\nAs a result of this fact, we see that languages such as\n$\\lbrace (ab)^2 \\rbrace^*$ is not star-free, although it is regular.\nIndeed, if we pick $u=v=w=ab$ as in the statement of the proposition\nabove, we see that $uv^nw$ is in the language iff $uv^{n+1}w$ is not in\nthe language, for any $n\\ge 0$. Therefore, the second inclusion in chain\n(1) above is also strict.\n\nThe above proposition also strengthens chain (1): denote by\n$\\mathscr{T}(\\infty)$ the family of locally testable languages, then\n$$\\mathscr{T}(\\infty)\\subset \\mathscr{SF} \\subset \\mathscr{R}.$$ The\nfirst inclusion is due to the fact that, for any $k$-testable language\n$L$ (over some $\\Sigma$), we have\n$$\\operatorname{sw}_k(uv^kw)=\\operatorname{sw}_k(uv^{k+1}w)$$ (the\ndefinition of $\\operatorname{sw}_k(u)$ is found in the entry on locally\ntestable languages). Note the first inclusion is also strict. For\nexample, the language represented by $(ab)^*\\cup (ba)^*$ is star-free\nbut not locally testable.\n\n[9]{} A.
