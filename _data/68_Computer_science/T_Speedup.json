  "definition": "*Speedup* is a way to quantify the advantage of using a parallel\nalgorithm over a sequential algorithm. The speedup $S$ is defined as\n\n$$S = \\frac{R}{P}$$ Where $R$ is the running time of the best available\nsequential algorithm and $P$ is the running time of the parallel\nalgorithm.\n\nIdeally, on a system with $N$ processors, the speedup for any algorithm\nwould be $N$. Amdahl\u2019s law deals with the speedup in more realistic\nsituations.",
