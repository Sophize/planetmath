  "statement": "Let $\\Sigma$ be an alphabet. Fix an order on elements of $\\Sigma$, so\nthat they are $a_1,\\ldots, a_n$. For each word $w$ over $\\Sigma$, we can\nform an $n$-tuple $(w_1,\\ldots, w_n)$ so that each $w_i$ is the number\nof occurrences of $a_i$ in $w$. The function\n$\\Psi: \\Sigma^* \\to \\mathbb{N}^n$ such that\n$$\\Psi(w)=(w_1,\\ldots, w_n)$$ is called the *Parikh mapping* (over the\nalphabet $\\Sigma$). Here, $\\mathbb{N}$ is the set of non-negative\nintegers.\n\nTwo languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ over some $\\Sigma$ are called\n*letter-equivalent* if $\\Psi(L_1)=\\Psi(L_2)$.\n\nFor example, $L_1:=\\lbrace a^nb^n \\mid n\\ge 0\\rbrace$ is\nletter-equivalent to the $L_2:=\\lbrace (ab)^n \\mid n\\ge 0 \\rbrace$, as\nboth are mapped to the set $\\lbrace (n,n)\\mid n\\ge 0\\rbrace$ by $\\Psi$.\nNote that $L_1$ is context-free, while $L_2$ is regular. In fact, we\nhave the following:\n\nEvery context-free language is letter-equivalent to a regular language.\n\nLike the pumping lemma, Parikh\u2019s theorem can be used to show that\ncertain languages are not context-free. But in order to apply Parikh\u2019s\ntheorem above, one needs to know more about the structure of the set\n$\\Psi(L)$ for a given context-free language $L$.\n\nFirst, note that $\\mathbb{N}^n$ is a commutative monoid under addition.\nFor any element $x$ and subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{N}^n$, define $x+S$ in\nthe obvious manner. Next, let $x_1,\\ldots, x_m$ be elements of\n$\\mathbb{N}^n$. Denote $$\\langle x_1,\\ldots, x_m \\rangle$$ the submonoid\ngenerated by $x_1,\\ldots, x_m$.\n\nA subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{N}^n$ is said to be *linear* if it has the form\n$$x_0 + \\langle x_1,\\ldots, x_m\\rangle,$$ for some\n$x_0,\\ldots, x_m \\in \\mathbb{N}^n$. It is not hard to see that every\nlinear set is the image of some regular language under $\\Psi$. For\nexample,\n$$(1,0,0)+\\langle (2,1,0),(0,3,2)\\rangle = \\Psi(\\lbrace a(a^2b)^m (b^3c^2)^n \\mid m,n\\ge 0\\rbrace).$$\nThe example can be easily generalized.\n\nA subset of $\\mathbb{N}^n$ is said to be *semilinear* if it is the union\nof finitely many linear sets. Since regular languages are closed under\nunion, every semilinear set is the image of a regular language under\n$\\Psi$. As a result, Parikh\u2019s theorem can be restated as\n\nIf $L$ is context-free, then $\\Psi(L)$ is semilinear.\n\nUsing this theorem, one easily sees that the language\n$\\lbrace a^p \\mid p \\text{ is a prime number } \\rbrace$ is not\ncontext-free, and neither is the language\n$$\\lbrace a^m b^n \\mid \\mbox{ either }m\\mbox{ is prime, and }n\\ge m,\\mbox{ or }n\\mbox{ is prime, and }m\\ge n\\rbrace,$$\nwhich can not be proved by the pumping lemma in a straightforward\nmanner.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The converse of Theorem 2 above is false. For example, let\n    $L=\\lbrace a^nb^nc^n \\mid n\\ge 0\\rbrace$. Then $L$ is not\n    context-free by the pumping lemma. However,\n    $\\Psi(L)=\\langle (1,1,1)\\rangle$, which is clearly linear.\n\n-   In the literature, a lanugage $L$ such that $\\Psi(L)$ is semilinear\n    is often called a *slip-language*. It can be shown that for a\n    slip-language $L$ over an alphabet consisting of two symbols, the\n    language $\\Psi^{-1}\\circ \\Psi(L)$ is context-free.\n\n[9]{} H.R. Lewis, C.H.
