  "definition": "Just like every context-free grammar can be \u201cnormalized\u201d or\n\u201cstandardized\u201d in one of the so-called , so can a context-sensitive\ngrammar, and in fact arbitrary grammar, be normalized. The particular\nnormalization discussed in this entry is what is known as the Kuroda\nnormal form.\n\nA formal grammar $G=(\\Sigma,N,P,\\sigma)$ is in *Kuroda normal form* if\nits productions have one of the following forms:\n\n1.  $A\\to a$,\n\n2.  $A\\to BC$,\n\n3.  $AB\\to CD$.\n\nwhere $a\\in \\Sigma-N$ and $A,B,C,D\\in N$.\n\nNote: Sometimes the form $A\\to B$, where $B\\in N$ is added to the list\nabove. However, we may remove a production of this form by replacing all\noccurrences of $B$ by $A$ in every production of $G$.\n\nThe usefulness of the Kuroda normal forms is captured in the following\nresult:\n\nA grammar is length-increasing iff it is equivalent to a grammar in\nKuroda normal form.\n\nNote that the third production form $AB\\to CD$ may be replaced by the\nfollowing productions\n\n[2]{}\n\n1.  $AB\\to AX$\\\n    \\[-3ex\\]\n\n2.  $AX\\to YX$\\\n    \\[-3ex\\]\n\n3.  $YX\\to YD$\\\n    \\[-3ex\\]\n\n4.  $YD\\to CD$\\\n    \\[-3ex\\]\n\nwhere $X,Y$ are new non-terminals introduced to $G$. Note also that,\namong the new forms, 1 and 3 are right context-sensitive, while 2 and 4\nare left context-sensitive. Thus, a grammar in Kuroda normal form is\nequivalent to a grammar with productions having one of the following\nforms:\n\n1.  $A\\to a$,\n\n2.  $A\\to BC$,\n\n3.  $AB\\to AC$,\n\n4.  $AB\\to CB$.\n\nIt can be shown that\n\nA grammar in Kuroda normal form if it is equivalent to a grammar whose\nproductions are in one of forms $1,2$, or $3$.\n\nBy symmetry, a grammar in Kuroda normal form is equivalent to a grammar\nwhose productions are in one of forms $1,2$, or $4$. A grammar whose\nproductions are in one of forms $1,2$, or $3$ is said to be in\n*one-sided normal form*.\n\nAs a corollary, every $\\lambda$-free context-sensitive language (not\ncontaining the empty word $\\lambda$) can be generated by a grammar in\none-sided normal form.\n\nWhat if we throw in production of the form $A\\to \\lambda$ in the above\nlist? Then certainly every context-sensitive language has a grammar in\nthis \u201cextended\u201d normal form. In fact, we have\n\nEvery type-0 language can be generated by a grammar whose productions\nare in one of the following forms:\n\n1.  $A\\to a$,\n\n2.  $A\\to BC$,\n\n3.  $AB\\to AC$,\n\n4.  $A\\to \\lambda$.\n\n[9]{} G.
