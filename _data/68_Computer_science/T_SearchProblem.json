Every search problem has a\ncorresponding decision problem, namely\n$L(R)=\\{x\\mid \\exists y R(x,y)\\}$.\n\nThis definition may be generalized to $n$-ary relations using any\nsuitable encoding which allows multiple strings to be compressed into\none string (for instance by listing them consecutively with a\ndelimiter).",
