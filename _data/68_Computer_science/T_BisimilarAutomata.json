  "definition": "Let $M=(S_M,\\Sigma,\\delta_M,I_M,F_M)$ and\n$N=(S_N,\\Sigma,\\delta_N,I_N,F_N)$ be two NDFA\u2019s (non-deterministic\nfinite automata). Let $\\approx \\subseteq S_M \\times S_N$ be a binary\nrelation between the states of the automata $M$ and $N$. We may extend\n$\\approx$ to a binary relation between subsets of the states of the\nautomata, as follows: for any $P\\subseteq S_M$ and $Q \\subseteq S_N$,\nset\n$$C(P):=\\lbrace q\\in S_N\\mid p\\approx q\\mbox{ for some }p\\in P\\rbrace\\mbox{ and }C(Q):=\\lbrace p\\in S_M\\mid p\\approx q\\mbox{ for some }q\\in Q\\rbrace.$$\nThen, using the same notation, define\n$\\approx \\subseteq P(S_M)\\times P(S_N)$ by\n$$P \\approx Q \\mbox{ iff }P \\subseteq C(Q)\\mbox{ and }Q \\subseteq C(P).$$\n\n**Definition**. We say that $M$ is *bisimilar* to $N$ if there is a\nbinary relation $\\approx \\subseteq S_M \\times S_N$ such that\n\n1.  $I_M \\approx I_N$,\n\n2.  if $p \\approx q$, then $\\delta_M(p,a) \\approx \\delta_N(q,a)$ for any\n    $a\\in \\Sigma$,\n\n3.  if $p \\approx q$, then $p\\in F_M$ iff $q\\in F_N$.\n\nIn other words, $M$ is bisimilar to $N$ as automata precisely when $M$\nis bisimilar to $N$ as LTS, and satisfy conditions $1$ and $3$ above.\n\nAny NDFA $M=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ is bisimilar to itself, for the\nidentity relation is clearly a bisimulation. Next, if $M$ is bisimilar\nto $N$ with bisimulation $\\approx$, $N$ is bisimilar to $M$ with the\nconverse relation $\\approx^{-1}$. Finally, if $M$ is bisimilar to $N$\nwith bisimulation $\\approx_1$ and $N$ is bisimilar to $P$ with\nbisimulation $\\approx_2$, $M$ is bisimilar to $N$ with bisimulation\n$\\approx_1\\circ \\approx_2$. Therefore, bisimilarity is an equivalence\nrelation on the class of NDFA\u2019s.\n\nAnother property of bisimulations on NDFA\u2019s is that the they are\npreserved by taking unions: an arbitrary non-empty union of\nbisimulations is again a bisimulation. From this property, it is not\nhard to show that if $A\\approx B$, then $\\delta(A,x)\\approx \\delta(B,x)$\nfor any word over $\\Sigma$. As a result, bismilar NDFA\u2019s accept the same\nset of words.\n\nBy taking the union of all bisimulations on a given NDFA\n$M=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$, we get a bisimulation that is also an\nequivalence relation on the set of states of $M$. For each $p\\in S$, let\n$[p]$ be the equivalence class containing $p$, and for any subset\n$A\\subseteq S$, let $[A]:=\\lbrace [p]\\mid p\\in A\\rbrace$. Then we get an\nNDFA $[M]:=([S],\\Sigma,[\\Delta],[I],[F])$, with\n$$[\\Delta]([p],a):=[\\delta(p,a)]$$ for any $a\\in \\Sigma$. It can be\nshown that $[M]$ is minimal in the sense that $[[M]]$ is isomorphic to\n$[M]$, and that $M$ is bisimilar to $[M]$. In addition, if $M$ has no\ninaccessible states, then $M$ is bisimilar to a unique minimal\nautomaton, in the sense that, if $N$ is any minimal automaton bisimlar\nto $M$, then $N$ is isomorphic to $[M]$.",
