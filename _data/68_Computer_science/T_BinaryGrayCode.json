  "definition": "An $n$-bit binary *Gray code* is a non-repeating sequence of the\nintegers from $0$ to $2^n-1$ inclusive such that the binary\nrepresentation of each number in the sequence differs by exactly one bit\nfrom the binary representation of the previous number: that is, the\nHamming distance between consecutive elements is $1$. In addition, we\nalso define a *cyclic Gray code* to be a Gray code where an extra\ncondition is imposed: The last number in the sequence must differ by\nexactly one bit from the first number in the sequence.\n\nFor example, one $3$-bit cyclic Gray code is:\n\n$$000_2$$ $$010_2$$ $$011_2$$ $$001_2$$ $$101_2$$ $$111_2$$ $$110_2$$\n$$100_2$$\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between all possible $n$-bit Gray\ncodes and all possible Hamiltonian cycles on an $n$-dimensional\nhypercube. (To see why this is so, imagine assigning a binary number to\neach vertex of a hypercube where an edge joins each pair of vertices\nthat differ by exactly one bit.)",
