  "definition": "Let $A$ be an alphabet. A *code over $A$* is any subset $C$ of the set\nof words $A^*$ on the alphabet $A$ such that $C$ has \u201cuniquue\nfactorization into letters,\u201d i.e., such that for whenever\n$a_1\\ldots a_n=b_1\\ldots b_m$, with all $a_i,b_j\\in C$, then we have\n$n=m$ and $a_i=b_i$ for all $i$. In other words, every \u201cword over $A$\u201d\ngenerated by $C$ (considered as an alphabet) can be uniquely factored\ninto \u201cletters\u201d in C.\n\nAn example of a subset of $A^*$ which is *not* a code is given by\n$C=\\lbrace ab, c, a, bc \\rbrace$. Here the word $abc$ can be written\neither as $(ab)c$ or as $a(bc)$ in terms of elements of $C$. Since\n$ab \\ne a$ nor $c\\ne bc$, $C$ is not a code.\n\nIf we fix a length $n$ for the words, i.e. we require that\n$C\\subset A^n$, then we call $C$ a *block code*, and call $n$ the *block\nlength* of the code. An important property of a code is the code\u2019s\n*minimum distance*, given by the minimum Hamming distance between any\npair of words in $C$.\n\nThis notion of code is obviously very general. In practice (i.e., in\ncoding theory) one typically takes codes with a little more structure.\nSee, in particular, linear codes.",
