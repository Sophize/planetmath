  "definition": "*MultiSieve* is a computer program written by Mark Rodenkirch and\ndesigned for primality testing. It uses \u201cboth trial division and\ndiscrete logs as a sieve to eliminate numbers faster,\u201d according to\nRodenkirch. It is available for Windows on the Intel x86 platform, and\nRodenkirch has worked on a port for Mac OS X. According to the prime\npages of the University of Tennessee at Martin, the largest prime\nMultiSieve has found so far is $338707 \\times 2^{1354830} + 1$,\napproximately $9.97354620220965 \\times 10^{407849}$.",
