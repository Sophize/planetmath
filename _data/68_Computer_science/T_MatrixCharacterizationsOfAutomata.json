  "definition": "Let $A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ be a finite automaton. Recall that $A$ can\nbe visualized by a directed graph $G_A$ called the state diagram of $A$.\nThe nodes of $G_A$ are the states of $A$ (elements of $S$), and the\nedges of $G_A$ are labeled by the input symbols of $A$ (elements of\n$\\Sigma$).\n\nSuppose $S=\\lbrace s_1,\\ldots, s_n\\rbrace$. For each symbol\n$a\\in \\Sigma$, we define an $n\\times n$ matrix $M(a)$ over the\nnon-negative integers as follows: the cell $$M_{ij}:= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\textrm{if }s_j\\in \\delta(s_i,a), \\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ In other words, $M(a)$ is a matrix composed of $0$\u2019s and\n$1$\u2019s, such that cell $(i,j)$ is $1$ provided that there is an edge from\nnode $s_i$ to $s_j$ with label $a$. $M$ may be viewed as a function from\n$\\Sigma$ to the set $\\mathfrak{M}(n)$ of $n\\times n$ matrices whose\nentries are $1$\u2019s and $0$\u2019s, mapping $a$ to $M(a)$ just described.\n\nTo completely describe $A$, we use two $n$-dimensional vectors $v_I$ and\n$v_F$ to specify $I$ and $F$ respectively. The $i$-th component of $v_I$\nis $1$ if and only if $s_i$ is a start state. Otherwise, it is a $0$.\n$v_F$ is defined similarly. Thus, the triple $(M,v_I,v_F)$ describes\n$A$.\n\nThe following is the state diagram of an automaton with two states\n$s_1,s_2$ over $\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and its description by matrices:\n\nConversely, given a triple $(M,v,w)$, where\n$M:\\Sigma \\to \\mathfrak{M}(n)$ is a function, and $v,w$ are two\n$n$-dimensional vectors $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, we can construct an\nautomaton $A_M$ as follows: $A_M=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ where\n\n1.  $S$ has $n$ elements $s_1,\\ldots, s_n$;\n\n2.  $I$ is a subset of $S$ such that $s_i\\in I$ iff the $i$-th component\n    of $v$ is $1$;\n\n3.  $F$ is a subset of $S$ such that $s_j\\in F$ iff the $j$-th component\n    of $w$ is $1$;\n\n4.  for each pair $(s_i,a)\\in S\\times \\Sigma$, $\\delta(s_i,a)$ is the\n    subset of $S$ such that $s_j\\in \\delta(s_i,a)$ iff cell $(i,j)$ of\n    $m(a)$ is $1$.\n\nLet us look more closely now at the function $M$. Given a function\n$M:\\Sigma \\to \\mathfrak{M}(n)$, we may extend it in a unique way to a\nhomomorphism from $\\Sigma^*$ to $\\mathfrak{M}(n)^*$, the monoid of\n$n\\times n$ matrices generated by $\\mathfrak{M}(n)$, where the\nmultiplication is defined by the ordinary matrix multiplication. In\nother words, if $u_1,u_2$ are words over $\\Sigma$,\n$$m(u_1u_2)=m(u_1)m(u_2),$$ the product of matrices $m(u_1)$ and\n$m(u_2)$. We use the same notation $M$ for this extension. In the\nexample above, we see that\n$$M(a^2) = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right), \\quad \nM(ab) = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right), \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad\nM(b^2) = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array} \\right).$$\n\nThe following two lemmas are some consequences:\n\nFor any word $u$ over $\\Sigma$, cell $(i,j)$ of the matrix $M(u)$ is the\nnumber of paths from $s_i$ to $s_j$ with label $u$.\n\nTreating $v_I$ as a row vector and $v_F$ as a column vector, we get\n\nFor any word $u$ over $\\Sigma$,\n\n-   the $i$-th component of the row vector $v_I M(u)$ is the number of\n    paths from a start state to $s_i$ with label $u$.\n\n-   the $j$-th component of the column vector $M(u) v_F$ is the number\n    of paths from $s_j$ to a final state with label $u$.\n\n-   $v_I M(u) v_F$ is the number of paths from a start state to a final\n    state with label $u$.\n\nCombining the two lemmas, it is easy to see that\n\nA language $R$ over $\\Sigma$ is regular iff it can be expressed by a\ntriple $(M,v,w)$ described above in the following sense:\n$$R=\\lbrace u\\in \\Sigma^* \\mid vM(u)w > 0 \\rbrace$$ where $v$ is written\nas a row vector, and $w$ is written as a column vector.",
