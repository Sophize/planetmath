  "argumentText": "Suppose an algorithm needs $n$ operations to compute the result. With 1\nprocessor, the algorithm will take $n$ time units. With $N$ processors,\nthe $(1-f)n$ parallelizable operations will take $\\frac{(1-f)n}{N}$ time\nunits and the remaining $fn$ non parallelizable operations will take\n$fn$ time units for a total running time of $fn+\\frac{(1-f)n}{N}$ time\nunits. So the speedup $S$ is\n$\\frac{n}{fn+\\frac{(1-f)n}{N}}=\\frac{1}{f+\\frac{1-f}{N}}$.",
