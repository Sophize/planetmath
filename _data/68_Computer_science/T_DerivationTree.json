  "definition": "Given a formal grammar $G=(\\Sigma,N,P,\\sigma)$, recall that a derivation\nfrom words $u$ to $v$ over $\\Sigma$ can be visualized as a finite\nsequence of words over $\\Sigma$, connected by the binary relation\n$\\Rightarrow$:\n$$u_0 \\Rightarrow u_1 \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow u_n$$ where $u=u_0$\nand $v=u_n$. Each $u_i \\Rightarrow u_{i+1}$ is a derivation step, which\nmeans that there is a production in $P$ which, when applied to $u_i$,\nyields $u_{i+1}$. In other words, there is $A\\to B$ in $P$ such that\n$u_i=xAy$ and $u_{i+1}=xBy$, where $x,y$ are words over $\\Sigma$.\n\nWhen the formal grammar $G$ is context-free, a derivation can be\nrepresented by an ordered tree, revealing the structure behind the\nderivation that is usually not apparent in the linear representation\n$(1)$ above. This ordered tree is variously known as a *derivation tree*\nor a *parse tree*, depending how it is being used.\n\nIn the foregoing discussion, $G$ is context-free, and any derivation of\n$G$ begins with $\\sigma$, the starting non-terminal.\n\n**Definition**. A *parse tree* of $G$ is an ordered tree $T$ such that\n\n1.  the nodes of $T$ are labeled by elements of $\\Sigma$, or the empty\n    word $\\lambda$,\n\n2.  if a node with label $A$ has children $N_1, \\ldots, N_k$ such that\n    $N_1 < \\cdots < N_k$, and that each $N_i$ has label $A_i$, then\n    $A \\to A_1 \\cdots A_k$ is a production of $P$.\n\nA parse tree such that the root has label $\\sigma$ is called a\n*derivation tree*, or a *generation tree*. Every subtree of a derivation\ntree is a parse tree.\n\n**Remark**. Since $G$ is context-free, in a parse tree, any node that is\nnot a leaf is labeled by a non-terminal symbol.\n\nFor example, if $\\Sigma = \\lbrace \\sigma, a, b, X, Y\\rbrace$,\n$N=\\lbrace \\sigma, X, Y\\rbrace$, and the productions of $P$ are\n$$\\sigma \\to aXY, \\quad X\\to bYb, \\quad Y\\to Xa, \\quad Y\\to a,$$ then\n\n![image](dtree.eps)\n\nrepresents a derivation tree of $G$. The tree represents the following\nderivations\n\n-   $\\sigma \\Rightarrow aXY \\Rightarrow abYbY \\Rightarrow abXabY \\Rightarrow abXabb$\n\n-   $\\sigma \\Rightarrow aXY \\Rightarrow abYbY \\Rightarrow abYbb \\Rightarrow abXabb$\n\n-   $\\sigma \\Rightarrow aXY \\Rightarrow aXb \\Rightarrow abYbb \\Rightarrow abXabb$\n\n**Definition**. If $\\ell_1, \\ldots, \\ell_m$ are the leaves of a parse\ntree $T$, with $\\ell_1 < \\cdots < \\ell_m$, then the *result* of $T$ is\nthe word $B_1\\cdots B_m$, where $B_i\\in \\Sigma$ is the label of\n$\\ell_i$. A word over $\\Sigma$ is said to *correspond* to a parse tree\nif it is the result of the tree.\n\nIn the example above, the result of the tree is $abXabb$.\n\n**Remark**. A derivable word may correspond to several derivation trees.\nSee the entry ambiguous grammar for more detail.\n\n[9]{} H.R. Lewis, C.H. Papadimitriou, [*Elements of the Theory of\nComputation*]{}.
