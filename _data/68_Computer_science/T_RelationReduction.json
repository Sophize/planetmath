  "definition": "**Relation reduction** and **relational reducibility** have to do with\nthe extent to which a given relation is determined by an indexed family\nor a sequence of other relations, called the *relation dataset*. The\nrelation under examination is called the *reductand*. The relation\ndataset typically consists of a specified set of other relations,\nsimpler in some measure than the reductand, called the *reduction base*,\nplus a specified operation on relations, called the *reduction method*\nor the *reduction step*.\n\nA question of relation reduction or relational reducibility is sometimes\nposed as a question of **relation reconstruction** or **relational\nreconstructibility**, since a useful way of stating the question is to\nask whether the reductand can be reconstructed from the relational\ndataset.\n\nA relation that is not uniquely determined by a particular relation\ndataset is said to be irreducible in just that respect. A relation that\nis not uniquely determined by any relation dataset in a particular class\nof relation datasets is said to be irreducible in respect of that class.\n\nDiscussion\n==========\n\nThe main thing that keeps the general problem of relational reducibility\nfrom being fully well-defined is that one would have to survey all of\nthe conceivable ways of \u201cgetting new relations from old\" in order to say\nprecisely what is meant by the claim that the relation $L$ is reducible\nto the set of relations $\\{ L_j : j \\in J \\}$. This is tantamount to\nclaiming that if one is given a set of \u201csimpler\" relations $L_j$, for\nindices $j$ in some set $J$, that this collection of data would somehow\nor other fix the original relation $L$ that one is seeking to analyze,\nto determine, to specify, or to synthesize.\n\nIn practice, however, apposite discussion of a particular application\ntypically settles on either one of two different notions of reducibility\nas capturing the pertinent issues, namely:\n\n-   Reduction under .\n\n-   Reduction under projections.\n\nAs it happens, there is an interesting relationship between these two\nnotions of reducibility, the implications of which may be taken up\npartly in parallel with the discussion of the basic concepts.\n\nProjective reducibility of relations\n====================================\n\nIt is convenient to begin with the *projective reduction* of relations,\npartly because this type of reduction is simpler and more intuitive (in\nthe visual sense), but also because a number of conceptual tools that\nare needed in any case arise quite naturally in the projective setting.\n\nThe work of intuiting how projections operate on multidimensional\nrelations is often facilitated by keeping in mind the following sort of\ngeometric image:\n\n-   Picture a $k$-adic relation $L$ as a body that resides in a\n    $k$-dimensional space $X$. If the domains of the relation $L$ are\n    $X_1, \\ldots, X_k$, then the *extension* of the relation $L$ is a\n    subset of the cartesian product $X = X_1 \\times \\ldots \\times X_k$.\n\nIn this setting, the interval $K = [1, k] = \\{ 1, \\ldots, k \\}$ is\ncalled the *index set* of the *indexed family* of sets\n$X_1, \\ldots, X_k$.\n\nFor any subset $F$ of the index set $K$, there is the corresponding\nsubfamily of sets, $\\{ X_j : j \\in F \\}$, and there is the corresponding\ncartesian product over this subfamily, notated and defined as\n$X_F = \\prod_{j \\in F} X_j$.\n\nFor any point $x$ in $X$, the *projection* of $x$ on the subspace $X_F$\nis notated as $\\operatorname{proj}_{F}(x)$, or still more simply as\n$\\operatorname{proj}_{F}x.$\n\nMore generally, for any relation $L \\subseteq X$, the projection of $L$\non the subspace $X_F$ is written as $\\operatorname{proj}_{F}(L)$, or\nstill more simply as $\\operatorname{proj}_{F}L.$\n\nThe question of *projective reduction* for $k$-adic relations can be\nstated with moderate generality in the following way:\n\n-   Given a set of $k$-place relations in the same space $X$ and a set\n    of projections from $X$ to the associated subspaces, do the\n    projections afford sufficient data to tell the different relations\n    apart?\n\nProjective reducibility of triadic relations\n============================================\n\nSee on triadic relations.\n\nBy way of illustrating the different sorts of things that can occur in\nconsidering the projective reducibility of relations, it is convenient\nto reuse the four examples of 3-adic relations that are discussed in the\nmain entry on that subject.\n\nExamples of projectively irreducible relations\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe 3-adic relations $L_0$ and $L_1$ are shown in the next two Tables:\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> $X$ & $Y$ & $Z$\\\n> 0 & 0 & 0\\\n> 0 & 1 & 1\\\n> 1 & 0 & 1\\\n> 1 & 1 & 0\\\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> $X$ & $Y$ & $Z$\\\n> 0 & 0 & 1\\\n> 0 & 1 & 0\\\n> 1 & 0 & 0\\\n> 1 & 1 & 1\\\n\nViewed in terms of operations on relational data tables, a 2-adic\nprojection of a 3-adic relation $L$ is the 2-adic relation that results\nfrom deleting one column of the table for $L$ and then deleting all but\none row of any resulting rows that happen to be identical in content. In\nother words, the multiplicity of any repeated row is ignored.\n\nIn the case of the above two relations,\n$L_0, L_1 \\subseteq X \\times Y \\times Z \\cong \\mathbb{B}^3$, the 2-adic\nprojections are indexed by the columns or domains that remain, as shown\nin the following Tables.\n\n> [|c|c|p[2cm]{}|c|c|p[2cm]{}|c|c|]{} & & & &\\\n> $X$ & $Y$ & & $X$ & $Z$ & & $Y$ & $Z$\\\n> 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0\\\n> 0 & 1 & & 0 & 1 & & 1 & 1\\\n> 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & & 0 & 1\\\n> 1 & 1 & & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 0\\\n\n> [|c|c|p[2cm]{}|c|c|p[2cm]{}|c|c|]{} & & & &\\\n> $X$ & $Y$ & & $X$ & $Z$ & & $Y$ & $Z$\\\n> 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & & 0 & 1\\\n> 0 & 1 & & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 0\\\n> 1 & 0 & & 1 & 0 & & 0 & 0\\\n> 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1\\\n\nIt is clear on inspection that the following three equations hold:\n\n> $\\begin{array}{lcr}\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{XY}L_0 = \\operatorname{proj}_{XY}L_1, &\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{XZ}L_0 = \\operatorname{proj}_{XZ}L_1, &\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{YZ}L_0 = \\operatorname{proj}_{YZ}L_1. \\\\\n> \\end{array}$\n\nThese equations say that $L_0$ and $L_1$ cannot be distinguished from\neach other solely on the basis of their 2-adic projection data. In such\na case, either relation is said to be *irreducible with respect to\n2-adic projections*. Since reducibility with respect to 2-adic\nprojections is the only interesting case where it concerns the reduction\nof 3-adic relations, it is customary to say more simply of such a\nrelation that it is *projectively irreducible*, the 2-adic basis being\nunderstood. It is immediate from the definition that projectively\nirreducible relations always arise in non-trivial multiplets of mutually\nindiscernible relations.\n\nExamples of projectively reducible relations\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe 3-adic sign relations $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are\nshown in the next two Tables:\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> Object & Sign & Interpretant\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> Object & Sign & Interpretant\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n\nIn the case of the two sign relations,\n$L_{\\mathrm{A}}, L_{\\mathrm{B}} \\subseteq X \\times Y \\times Z \\cong O \\times S \\times I$,\nthe 2-adic projections are indexed by the columns or domains that\nremain, as shown in the following Tables.\n\n> [|c|c|p[1cm]{}|c|c|p[1cm]{}|c|c|]{} & & & &\\\n> Object & Sign & & Object & Interpretant & & Sign & Interpretant\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n\n> [|c|c|p[1cm]{}|c|c|p[1cm]{}|c|c|]{} & & & &\\\n> Object & Sign & & Object & Interpretant & & Sign & Interpretant\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{A}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``A\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``A\"}$\\\n> $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & & $\\mathrm{B}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & &\n> $\\mathrm{``u\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``u\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``B\"}$\\\n> & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$ & $\\mathrm{``i\"}$\\\n\nIt is clear on inspection that the following three inequations hold:\n\n> $\\begin{array}{lcr}\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{OS}L_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ne \\operatorname{proj}_{OS}L_{\\mathrm{B}}, &\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{OI}L_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ne \\operatorname{proj}_{OI}L_{\\mathrm{B}}, &\n> \\operatorname{proj}_{SI}L_{\\mathrm{A}} \\ne \\operatorname{proj}_{SI}L_{\\mathrm{B}}. \\\\\n> \\end{array}$\n\nThese inequations say that $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{B}}$ can be\ndistinguished from each other solely on the basis of their 2-adic\nprojection data. But this is not enough to say that either one of them\nis projectively reducible to their 2-adic projection data. To say that a\n3-adic relation is projectively reducible in that respect, one has to\nshow that it can be distinguished from *every* other 3-adic relation on\nthe basis of the 2-adic projection data alone.\n\nIn other words, to show that a 3-adic relation $L$ on\n$O \\times S \\times I$ is *reducible* or *reconstructible* in the 2-adic\nprojective sense, it is necessary to show that no distinct $L'$ on\n$O \\times S \\times I$ exists such that $L$ and $L'$ have the same set of\nprojections. Proving this takes a much more comprehensive or exhaustive\ninvestigation of the space of possible relations on\n$O \\times S \\times I$ than looking merely at one or two relations at a\ntime.\n\n**Fact.** As it happens, each of the relations $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and\n$L_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is uniquely determined by its 2-adic projections. This\ncan be seen by following the proof that is given below.\n\nBefore tackling the proof, however, it will speed things along to recall\na few ideas and notations from other articles.\n\n-   If $L$ is a relation over a set of domains that includes the domains\n    $U$ and $V$, then the abbreviated notation $L_{UV}$ can be used for\n    the projection $\\operatorname{proj}_{UV}L$.\n\n-   The operation of reversing a projection asks what elements of a\n    bigger space project onto given elements of a smaller space. The set\n    of elements that project onto $x$ under a given projection $f$ is\n    called the *fiber* of $x$ under $f$ and is written $f^{-1}(x)$ or\n    $f^{-1}x$.\n\n-   If $X$ is a finite set, the *cardinality* of $X$, written\n    $\\operatorname{card}(X)$ or $|X|$, means the number of elements in\n    $X$.\n\n**Proof.** Let $L$ be either one of the relations $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ or\n$L_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Consider any coordinate position $(s, i)$ in the\n$SI$-plane $S \\times I$. If $(s, i)$ is not in $L_{SI}$ then there can\nbe no element $(o, s, i)$ in $L$, therefore we may restrict our\nattention to positions $(s, i)$ in $L_{SI}$, knowing that there exist at\nleast $|L_{SI}| = 8$ elements in $L$, and seeking only to determine what\nobjects $o$ exist such that $(o, s, i)$ is an element in the fiber of\n$(s, i)$. In other words, for what $o$ in $O$ is $(o, s, i)$ in the\nfiber $\\operatorname{proj}_{SI}^{-1}(s, i)$? Now, the circumstance that\n$L_{OS}$ has exactly one element $(o, s)$ for each coordinate $s$ in $S$\nand that $L_{OI}$ has exactly one element $(o, i)$ for each coordinate\n$i$ in $I$, plus the \u201ccoincidence\" of it being the same $o$ at any one\nchoice for $(s, i)$, tells us that $L$ has just the one element\n$(o, s, i)$ over each point of $S \\times I$. All together, this proves\nthat both $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are reducible in an\ninformative sense to 3-tuples of 2-adic relations, that is, they are\n*projectively 2-adically reducible*.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThe *projective analysis* of 3-adic relations, illustrated by means of\nconcrete examples, has been pursued just far enough at this point to\nstate this clearly demonstrated result:\n\n-   Some 3-adic relations are, and other 3-adic relations are not,\n    reducible to, or reconstructible from, their 2-adic projection data.\n    In short, some 3-adic relations are projectively reducible and some\n    3-adic relations are projectively irreducible.",
