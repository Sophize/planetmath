  "definition": "Let $\\Sigma$ be an alphabet, and $u,v$ words over $\\Sigma$. An\n*insertion* of $u$ into $v$ is a word of the form $v_1uv_2$, where\n$v=v_1v_2$. The concatenation of two words is just a special case of\ninsertion. Also, if $w$ is an insertion of $u$ into $v$, then $v$ is a\ndeletion of $u$ from $w$.\n\n*The insertion* of $u$ into $v$ is the set of all insertions of $v$ into\n$u$, and is denoted by $v\\rhd u$.\n\nThe notion of insertion can be extended to languages. Let $L_1,L_2$ be\ntwo languages over $\\Sigma$. The insertion of $L_1$ into $L_2$, denoted\nby $L_1 \\rhd L_2$, is the set of all insertions of words in $L_1$ into\nwords in $L_2$. In other words,\n$$L_1 \\rhd L_2 = \\bigcup \\lbrace u\\rhd v\\mid u\\in L_1, v\\in L_2 \\rbrace.$$\nSo $u \\rhd v = \\lbrace u\\rbrace \\rhd \\lbrace v\\rbrace$.\n\nA language $L$ is said to be *insertion closed* if\n$L\\rhd L \\subseteq L$. Clearly $\\Sigma^*$ is insertion closed, and\narbitrary intersection of insertion closed languages is insertion\nclosed. Given a language $L$, the *insertion closure* of $L$, denoted by\n$\\operatorname{Ins}(L)$, is the smallest insertion closed language\ncontaining $L$. It is clear that $\\operatorname{Ins}(L)$ exists and is\nunique.\n\nMore to come...\n\nThe concept of insertion can be generalized. Instead of the insertion of\n$u$ into $v$ taking place in one location in $v$, the insertion can take\nplace in several locations, provided that $u$ must also be broken up\ninto pieces so that each individual piece goes into each inserting\nlocation. More precisely, given a positive integer $k$, a *$k$-insertion\nof $u$ into $v$* is a word of the form\n$$v_1 u_1 \\cdots v_k u_k v_{k+1}$$ where $u=u_1 \\cdots u_k$ and\n$v=v_1 \\cdots v_{k+1}$. So an insertion is just a $1$-insertion. *The\n$k$-insertion* of $u$ into $v$ is the set of all $k$-insertions of $u$\ninto $v$, and is denoted by $u \\rhd^{[k]} v$. Clearly\n$\\rhd^{[1]} = \\rhd$.\n\n**Example**. Let $\\Sigma=\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and $u=aba$, $v=bab$, and\n$w=bababa$. Then\n\n-   $w$ is an insertion of $u$ into $v$, as well as an insertion of $v$\n    into $u$, for $w=vu\\lambda = \\lambda v u$.\n\n-   $w$ is also a $2$-insertion of $u$ into $v$:\n\n    -   the decompositions $u=(ab)(a)$ and $v=(b)(ab)\\lambda$\n\n    -   or the decompositions $u=\\lambda u$ and $v=\\lambda v\\lambda$\n\n    produce $(b)(ab)(ab)(a)\\lambda = \\lambda \\lambda v u \\lambda = w$.\n\n-   Finally, $w$ is also a $2$-insertion of $v$ into $u$, as the\n    decompositions $u = \\lambda u \\lambda$ and $v= v \\lambda$ produce\n    $\\lambda v u\\lambda  \\lambda = w$.\n\n-   $u\\rhd v=\\lbrace ababab, babaab, baabab, bababa\\rbrace$.\n\nFrom this example, we observe that a $k$-insertion is a\n$(k+1)$-insertion, and every $k$-insertion of $u$ into $v$ is a\n$(k+1)$-insertion of $v$ into $u$. As a result,\n$$u \\rhd^{[k]} v \\subseteq (u \\rhd^{[k+1]} v) \\cap (v \\rhd^{[k+1]} u).$$\n\nAs before, given languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, *the $k$-insertion* of $L_1$\ninto $L_2$, denoted by $L_1 \\rhd^{[k]} L_2$, is the union of all\n$u \\rhd^{[k]} v$, where $u\\in L_1$ and $v\\in L_2$.\n\n**Remark**. Some closure properties regarding insertions: let\n$\\mathscr{R}$ be the family of regular languages, and $\\mathscr{F}$ the\nfamily of context-free languages. Then $\\mathscr{R}$ is closed under\n$\\rhd^{[k]}$, for each positive integer $k$. $\\mathscr{F}$ is closed\n$\\rhd^{[k]}$ only when $k=1$. If $L_1\\in \\mathscr{R}$ and\n$L_2\\in \\mathscr{F}$, then $L_1 \\rhd^{[k]} L_2$ and $L_2 \\rhd^{[k]} L_1$\nare both in $\\mathscr{F}$. The proofs of these closure properties can be\nfound in the reference.\n\n[9]{} M. Ito, [*Algebraic Theory of Automata and Languages*]{}, World\nScientific, Singapore (2004).",
