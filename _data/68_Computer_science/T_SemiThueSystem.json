  "definition": "A *semi-Thue system* $\\mathfrak{S}$ is a pair $(\\Sigma, P)$ where\n$\\Sigma$ is an alphabet and $P$ is a non-empty finite binary relation on\n$\\Sigma^*$, the Kleene star of $\\Sigma$.\n\nElements of $P$ are variously called *defining relations*,\n*productions*, or *rewrite rules*, and $\\mathfrak{S}$ itself is also\nknown as a *rewriting system*. If $(x,y)\\in P$, we call $x$ the\n*antecedent*, and $y$ the *consequent*. Instead of writing $(x,y)\\in P$\nor $xPy$, we usually write $$x\\to y.$$\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{S}=(\\Sigma,P)$ be a semi-Thue system. Given a word $u$\nover $\\Sigma$, we say that a word $v$ over $\\Sigma$ is *immediately\nderivable* from $u$ if there is a defining relation $x\\to y$ such that\n$$u=rxs\\qquad\\mbox{ and }\\qquad v=rys,$$ for some words $r,s$ (which may\nbe empty) over $\\Sigma$. If $v$ is immediately derivable from $u$, we\nwrite $$u\\Rightarrow v.$$ Let $P'$ be the set of all pairs\n$(u,v)\\in \\Sigma^*\\times \\Sigma^*$ such that $u\\Rightarrow v$. Then\n$P\\subseteq P'$, and\n\n> If $u\\Rightarrow v$, then $wu\\Rightarrow wv$ and $uw\\Rightarrow vw$\n> for any word $w$.\n\nNext, take the reflexive transitive closure $P''$ of $P'$. Write\n$a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$ for $(a,b)\\in P''$. So\n$a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$ means that either $a=b$, or there is a\nfinite chain $a=a_1,\\ldots,a_n=b$ such that $a_i\\Rightarrow a_{i+1}$ for\n$i=1,\\ldots,n-1$. When $a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$, we say that $b$\nis *derivable* from $a$. Concatenation preserves derivability:\n\n> $a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$ and $c{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}d$\n> imply $ac{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}bd$.\n\n**Example**. Let $\\mathfrak{S}$ be a semi-Thue system over the alphabet\n$\\Sigma=\\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace$, with the set of defining relations given\nby $P=\\lbrace ab\\to bc, bc \\to cb \\rbrace$. Then words $ac^3b$,\n$a^2c^2b$ and as $bc^4$ are all derivable from $a^2bc^2$:\n\n-   $a^2bc^2 \\Rightarrow a(bc)c^2 \\Rightarrow ac(bc)c \\Rightarrow ac^2(cb) = ac^3b$,\n\n-   $a^2bc^2 \\Rightarrow a^2(cb)c \\Rightarrow a^2c(cb) = a^2c^2b$, and\n\n-   $a^2bc^2 \\Rightarrow a(bc)c^2 \\Rightarrow (bc)cc^2 = bc^4$.\n\nUnder $\\mathfrak{S}$, we see that if $v$ is derivable from $u$, then\nthey have the same length: $|u|=|v|$. Furthermore, if we denote $|a|_u$\nthe number of occurrences of letter $a$ in a word $u$, then\n$|a|_v\\le |a|_u$, $|c|_v\\ge |c|_u$, and $|b|_v = |b|_u$. Also, in order\nfor a word $u$ to have a non-trivial word $v$ (non-trivial in the sense\nthat $u\\ne v$) derivable from it, $u$ must have either $ab$ or $bc$ as a\nsubword. Therefore, words like $a^3$ or $c^3b^4a^2$ have no non-trivial\nderived words from them.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  Given a semi-Thue system $\\mathfrak{S}=(\\Sigma,P)$, one can\n    associate a subset $A$ of $\\Sigma^*$ whose elements we call *axioms*\n    of $\\mathfrak{S}$. Any word $v$ that is derivable from an axiom\n    $a\\in A$ is called a *theorem* (of $\\mathfrak{S}$). If $v$ is a\n    theorem, we write $A \\vdash_{\\mathfrak{S}} v$. The set of all\n    theorems is written $L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A)$, and is called the\n    language (over $\\Sigma$) generated by $A$.\n\n2.  Let $\\mathfrak{S}$ and $A$ be defined as above, and $T$ any\n    alphabet. Call the elements of $T\\cap \\Sigma$ the *terminals* of\n    $\\mathfrak{S}$. The set $$L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A)\\cap T^*$$ is called\n    the *language generated by $A$ over $T$*, and written\n    $L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A,T)$. It is easy to see that\n    $L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A,T)=L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A,T\\cap \\Sigma)$.\n\n3.  A language $L$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$ is said to be *generable by\n    a semi-Thue system* if there is a semi-Thue system $\\mathfrak{S}$\n    and a finite set of axioms $A$ of $\\mathfrak{S}$ such that\n    $L= L_{\\mathfrak{S}}(A,\\Sigma)$.\n\n4.  Semi-Thue systems are \u201cequivalent\u201d to formal grammars in the\n    following sense:\n\n    > a language is generable by a formal grammar iff it is semi-Thue\n    > generable.\n\n    The idea is to turn every defining relation $x\\to y$ in $P$ into a\n    production $SxT\\to SyT$, where $S$ and $T$ are non-terminals or\n    variables. As such, a production of the form $SxT\\to SyT$ is\n    sometimes called a *semi-Thue production*.\n\n5.  Given a semi-Thue system $\\mathfrak{S}=(\\Sigma,P)$, the *word\n    problem* for $\\mathfrak{S}$ asks whether or not for any pair of\n    words $u,v$ over $\\Sigma$, one can determine in a finite number of\n    steps (an algorithm) that $u{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}v$. If such\n    an algorithm exists, we say that the word problem for $\\mathfrak{S}$\n    is solvable. It turns out there exists a semi-Thue system such that\n    the word problem for it is unsolvable.\n\n6.  The word problem for a specific $\\mathfrak{S}$ is the same as\n    finding an algorithm to determine whether $v$ is a theorem based on\n    a singleton axiom $\\lbrace u\\rbrace$ for arbitrary words $u,v$.\n\n7.  *The word problem for semi-Thue systems* asks whether or not, given\n    *any* semi-Thue system $\\mathfrak{S}$, the word problem for\n    $\\mathfrak{S}$ is solvable. From the previous remark, we see the\n    word problem for semi-Thue systems is unsolvable.\n\n[9]{} M. Davis, [*Computability and Unsolvability*]{}. Dover\nPublications, New York (1982). H.
