  "definition": "It is convenient to identify a natural number $n$ with the $n$th binary\nstring in lexicographic order: $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & \\epsilon \\\\\n1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 00 \\\\\n4 & 01 \\\\\n5 & 10 \\\\\n6 & 11 \\\\\n7 & 000 \\\\\n\\ldots & \\ldots\n\\end{array}$$ The more common [*binary notation*]{} for numbers fails to\nbe a bijection because of leading zeroes. Yet, there is a close\nrelation: the $n$th binary string is the result of stripping the leading\n1 from the binary notation of $n+1$.\n\nWith this correspondence in place, we can talk about such things as the\nlength $l(n)$ of a number $n$, which can be seen to equal\n$\\lfloor \\log (n+1) \\rfloor$.",
