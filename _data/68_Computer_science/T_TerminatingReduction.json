  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set and $\\to$ a reduction (binary relation) on $X$. A\n*chain* with respect to $\\to$ is a sequence of elements\n$x_1,x_2,x_3,\\ldots$ in $X$ such that $x_1\\to x_2$, $x_2\\to x_3$, etc...\nA chain with respect to $\\to$ is usually written\n$$x_1\\to x_2 \\to x_3 \\to \\cdots \\to x_n \\to \\cdots.$$ The length of a\nchain is the cardinality of its underlying sequence. A chain is finite\nif its length is finite. Otherwise, it is infinite.\n\n**Definition**. A reduction $\\to$ on a set $X$ is said to be\n*terminating* if it has no infinite chains. In other words, every chain\n*terminates*.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n-   If $\\to$ is reflexive, or non-trivial symmetric, then it is never\n    terminating.\n\n-   Let $X$ be the set of all positive integers greater than $1$. Define\n    $\\to$ on $X$ so that $a\\to b$ means that $a=bc$ for some $c\\in X$.\n    Then $\\to$ is a terminating reduction. By the way, $\\to$ is also a\n    normalizing reduction.\n\n-   In fact, it is easy to see that a terminating reduction is\n    normalizing: if $a$ has no normal form, then we may form an infinite\n    chain starting from $a$.\n\n-   On the other hand, not all normalizing reduction is terminating. A\n    canonical example is the set of all non-negative integers with the\n    reduction $\\to$ defined by $a\\to b$ if and only if\n\n    -   either $a,b\\ne 0$, $a\\ne b$, and $a<b$,\n\n    -   or $a\\ne 0$ and $b=0$.\n\n    The infinite chain is given by $1\\to 2\\to 3\\to \\cdots $, so that\n    $\\to$ is not terminating. However, $n\\to 0$ for every positive\n    integer $n$. Thus every integer has $0$ as its normal form, so that\n    $\\to$ is normalizing.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   A reduction is said to be *convergent* if it is both terminating and\n    confluent.\n\n-   A relation is terminating iff the transitive closure of its inverse\n    is well-founded.\n\n    To see this, first let $R$ be terminating on the set $X$. And let\n    $S$ be the transitive closure of $R^{-1}$. Suppose $A$ is a\n    non-empty subset of $X$ that contains no $S$-minimal elements. Pick\n    $x_0 \\in A$. Then we can find $x_1\\in A$ with $x_1\\ne x_0$, such\n    that $x_1 S x_0$. By the assumption on $A$, this process can be\n    iterated indefinitely. So we have a sequence $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots$\n    such that $x_{i+1} S x_i$ with $x_i\\ne x_{i+1}$. Since each pair\n    $(x_i,x_{i+1})$ can be expanded into a finite chain with respect to\n    $R$, we have produced an infinite chain containing elements\n    $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots$, contradicting the assumption that $R$ is\n    terminating.\n\n    On the other hand, suppose the transitive closure $S$ of $R^{-1}$ is\n    well-founded. If the chain $x_0 R x_1 R x_2 R \\cdots$ is infinite,\n    then the set $\\lbrace x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots \\rbrace$ has no\n    $S$-minimal elements, as $x_i S x_j$ whenever $i>j$, and $j$\n    arbitrary.\n\n-   The reflexive transitive closure of a terminating relation is a\n    partial order.\n\nA closely related concept is the descending chain condition (DCC). A\nreduction $\\to$ on $X$ is said to satisfy the *descending chain\ncondition (DCC)* if the only infinite chains on $X$ are those that are\neventually constant. A chain $x_1\\to x_2 \\to x_3 \\to \\cdots $ is\neventually constant if there is a positive integer $N$ such that for all\n$n\\ge N$, $x_n=x_N$. Every terminating relation satisfies DCC. The\nconverse is obviously not true, as a reflexive reduction illustrates.\n\nAnother related concept is acyclicity. Let $\\to$ be a reduction on $X$.\nA chain $x_0\\to x_1 \\to \\cdots x_n$ is said to be cyclic if $x_i=x_j$\nfor some $0\\le i < j\\le n$. This means that there is a \u201cclosed loop\u201d in\nthe chain. The reduction $\\to$ is said to be *acyclic* if there are no\ncyclic chains with respect to $\\to$. Every terminating relation is\nacyclic, but not conversely. The usual strict inequality relation on the\nset of positive integers is an example of an acyclic but non-terminating\nrelation.",
