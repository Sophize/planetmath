  "statement": "The invariance theorem states that a universal Turing machine provides\nan optimal means of description, up to a constant. Formally, for every\nTuring machine $M$ there exists a constant $c$ such that for all binary\nstrings $x$ we have $$C_U(x) \\leq C_M(x) + c.$$ Here, $C_U$ means the\ncomplexity with respect to the universal Turing machine and $C_M$ means\nthe complexity with respect to $M$.\n\nThis follows trivially from the definition of a universal Turing\nmachine, taking $c = l(<M>)$ as the length of the encoding of $M$.\n\nThe invariance theorem holds likewise for prefix and conditional\ncomplexities.",
