  "definition": "Recall that a linear grammar is a formal grammar\n$G=(\\Sigma, N,P,\\sigma)$ whose productions are of the form $A\\to x$,\nwhere $A$ is a terminal symbol, and $x$ is a word over $\\Sigma$, with at\nmost one occurrence of a non-terminal symbol.\n\nThe concept of a linear grammar can be generalized: define a $k$-linear\ngrammar as a formal grammar $G=(\\Sigma, N,P,\\sigma)$ such that every\nproduction in $P$ has one of the three following forms:\n\n-   $A\\to u$,\n\n-   $A\\to uBv$,\n\n-   $\\sigma \\to W$,\n\nwhere $A,B$ are non-terminal symbols, $u,v$ are terminal words, and $W$\nis a word over $\\Sigma$ with no more than $k$ occurrences of\nnon-terminal symbols, and none of which is the start symbol $\\sigma$.\nAny $k$-linear grammar is context-free.\n\nA language is said to be $k$-linear if it can be generated by a\n$k$-linear grammar. Note that a language is $1$-linear iff it is linear.\n\nA language is said to be *metalinear* if it is $k$-linear for some\npositive integer $k$. In other words, if $\\mathscr{L}(k)$ denotes the\nfamily of $k$-linear languages, then the family $\\mathscr{L}(\\infty)$ of\nmetalinear langauges is\n$$\\mathscr{L}(\\infty)=\\bigcup \\lbrace \\mathscr{L}(k) \\mid k\\ge 1\\rbrace.$$\n\nIt is easy to see we have the following inclusions\n$$\\mathscr{R}\\subseteq \\mathscr{L}(k) \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathscr{L}(k) \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathscr{L}(\\infty) \\subseteq \\mathscr{F}$$\nwhere $\\mathscr{R}$ and $\\mathscr{F}$ are the families of regular and\ncontext-free languages respectively.\n\nIn fact, it can be shown that all of the inclusions above are strict,\nproviding us with an infinite chain of families of languages between the\nregular languages and the context-free languages.\n\n[9]{} A.
