  "definition": "In the parent entry, a quasigroup is defined as a set, together with a\nbinary operation on it satisfying two formulas, both of which using\nexistential quantifiers. In this entry, we give an alternative, but\nequivalent, definition of a quasigroup using only universally quantified\nformulas. In other words, the class of quasigroups is an equational\nclass.\n\n**Definition**. A *quasigroup* is a set $Q$ with three binary operations\n$\\cdot$ (multiplication), $\\backslash$ (*left division*), and $/$\n(*right division*), such that the following are satisfied:\n\n-   $(Q,\\cdot)$ is a groupoid (not in the category theoretic sense)\n\n-   (left division identities) for all $a,b\\in Q$,\n    $a \\backslash (a \\cdot b)=b$ and $a\\cdot (a \\backslash b) = b$\n\n-   (right division identities) for all $a,b\\in Q$, $(a \\cdot b)/ b=a$\n    and $(a/b) \\cdot b = a$\n\nThe two definitions of a quasigroup are equivalent.\n\nSuppose $Q$ is a quasigroup using the definition given in the . Define\n$\\backslash$ on $Q$ as follows: for $a,b\\in Q$, set $a\\backslash b:=c$\nwhere $c$ is the unique element such that $a\\cdot c = b$. Because $c$ is\nunique, $\\backslash$ is well-defined. Now, let $x = a\\cdot b$ and\n$y = a\\backslash x$. Since $a\\cdot y = x = a \\cdot b$, and $y$ is\nuniquely determined, this forces $y=b$. Next, let $x=a\\backslash b$,\nthen $a \\cdot x =b$, or $a \\cdot (a\\backslash b) = b$. Similarly, define\n$/$ on $Q$ so that $a/b$ is the unique element $d$ such that\n$d\\cdot b=a$. The verification of the two right division identities is\nleft for the reader.\n\nConversely, let $Q$ be a quasigroup as defined in this entry. For any\n$a,b\\in Q$, let $c=a\\backslash b$ and $d=b/a$. Then\n$a \\cdot c = a \\cdot (a \\backslash b) = b$ and\n$d \\cdot a = (b/a) \\cdot a = b$.",
