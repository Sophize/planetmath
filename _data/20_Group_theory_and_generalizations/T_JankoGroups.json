  "definition": "The Janko groups denoted by $J_1, J_2, J_3$, and $J_4$ are four of the\n26 sporadic groups. They were discovered by . Janko in 1966 and\npublished in the article \"A new finite simple group with abelian Sylow\n$2$-subgroups and its characterization.\u201d (Journal of Algebra, **3**,\n1966, 32: 147-186).\n\nEach of these groups have very intricate matrix representations as maps\ninto large general linear groups. For example, the matrix $K$\ncorresponding to $J_4$ gives a representation of $J_4$ in $GL_{112}(2)$.",
