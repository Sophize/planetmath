If $|G|=1$ then there is no $p$ which divides its\norder, so the condition is trivial.\n\nSuppose $|G|=p^mk$, $p\\nmid k$, and the holds for all groups of smaller\norder. Then we can consider whether $p$ divides the order of the center,\n$Z(G)$.\n\nIf it does, then by Cauchy\u2019s theorem, there is an element $f$ of $Z(G)$\nof order $p$, and therefore a cyclic subgroup generated by $f$,\n$\\langle f\\rangle$, also of order $p$. Since this is a subgroup of the\ncenter, it is normal, so $G/\\langle f\\rangle$ is well-defined and of\norder $p^{m-1}k$. By the inductive hypothesis, this group has a subgroup\n$P/\\langle f\\rangle$ of order $p^{m-1}$. Then there is a corresponding\nsubgroup $P$ of $G$ which has\n$|P|=|P/\\langle f\\rangle|\\cdot|\\langle f\\rangle|=p^m$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $p\\nmid |Z(G)|$ then consider the conjugacy\nclasses not in the center. By the proposition above, since $Z(G)$ is not\ndivisible by $p$, at least one conjugacy class can\u2019t be. If $a$ is a\nrepresentative of this class then we have $p\\nmid |[a]|=[G:C(a)]$, and\nsince $|C(a)|\\cdot[G:C(a)]=|G|$, $p^m\\mid |C(a)|$. But $C(a)\\neq G$,\nsince $a\\notin Z(G)$, so $C(a)$ has a subgroup of order $p^m$, and this\nis also a subgroup of $G$.\n\nThe intersection of a Sylow p-subgroup with the normalizer of a Sylow\np-subgroup is the intersection of the subgroups. That is,\n$Q\\cap N_G(P)=Q\\cap P$.\n\nIf $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow p-subgroups, consider $R=Q\\cap N_G(P)$.\nObviously $Q\\cap P\\subseteq R$. In addition, since $R\\subseteq N_G(P)$,\nthe second isomorphism theorem tells us that $RP$ is a group, and\n$|RP|=\\frac{|R|\\cdot|P|}{|R\\cap P|}$. $P$ is a subgroup of $RP$, so\n$p^m\\mid |RP|$. But $R$ is a subgroup of $Q$ and $P$ is a Sylow\np-subgroup, so $|R|\\cdot |P|$ is a multiple of $p$. Then it must be that\n$|RP|=p^m$, and therefore $P=RP$, and so $R\\subseteq P$. Obviously\n$R\\subseteq Q$, so $R\\subseteq Q\\cap P$.\n\nThe following construction will be used in the remainder of the proof:\n\nGiven any Sylow p-subgroup $P$, consider the set of its conjugates $C$.\nThen $X\\in C\\leftrightarrow X=xPx^{-1}=\\{xpx^{-1}|\\forall p\\in P\\}$ for\nsome $x\\in \nG$. Observe that every $X\\in C$ is a Sylow p-subgroup (and we will show\nthat the converse holds as well). We let $G$ act on $C$ by conjugation:\n$$g\\cdot X=g\\cdot xPx^{-1}=gxPx^{-1}g^{-1}=(gx)P(gx)^{-1}$$\n\nThis is clearly a group action, so we can consider the orbits of $P$\nunder it; this remains true if we only consider elements from some\nsubset of $G$. Of course, if all $G$ is used then there is only one\norbit, so we restrict the action to a Sylow p-subgroup $Q$. the orbits\n$O_1,\\ldots, O_s$, and let $P_1,\\ldots, P_s$ be representatives of the\ncorresponding orbits. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of an\norbit is the index of the stabilizer, and under this action the\nstabilizer of any $P_i$ is just $N_Q(P_i)=Q\\cap N_G(P_i)=Q\\cap P$, so\n$|O_i|=[Q:Q\\cap P_i]$.\n\nThere are two easy results on this construction. If $Q=P_i$ then\n$|O_i|=[P_i:P_i\\cap P_i]=1$. If $Q\\neq P_i$ then $[Q:Q\\cap P_i]>1$, and\nsince the index of any subgroup of $Q$ divides $Q$, $p\\mid |O_i|$.\n\nThe number of conjugates of any Sylow p-subgroup of $G$ is congruent to\n$1$ modulo $p$\n\nIn the construction above, let $Q=P_1$. Then $|O_1|=1$ and $p\\mid |O_i|$\nfor $i\\neq 1$. Since the number of conjugates of $P$ is the sum of the\nnumber in each orbit, the number of conjugates is of the form\n$1+k_2p+k_3p+\\cdots+k_sp$, which is obviously congruent to $1$ modulo\n$p$.\n\nAny two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate\n\nGiven a Sylow p-subgroup $P$ and any other Sylow p-subgroup $Q$,\nconsider again the construction given above. If $Q$ is not conjugate to\n$P$ then $Q\\neq P_i$ for every $i$, and therefore $p\\mid |O_i|$ for\nevery orbit. But then the number of conjugates of $P$ is divisible by\n$p$, contradicting the previous result. Therefore $Q$ must be conjugate\nto $P$.\n\nThe number of subgroups of $G$ of order $p^m$ is congruent to $1$ modulo\n$p$ and is a factor of $k$\n\nSince conjugates of a Sylow p-subgroup are precisely the Sylow\np-subgroups, and since a Sylow p-subgroup has $1$ modulo $p$ conjugates,\nthere are $1$ modulo $p$ Sylow p-subgroups.\n\nSince the number of conjugates is the index of the normalizer, it must\nbe $|G:N_G(P)|$. Since $P$ is a subgroup of its normalizer,\n$p^m\\mid N_G(P)$, and therefore $|G:N_G(P)|\\mid k$.",
