  "definition": "An abelian group $D$ is said to be divisible if for any $x\\in D$,\n$n\\in{{\\mathbb}{Z}}^+$, there exists an element $x'\\in D$ such that\n$nx'=x$.\n\nSome noteworthy facts:\n\n-   An abelian group is (as a ${{\\mathbb}{Z}}$-module) if and only if it\n    is divisible.\n\n-   Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a divisible group.\n\n-   Any divisible abelian group is isomorphic to the direct sum of its\n    torsion subgroup and $n$ copies of the group of rationals (for some\n    cardinal number $n$).",
