  "definition": "Let $S$ be a semigroup. An *ideal* of $S$ is a non-empty subset of $S$\nwhich is closed under multiplication on either side by elements of $S$.\nFormally, $I$ is an ideal of $S$ if $I$ is non-empty, and for all\n$x \\in I$ and $s \\in S$, we have $sx \\in I$ and $xs \\in I$.\n\nOne-sided ideals are defined similarly. A non-empty subset $A$ of $S$ is\na *left ideal* (resp. *right ideal*) of $S$ if for all $a \\in A$ and\n$s \\in S$, we have $sa \\in A$ (resp. $as \\in A$).\n\nA *principal left ideal* of $S$ is a left ideal generated by a single\nelement. If $a \\in S$, then the principal left ideal of $S$ generated by\n$a$ is $S^1a = Sa \\cup \\{a\\}$. (The notation $S^1$ is explained .)\n\nSimilarly, the *principal right ideal* generated by $a$ is\n$aS^1 = aS \\cup \\{a\\}$.\n\nThe notation $L(a)$ and $R(a)$ are also common for the principal left\nand right ideals generated by $a$ respectively.\n\nA *principal ideal* of $S$ is an ideal generated by a single element.\nThe ideal generated by $a$ is\n$$S^1aS^1 = SaS \\cup Sa \\cup aS \\cup \\{a\\}.$$ The notation\n$J(a) = S^1aS^1$ is also common.",
