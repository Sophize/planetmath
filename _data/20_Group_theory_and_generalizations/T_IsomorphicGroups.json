  "definition": "Two groups $(X_1,\\,*_1)$ and $(X_2,\\,*_2)$ are said to be\n[*isomorphic*]{} if there is a group isomorphism\n$\\psi\\colon X_1\\to X_2$.\n\nNext we name a few necessary conditions for two groups $X_1,\\,X_2$ to be\nisomorphic (with isomorphism $\\psi$ as above).\n\n1.  [*If two groups are isomorphic, then they have the same\n    cardinality*]{}. Indeed, an isomorphism is in particular a bijection\n    of sets.\n\n2.  [*If the group $X_1$ has an element $g$ of order $n$, then the group\n    $X_2$ must have an element of the same order*]{}. If there is an\n    isomorphism $\\psi$ then $\\psi(g)\\in X_2$ and\n    $(\\psi(g))^n=\\psi(g^n)=\\psi(e_1)=e_2$ where $e_i$ is the identity\n    elements of $X_i$. Moreover, if $(\\psi(g))^m=e_2$ then\n    $\\psi(g^m)=e_2$ and by the injectivity of $\\psi$ we must have\n    $g^m=e_1$ so $n$ divides $m$. Therefore the order of $\\psi(g)$ is\n    $n$.\n\n3.  [*If one group is cyclic, the other one must be cyclic too*]{}.\n    Suppose $X_1$ is cyclic generated by an element $g$. Then it is easy\n    to see that $X_2$ is generated by the element $\\psi(g)$. Also [*if\n    $X_1$ is finitely generated, then $X_2$ is finitely generated as\n    well*]{}.\n\n4.  [*If one group is abelian, the other one must be abelian as\n    well*]{}. Indeed, suppose $X_2$ is abelian. Then\n    $$\\psi(g*_1 h)=\\psi(g)*_2 \\psi(h)=\\psi(h)*_2 \\psi(g) =\\psi(h*_1 g)$$\n    and using the injectivity of $\\psi$ we conclude $g*_1 h=h*_1 g$.\n\n**Note.** Isomorphic groups are sometimes said to be [*abstractly\nidentical*]{}, because their \u201cabstract\u201d are completely similar \u2014 one may\nthink that their elements are the same but have only different names.",
