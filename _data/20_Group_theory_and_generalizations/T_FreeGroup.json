It follows that if $F$ is freely generated by both $A$ and\n$B$, then $|A|=|B|$. So the rank of a free group is a well-defined\nconcept, and free groups of different ranks are non-isomorphic.\n\nFor every cardinal number $\\kappa$ there is, up to isomorphism, exactly\none free group of rank $\\kappa$. The abelianization of a free group of\nrank $\\kappa$ is a free abelian group of rank $\\kappa$.\n\nEvery group is a homomorphic image of some free group. More precisely,\nif $G$ is a group generated by a set of cardinality $\\kappa$, then $G$\nis a homomorphic image of every free group of rank $\\kappa$ or more.\n\nThe states that every of a free group is itself free.\n\nConstruction {#construction .unnumbered}\n============\n\nFor any set $A$, the following construction gives a free group of rank\n$|A|$.\n\nLet $A$ be a set with elements $a_{i}$ for $i$ in some index set $I$. We\nrefer to $A$ as an *alphabet* and the elements of $A$ as *letters*. A\n*syllable* is a symbol of the form $a_{i}^n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. It\nis customary to write $a$ for $a^1$. Define a *word* to be a finite\nsequence of syllables. For example, $$a_2^3a_1a_4^{-1}a_3^2a_2^{-3}$$ is\na five-syllable word. Notice that there exists a unique *empty word*,\ni.e., the word with no syllables, usually written simply as $1$. Denote\nthe set of all words formed from elements of $A$ by $\\WA$.\n\nDefine a binary operation, called the product, on $\\WA$ by concatenation\nof words. To illustrate, if $a_2^{3}a_1$ and $a_1^{-1}a_3^{4}$ are\nelements of $\\WA$ then their product is simply\n$a_2^{3}a_1a_1^{-1}a_3^{4}$. This gives $\\WA$ the structure of a monoid.\nThe empty word $1$ acts as a in $\\WA$, and is the only element which has\nan inverse. In order to give $\\WA$ the structure of a group, two more\nideas are needed.\n\nIf $v=u_1a_i^0u_2$ is a word where $u_1,u_2$ are also words and $a_i$ is\nsome element of $A$, an *elementary contraction of type I* replaces the\noccurrence of $a^0$ by $1$. Thus, after this type of contraction we get\nanother word $w=u_1u_2$. If $v=u_1a_i^pa_i^qu_2$ is a word, an\n*elementary contraction of type II* replaces the occurrence of\n$a_i^pa_i^q$ by $a_i^{p+q}$ which results in $w=u_1a_i^{p+q}u_2$. In\neither of these cases, we also say that $w$ is obtained from $v$ by an\nelementary contraction, or that $v$ is obtained from $w$ by an\nelementary expansion.\n\nCall two words $u,v$ equivalent (denoted $u \\sim v$) if one can be\nobtained from the other by a finite sequence of elementary contractions\nor expansions. This is an equivalence relation on $\\WA$. Let $\\FA$ be\nthe set of equivalence classes of words in $\\WA$. Then $\\FA$ is group\nunder the operation $$[u][v] = [uv]$$ where $[u] \\in \\FA$. The inverse\n$[u]^{-1}$ of an element $[u]$ is obtained by reversing the order of the\nsyllables of $[u]$ and changing the sign of each syllable. For example,\nif $[u] = [a_1a_3^{2}]$, then $[u]^{-1} = [a_3^{-2}a_1^{-1}]$.\n\nIt can be shown that $\\FA$ is a free group freely generated by the set\n$\\{[x]\\mid x\\in A\\}$. Moreover, a group is free if and only if it is\nisomorphic to $\\FA$ for some set $A$.",
