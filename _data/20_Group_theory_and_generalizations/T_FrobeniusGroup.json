  "definition": "A permutation group $G$ on a set $X$ is [*Frobenius*]{} if no\nnon-trivial element of $G$ fixes more than one element of $X$.\nGenerally, one also makes the restriction that at least one non-trivial\nelement fix a point. In this case the Frobenius group is called\n[*non-regular*]{}.\n\nThe stabilizer of any point in $X$ is called a [*Frobenius\ncomplement*]{}, and has the remarkable property that it is distinct from\nany conjugate by an element not in the subgroup. Conversely, if any\nfinite group $G$ has such a subgroup, then the action on cosets of that\nsubgroup makes $G$ into a Frobenius group.",
