A group $G$ is\n*virtually $\\chi$* if it has a subgroup of finite index with the\nproperty $\\chi$. A group $G$ is *$\\chi$-by-finite* if it has a normal\nsubgroup of finite index with the property $\\chi$. Note that every\n$\\chi$-by-finite group is virtually $\\chi$, and the converse also holds\nif the property $\\chi$ is inherited by subgroups.\n\nThese notions are obviously only of relevance to infinite groups, as all\nfinite groups are virtually trivial (and trivial-by-finite).",
