  "statement": "**First orthogonality relations**: Let\n$\\rho_\\alpha\\colon G \\to V_\\alpha$ and $\\rho_\\beta\\colon G \\to V_\\beta$\nbe irreducible representations of a finite group $G$ over the field\n${\\mathbb{C}}$. Then\n$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}\\overline{\\rho^{(\\alpha)}_{ij}(g)}\\rho^{(\\beta)}_{kl}(g)=\\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl}}{\\dim V_\\alpha}.$$\n\nWe have the following useful corollary. Let $\\chi_1$, $\\chi_2$ be\ncharacters of representations $V_1$, $V_2$ of a finite group $G$ over a\nfield $k$ of characteristic $0$. Then\n\n$$(\\chi_1,\\chi_2)=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}\\overline{\\chi_1(g)}\\chi_2(g)=\\dim({\\mathrm{Hom}(V_1,V_2)}).$$\n\nFirst of all, consider the special case where $V=k$ with the trivial\naction of the group. Then $\\mathrm{Hom}_G(k,V_2)\\cong V_2^G$, the fixed\npoints. On the other hand, consider the map\n$$\\phi=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G} g\\colon V_2\\to V_2$$ (with the sum in\n$\\mathrm{End}(V_2)$). Clearly, the image of this map is contained in\n$V_2^G$, and it is the identity restricted to $V_2^G$. Thus, it is a\nprojection with image $V_2^G$. Now, the rank of a projection (over a\nfield of characteristic 0) is its trace. Thus,\n$$\\dim_k \\mathrm{Hom}_G(k,V_2)=\\dim V_2^G=\\mathrm{tr}(\\phi)=\n\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum\\chi_2(g)$$ which is exactly the orthogonality formula\nfor $V_1=k$.\n\nNow, in general, $\\mathrm{Hom}(V_1,V_2)\\cong V_1^*\\otimes V_2$ is a\nrepresentation, and $\\mathrm{Hom}_G(V_1,v_2)=(\\mathrm{Hom}(V_1,V_2))^G$.\nSince $\\chi_{V^*_1\\otimes V_2}=\\overline{\\chi_1}\\chi_2$,\n\n$$\\dim_k\\mathrm{Hom}_G(V_1,V_2)=\\dim_k (\\mathrm{Hom}(V_1,V_2))^G=\n\\sum_{g\\in G}\\overline{\\chi_1}\\chi_2$$ which is exactly the relation we\ndesired.\n\nIn particular, if $V_1, V_2$ irreducible, by Schur\u2019s Lemma\n\n$${\\mathrm{Hom}(V_1,V_2)}=\\begin{cases} D &V_1\\cong V_2\\\\ 0&V_1\\ncong V_2\\end{cases}$$\n\nwhere $D$ is a division algebra. In particular, non-isomorphic\nirreducible representations have orthogonal characters. Thus, for any\nrepresentation $V$, the multiplicities $n_i$ in the unique decomposition\nof $V$ into the of irreducibles\n\n$$V\\cong V_1^{\\oplus n_1}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus V_m^{\\oplus n_m}$$\n\nwhere $V_i$ ranges over irreducible representations of $G$ over $k$, can\nbe determined in terms of the character inner product:\n\n$$n_i=\\frac{(\\psi,\\chi_i)}{(\\chi_i,\\chi_i)}$$\n\nwhere $\\psi$ is the character of $V$ and $\\chi_i$ the character of\n$V_i$. In particular, representations over a field of characteristic\nzero are determined by their character. Note: This is not true over\nfields of positive characteristic.\n\nIf the field $k$ is algebraically closed, the only finite division\nalgebra over $k$ is $k$ itself, so the characters of irreducible\nrepresentations form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of class\nfunctions with respect to this inner product. Since $(\\chi_i,\\chi_i)=1$\nfor all irreducibles, the multiplicity formula above reduces to\n$n_i=(\\psi,\\chi_i)$.\n\n**Second orthogonality relations**: We assume now that $k$ is\nalgebraically closed. Let $g,g'$ be elements of a finite group $G$. Then\n$$\\sum_{\\chi}\\chi(g)\\overline{\\chi(g')}=\\begin{cases}|C_G(g_1)|&g\\sim g'\\\\ 0&g\\nsim g'\\end{cases}$$\nwhere the sum is over the characters of irreducible representations, and\n$C_G(g)$ is the centralizer of $g$.\n\nLet $\\chi_1,\\ldots,\\chi_n$ be the characters of the irreducible\nrepresentations, and let $g_1,\\ldots,g_n$ be representatives of the\nconjugacy classes.\n\nLet $A$ be the matrix whose $ij$th entry is\n$\\sqrt{|G:C_G(g_j)|}(\\overline{\\chi_i(g_j)})$. By first orthogonality,\n$AA^{*}=|G|I$ (here $*$ denotes conjugate transpose), where $I$ is the\nidentity matrix. Since left are right , $A^{*}A=|G|I$. Thus,\n$$\\sqrt{|G:C_G(g_i)||G:C_G(g_k)|}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\chi_j(g_i)\\overline{\\chi_j(g_k)}=|G|\\delta_{ik}.$$\nReplacing $g_i$ or $g_k$ with any conjuagate will not change the\nexpression above. thus, if our two elements are not conjugate, we obtain\nthat $\\sum_\\chi\\chi(g)\\overline{\\chi(g')}=0$. On the other hand, if\n$g\\sim g'$, then $i=k$ in the sum above, which reduced to the expression\nwe desired.\n\nA special case of this result, applied to $1$ is that\n$|G|=\\sum_{\\chi}\\chi(1)^2$, that is, the sum of the squares of the of\nthe irreducible representations of any finite group is the order of the\ngroup.",
