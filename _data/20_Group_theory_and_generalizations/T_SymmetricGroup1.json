  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set. Let $S(X)$ be the set of permutations of $X$ (i.e. the\nset of bijective functions on $X$). Then the act of taking the\ncomposition of two permutations induces a group structure on $S(X)$. We\ncall this group the [*symmetric group*]{} and it is often denoted\n${\\rm Sym}(X)$.\n\nWhen $X$ has a finite number $n$ of elements, we often refer to the\nsymmetric group as $S_n$, and describe the elements by using cycle\nnotation.",
