  "statement": "Bruhat decomposition is the name for the fact that\n$B\\backslash G/B = W$, where $G$ is a reductive group, $B$ a Borel\nsubgroup, and $W$ the Weyl group. Less canonically, one can write\n$G = BWB$.\n\nIn the case of the general linear group $G = GL_n$, $B$ is the group of\nnonsingular upper triangular matrices, and $W$ is the collection of\npermutation matrices (and is isomorphic to $S_n$). Any nonsingular\nmatrix can thus be written uniquely as a product of an upper triangular\nmatrix, a permutation matrix, and another upper triangular matrix.",
