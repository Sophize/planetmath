  "definition": "A group $G$ is *locally finite* if any finitely generated subgroup of\n$G$ is finite.\n\nA locally finite group is a torsion group. The converse, also known as\nthe Burnside Problem, is not true. Burnside, however, did show that if a\nmatrix group is torsion, then it is locally finite.\n\n(Kaplansky) If $G$ is a group such that for a normal subgroup $N$ of\n$G$, $N$ and $G/N$ are locally finite, then $G$ is locally finite.\n\nA solvable torsion group is locally finite. To see this, let\n$G = G_0 \\supset G_1 \\supset \\cdots \\supset G_n = (1)$ be a composition\nseries for $G$. We have that each $G_{i+1}$ is normal in $G_i$ and the\nfactor group $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is abelian. Because $G$ is a torsion group,\nso is the factor group $G_i/G_{i+1}$. Clearly an abelian torsion group\nis locally finite. By applying the fact in the previous paragraph for\neach step in the composition series, we see that $G$ must be locally\nfinite.\n\n[9]{} E. S.
