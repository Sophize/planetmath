  "definition": "Using the notation in the entry Group Cohomology, a 2-cocycle or *factor\nsystem* is a map $\\phi:G\\times G{\\rightarrow}M$ such that for all\n$\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\in G$, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha\\phi(\\beta,\\gamma)-\\phi(\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma)+\\phi(\\alpha,\\beta\\gamma)-\\phi(\\beta,\\gamma)=0.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFactor systems play a role in determing classes of group extensions of\n$G$ by $M$ in the case where $M$ is taken to be an abelian normal\nsubgroup of $G$.",
