  "definition": "A *presentation* of a group $G$ is a description of $G$ in terms of\ngenerators and relations (sometimes also known as relators). We say that\nthe group is finitely presented, if it can be described in terms of a\nfinite number of generators and a finite number of defining relations. A\ncollection of group elements $g_i\\in G,\\;i\\in I$ is said to generate $G$\nif every element of $G$ can be specified as a product of the $g_i$, and\nof their inverses. A relation is a word over the alphabet consisting of\nthe generators $g_i$ and their inverses, with the property that it\nmultiplies out to the identity in $G$. A set of relations $r_j,\\;\nj\\in J$ is said to be defining, if all relations in $G$ can be given as\na product of the $r_j$, their inverses, and the $G$-conjugates of these.\n\nThe standard notation for the presentation of a group is\n$$G= \\langle g_i \\mid r_j \\rangle,$$ meaning that $G$ is generated by\ngenerators $g_i$, subject to relations $r_j$. Equivalently, one has a\nshort exact sequence of groups $$1 \\to N \\to F[I] \\to G\\to 1,$$ where\n$F[I]$ denotes the free group generated by the $g_i$, and where $N$ is\nthe smallest normal subgroup containing all the $r_j$. By the\nNielsen-Schreier Theorem, the kernel $N$ is itself a free group, and\nhence we assume without loss of generality that there are no relations\namong the relations.\n\n[**Example.**]{} The symmetric group on $n$ elements $1,\\ldots, n$\nadmits the following finite presentation (Note: this presentation is not\ncanonical. Other presentations are known.) As generators take\n$$g_i=(i, i+1),\\quad i=1,\\ldots, n-1,$$ the transpositions of adjacent\nelements. As defining relations take\n$$(g_i g_j)^{n_{i,j}} = \\mathrm{id},\\quad i,j=1,\\ldots n,$$ where\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  n_{i,i} &= 1 \\\\\n  n_{i,i+1} &= 3 \\\\\n  n_{i,j} &=2,\\quad \\vert j-i \\vert > 1.\\end{aligned}$$ This means that\na finite symmetric group is a Coxeter group.",
