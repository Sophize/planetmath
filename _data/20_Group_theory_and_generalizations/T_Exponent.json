  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group with the that there exists a positive integer $n$\nsuch that, for every $g \\in G$, $g^n=e_G$. The [*exponent*]{} of $G$,\ndenoted $\\operatorname{exp}~G$, is the smallest positive integer $m$\nsuch that, for every $g \\in G$, $g^m=e_G$. Thus, for every finite group\n$G$, $\\operatorname{exp}~G$ divides $|G|$. Also, for every group $G$\nthat has an exponent and for every $g \\in G$, $|g|$ divides\n$\\operatorname{exp}~G$.\n\nThe concept of exponent for finite groups is to that of for finite\nfields.\n\nIf $G$ is a finite abelian group, then there exists $g \\in G$ with\n$|g|=\\operatorname{exp}~G$. As a result of the , there exist\n$a_1, \\ldots , a_n$ with $a_i$ dividing $a_{i+1}$ for every integer $i$\nbetween 1 and $n$ such that\n$G \\cong {\\mathbb Z}_{a_1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus {\\mathbb Z}_{a_n}$.\nSince, for every $c \\in G$, $c^{a_n}=e_G$, then\n$\\operatorname{exp}~G \\le a_n$. Since $|(0, \\ldots , 0, 1)|=a_n$, it\nfollows that $\\operatorname{exp}~G=a_n$.\n\nFollowing are some examples of exponents of finite nonabelian groups.\n\nSince $|(1 2)|=2$, $|(1 2 3)|=3$, and $|S_3|=6$, it follows that\n$\\operatorname{exp}~S_3=6$.\n\nIn $Q_8=\\{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\\}$, the ring of quaternions of\norder eight, since $|i|=|-i|=|j|=|-j|=|k|=|-k|=4$ and $1^4=(-1)^4=1$, it\nfollows that $\\operatorname{exp}~Q_8=4$.\n\nSince the order of a product of two disjoint transpositions is 2, the\norder of a three cycle is 3, and the only nonidentity elements of $A_4$\nare three cycles and products of two disjoint transpositions, it follows\nthat $\\operatorname{exp}~A_4=6$.\n\nSince $|(1 2 3)|=3$ and $|(1 2 3 4)|=4$,\n$\\operatorname{exp}~S_4 \\ge 12$. Since $S_4$ has no elements of order 8,\nit cannot have an element of order 24. It follows that\n$\\operatorname{exp}~S_4=12$.\n\nFollowing are some examples of exponents of infinite groups.\n\nClearly, any infinite group that has an element of infinite order does\nnot have an exponent. On the other hand, just because an infinite group\nhas the that every element has finite order does not that the group has\nan exponent. As an example, consider $G=\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$, which is\na group under addition. Despite that all of its elements have finite\norder, $G$ does not have an exponent. This is because, for every\npositive integer $n$, $G$ has an element of order $n$, namely\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n}+\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nOn the other hand, some infinite groups have exponents. For example, let\n$\\mathbb{F}_2$ denote the field having two elements. Then\n$\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$, the ring of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients\nin $\\mathbb{F}_2$, is an abelian group under addition. Moreover, it is\nan infinite group; however, every nonzero element has order $2$. Thus,\n$\\operatorname{exp}~\\mathbb{F}_2[x]=2$.",
