  "statement": "If $G$ is a group (or ring, or module) and $H$ and $K$ are normal\nsubgroups (or ideals, or submodules, respectively) of $G$, with\n$H\\subseteq K$, then there is a natural isomorphism\n$(G/H)/(K/H)\\cong G/K$.\n\nThis is usually known either as the Third Isomorphism Theorem, or as the\nSecond Isomorphism Theorem (depending on the order in which the theorems\nare introduced). It is also occasionally called the Freshman Theorem.",
