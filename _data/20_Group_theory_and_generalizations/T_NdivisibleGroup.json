  "definition": "Let $n$ be a positive integer and $G$ an abelian group. An element\n$x\\in G$ is said to be divisible by $n$ if there is $y\\in G$ such that\n$x=ny$.\n\nBy the unique factorization of $\\mathbb{Z}$, write\n$n=p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2}\\cdots p_k^{m_k}$ where each $p_i$ is a prime\nnumber (distinct from one another) and $m_i$ a positive integer.\n\nIf $x$ is divisible by $n$, then $x$ is divisible by\n$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$.\n\nIf $x$ is divisible by $n$, write $x=ny$, where $y\\in G$. Since $p_i$\ndivides $n$, write $n=p_it_i$ where $t_i$ is a positive integer. Then\n$x=p_it_i(y)=p_i(t_iy)$. Since $t_iy\\in G$, $x$ is divisible by $p_i$.\n\n**Definition**. An abelian group $G$ such that every element is\ndivisible by $n$ is called an $n$-divisible group. Clearly, every group\nis $1$-divisible.\n\nFor example, the subset $D\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ of all decimal fractions\nis $10$-divisible. $D$ is also $2$ and $5$-divisible. In general, we\nhave the following:\n\nIf $G$ is $n$-divisible, it is also $n^s$-divisible for every\nnon-negative integer $s$.\n\nSuppose $p$ and $q$ are coprime, then $G$ is $p$-divisible and\n$q$-divisible iff it is $pq$-divisible.\n\nThis follows from proposition 1 and the fact that if $p|n$, $q|n$ and\n$\\gcd(p,q)=1$, then $pq|n$.\n\n$G$ is $n$-divisible iff $G$ is $p$-divisible for every prime $p$\ndividing $n$.\n\nSuppose $G$ is $n$-divisible. By proposition 1, every element $x\\in G$\nis divisible by $p$, so that $G$ is $p$-divisible. Conversely, suppose\n$G$ is $p$-divisible for every $p|n$. Write\n$n=p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2}\\cdots p_k^{m_k}$. Then if $G$ is\n$p_i^{m_i}$-divisible for every $i=1,\\ldots, k$. Since $p_i^{m_i}$ and\n$p_j^{m_j}$ are coprime, $G$ is $n$-divisible by induction and\nproposition 3.\n\n**Remark**. $G$ is a divisible group iff $G$ is $p$-divisible for every\nprime $p$.",
