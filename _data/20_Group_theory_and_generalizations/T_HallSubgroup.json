  "definition": "Let $G$ be a finite group. A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be a *Hall\nsubgroup* if $$\\gcd (|H|,|G/H|)=1.$$ In other words, $H$ is a Hall\nsubgroup if the order of $H$ and its index in $G$ are coprime. These\nsubgroups are name after Philip Hall who used them to characterize\nsolvable groups.\n\nHall subgroups are a generalization of Sylow subgroups. Indeed, every\nSylow subgroup is a Hall subgroup. According to Sylow\u2019s theorem, this\nmeans that any group of order $p^k m$, $\\gcd(p,m)=1$, has a Hall\nsubgroup (of order $p^k$).\n\nA common notation used with Hall subgroups is to use the notion of .\nHere $\\pi$ is a set of primes and a Hall $\\pi$-subgroup of a group is a\nsubgroup which is also a $\\pi$-group, and maximal with this property.\n\nA finite group $G$ is solvable iff $G$ has a Hall $\\pi$-subgroup for any\nset of primes $\\pi$.\n\nThe sets of primes $\\pi$ in Hall\u2019s theorem can be restricted to the\nsubsets of primes which divide $|G|$. However, this result fails for\nnon-solvable groups.\n\nThe group $A_5$ has no Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup. That is, $A_5$ has no\nsubgroup of order $20$.\n\nSuppose that $A_5$ has a Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup $H$. As $|A_5|=60$, it\nfollows that $|H|=20$. Thus, there are three cosets of $H$. Since a\ngroup always acts on the cosets of a subgroup, it follows that $A_5$\nacts on the three member set $C$ of cosets of $H$. This induces a\nnon-trivial homomorphism from $A_5$ to $S_C\\cong S_3$ (here, $S_C$ is\nthe symmetric group on $C$, see for more detail). Since $A_5$ is simple,\nthis homomorphism must be one-to-one, implying that its image must have\norder at most $6$, an impossibility.\n\nThis example can also be proved by direct inspection of the subgroups of\n$A_5$. In any case, $A_5$ is non-abelian simple and therefore it is not\na solvable group. Thus, Hall\u2019s theorem does not apply to $A_5$.",
