  "statement": "**Theorem.** The identity element of a monoid is unique.\\\n[*Proof.*]{} Let $e$ and $e'$ be identity elements of a monoid\n$(G,\\,\\cdot)$. Since $e$ is an identity element, one has\n$e\\!\\cdot\\!e' = e'$. Since $e'$ is an identity element, one has also\n$e\\!\\cdot\\!e' = e$. Thus $$e' \\;=\\; e\\!\\cdot\\!e' \\;=\\; e,$$ i.e. both\nidentity elements are the same (in inferring this result from the two\nfirst equations, one has used the and transitivity of the equality\nrelation).\\\n**Note.** The theorem also proves the uniqueness of e.g. the identity\nelement of a group, the 0 of a ring or a field, and the 1 of a field.",
