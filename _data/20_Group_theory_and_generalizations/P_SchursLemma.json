  "statement": "Schur\u2019s lemma is a fundamental result in representation theory, an\nelementary observation about irreducible modules, which is nonetheless\nnoteworthy because of its profound applications.\n\nLet $G$ be a finite group and let $V$ and $W$ be irreducible\n$G$-modules. Then, every $G$-module homomorphism $f: V \\to W$ is either\ninvertible or the trivial zero map.\n\nNote that both the kernel, $\\ker f$, and the image,\n${\\operatorname{im}}f$, are $G$-submodules of $V$ and $W$, respectively.\nSince $V$ is irreducible, $\\ker f$ is either trivial or all of $V$. In\nthe former case, ${\\operatorname{im}}f$ is all of $W$ \u2014 also because $W$\nis irreducible \u2014 and hence $f$ is invertible. In the latter case, $f$ is\nthe zero map.\n\nOne of the most important consequences of Schur\u2019s lemma is the\nfollowing.\n\nLet $V$ be a finite-dimensional, irreducible $G$-module taken over an\nalgebraically closed field. Then, every $G$-module homomorphism\n$f: V \\to V$ is equal to a scalar multiplication.\n\nSince the ground field is algebraically closed, the linear\ntransformation $f: V\\to V$ has an eigenvalue; call it $\\lambda$. By\ndefinition, $f - \\lambda 1$ is not invertible, and hence equal to zero\nby Schur\u2019s lemma. In other words, $f = \\lambda$, a scalar.",
