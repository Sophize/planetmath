  "definition": "If a ring $(R,\\,+,\\,\\cdot)$ left identity element $e$, i.e. if\n$$e\\cdot a = a \\quad \\forall a,$$ then $e$ is called the [*left\nunity*]{} of $R$.\n\nIf a ring $R$ right identity element $e'$, i.e. if\n$$a\\cdot e' = a \\quad \\forall a,$$ then $e'$ is called the [*right\nunity*]{} of $R$.\n\nA ring may have several left or right unities (see e.g. the Klein\nfour-ring).\n\nIf a ring $R$ has both a left unity $e$ and a right unity $e'$, then\nthey must coincide, since $$e' = e\\cdot e' = e.$$ This situation means\nthat every right unity equals to $e$, likewise every left unity. Then we\nspeak simply of a unity of the ring.",
