  "statement": "Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup and $T$ transversal of $H$ in $G$.\nFor every $g\\in G$, we denote by $\\bar{g}$ the unique element $t\\in T$\nsuch that $Hg=Ht$. We also insist that $1\\in T$. Under these conditions\nwe can state Schreier\u2019s lemma.\n\n\\[lem:schreier\\] Given a group $G=\\langle S\\rangle$, a subgroup $H$, and\ntransversal $T$ for $G/H$, then the set\n$$U=H{\\cap}\\{ts(\\overline{ts})^{-1}~:~s\\in S,t\\in T\\}$$ generates $H$.\n\n[@Seress] We show that $H$ is generated by $U{\\cup}U^{-1}$. We already\nknow $U$ is contained in $H$ and we know every element $h\\in H$ is\nexpressible as a word over $S$, as $S$ generates $G$. So\n$h=s_1\\cdots s_k$ where $s_i\\in S{\\cup}S^{-1}$. Note that\n$h=1s_1\\cdots s_k$ which is of the form\n$u_1\\cdots u_i t_{i+1}s_{i+1}\\cdots s_k$ for $u_j\\in U{\\cup}U^{-1}$,\n$t_{i+1}\\in T$ and $s_j\\in S{\\cup}S^{-1}$, where $i=0$. We assume for\ninduction that $h$ has this form for some $i$. Now we perform the\nsleight-of-hand. $$\\begin{aligned}\nh & = & u_1\\cdots u_i t_{i+1}s_{i+1}\\cdots s_k\\\\\n    & = & u_1\\cdots u_i t_{i+1}s_{i+1}\n    (\\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}})^{-1}(\\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}})s_{i+2}\\cdots s_k\\\\\n    & = & u_1\\cdots u_i (t_{i+1}s_{i+1}(\\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}})^{-1})\n        \\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}}s_{i+2}\\cdots s_k\\\\\n    & = & u_1\\cdots u_i u_{i+1}t_{i+2}s_{i+2}\\cdots s_k\\end{aligned}$$\nby letting $u_{i+1}=t_{i+1}s_{i+1}(\\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}})^{-1}$\nwhich is in $U{\\cup}U^{-1}$, and\n$t_{i+2}=\\overline{t_{i+1}s_{i+1}}\\in T$. At the end of the iteration we\nhave replaced all the $s_i$\u2019s with elements of $U{\\cup}U^{-1}$ and the\nlast element $t_{k}\\in T$. However, $U$ lies in $H$ so the product\n$u_1\\cdots u_k\\in H$ and as $h\\in H$ and $h=u_1\\cdots u_kt_k$ we know\n$t_k\\in H$. As $Ht_k=H$, and $t_k\\in T$ we now use the fact that\n$1\\in T$ to assert that $t_k=1$. So $h$ is a word in $U{\\cup}U^{-1}$ and\nthus $U$ generates $H$.\n\nThe lemma was discovered in the course of studying free groups as a way\nto produce generators for a subgroup of a free group. The\nReidemeister-Schreier theorem strengthened this result to produce a\npresentation for $H$ given one for $G$ and a transversal of $G/H$.\n\nThe lemma lead to an unexpected use in the 1970\u2019s where it was\nrediscovered by various authors to solve certain problems in\ncomputational group theory. Sims used the result to find generators of\nthe stabilizer of a point in a permutation group. This method could then\nbe repeated to find generators for each stabilizer in a stabilizer chain\nof a base of the group. A naive approach can result in exponentially\nmany generators, so Sims\u2019 algorithm additionally removes unnecessary\ngenerators along the way. This is now called the Schreier-Sims\nalgorithm.\n\nIndependently a version of this algorithm was developed by Frust,\nHopcroft, and Luks as a means to prove the polynomial-time complexity of\nvarious problems in finite group theory and graph theory. Many\nimprovements followed including versions by Knuth, Jerum, and even a\nprobabilistic nearly linear time method by Seress.\n\nThe lemma still finds use in non-finite groups as Schreier had intended.\nThe associated algorithms have been repeatedly improved principally by\nthe work of George Havas and Colin Ramsay.\n\n[10]{}\n\nSeress, [\u00c1]{}kos *Permutation group algorithms*, Cambridge Tracts in\nMathematics, vol. 152, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2003.",
