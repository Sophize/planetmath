  "definition": "A *Chernikov group* is a group $G$ that has a normal subgroup $N$ such\nthat $G/N$ is finite and $N$ is a direct product of finitely many\nquasicyclic groups.\n\nThe significance of this somewhat arbitrary-looking definition is that\nall such groups satisfy the minimal condition, and for a long time they\nwere the only known groups with this property.\n\nChernikov groups are named after , who proved that every solvable group\nthat satisfies the minimal condition is a Chernikov group. We can state\nthis result in the form of the following theorem.\n\nThe following are equivalent for a group $G$:\n\n-   $G$ is a Chernikov group.\n\n-   $G$ is virtually abelian and satisfies the minimal condition.\n\n-   $G$ is virtually solvable and satisfies the minimal condition.",
