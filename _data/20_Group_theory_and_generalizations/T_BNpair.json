  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group. Then $G$ has a $BN$-pair or a Tits system if the\nfollowing conditions hold:\n\n1.  $B$ and $N$ are subgroups of $G$ such that $G=<B,N>$.\n\n2.  $B\\cap N =T \\triangleleft N$ and $N/T=W$ is a group generated by a\n    set $S$.\n\n3.  $sBw \\subseteq BwB \\cup BswB$ for all $s\\in S$ and $w\\in W$.\n\n4.  $sBs^{-1} \\not\\subseteq B$ for all $s\\in S$.\n\nWhere $BwB$ is a double coset with respect to $B$. It can be proven that\n$S$ is in fact made up of elements of order 2, and that $W$ is a Coxeter\ngroup.\n\n[**Example:**]{} Let $G=GL_n(\\mathbb{K})$ where $\\mathbb{K}$ is some\nfield. Then, if we let $B$ be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices\nand $N$ be the subgroup of monomial matrices (i.e. matrices having one\nnonzero entry in each row and each column, or more precisely the\nstabilizer of the lines $\\{[e_1],...,[e_n]\\}$). Then, it can be shown\nthat $B$ and $N$ generate $G$ and that $T$ is the subgroup of diagonal\nmatrices. In turn, it follows that $W$ in this case is isomorphic to the\nsymmetric group on $n$ letters, $S_n$.\n\nFor more, consult chapter 5 in the book Buildings, by Kenneth Brown",
