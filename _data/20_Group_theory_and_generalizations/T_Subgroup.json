Then $K$ is a\nsubgroup of $G$ defined under the same operation if $K$ is a group by\nitself (with respect to $*$), that is:\n\n-   $K$ is closed under the $*$ operation.\n\n-   There exists an identity element $e\\in K$ such that for all\n    $k \\in K$, $k*e = k = e*k$.\n\n-   Let $k \\in K$ then there exists an inverse $k^{-1} \\in K$ such that\n    $k^{-1}*k = e = k*k^{-1}$.\n\nThe subgroup is denoted likewise $(K,*)$. We denote $K$ being a subgroup\nof $G$ by writing $K\\leq G$.\\\nIn addition the notion of a subgroup of a semigroup can be defined in\nthe following manner. Let $(S,*)$ be a semigroup and $H$ be a subset of\n$S$. Then $H$ is a subgroup of $S$ if $H$ is a subsemigroup of $S$ and\n$H$ is a group.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n-   The set $\\{e\\}$ whose only element is the identity is a subgroup of\n    any group. It is called the trivial subgroup.\n\n-   Every group is a subgroup of itself.\n\n-   The null set $\\{ \\}$ is never a subgroup (since the definition of\n    group states that the set must be non-empty).\n\nThere is a very useful theorem that allows proving a given subset is a\nsubgroup.\n\n**Theorem:**\\\nIf $K$ is a nonempty subset of the group $G$. Then $K$ is a *subgroup*\nof $G$ if and only if $s,t \\in K$ implies that $st^{-1} \\in K$.\n\n**Proof:** First we need to show if $K$ is a subgroup of $G$ then\n$st^{-1} \\in K$. Since $s,t \\in K$ then $st^{-1} \\in K$, because $K$ is\na group by itself.\\\nNow, suppose that if for any $s,t\\in K\\subseteq G$ we have\n$st^{-1}\\in K$. We want to show that $K$ is a subgroup, which we will\naccomplish by proving it holds the group axioms.\n\nSince $tt^{-1}\\in K$ by hypothesis, we conclude that the identity\nelement is in $K$: $e\\in K$. (Existence of identity)\n\nNow that we know $e\\in K$, for all $t$ in $K$ we have that\n$et^{-1}=t^{-1}\\in K$ so the inverses of elements in $K $ are also in\n$K$. (Existence of inverses).\n\nLet $s,t\\in K$. Then we know that $t^{-1}\\in K$ by last step. Applying\nhypothesis shows that $$s(t^{-1})^{-1} = st\\in K$$ so $K$ is closed\nunder the operation. $QED$",

  "remarks": "\n\n**Example:**\n\n-   Consider the group $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$. Show that$(2\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is\n    a subgroup.\n\n    The subgroup is closed under addition since the sum of even integers\n    is even.\n\n    The identity $0$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is also on $2\\mathbb{Z}$ since $2$\n    divides $0$. For every $k \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$ there is an\n    $-k \\in  2\\mathbb{Z}$ which is the inverse under addition and\n    satisfies $-k+k = 0 =\n      k+(-k)$. Therefore $(2\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a subgroup of\n    $(\\mathbb{Z},  +)$.\n\n    Another way to show $(2\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a subgroup is by using the\n    proposition stated above. If $s,t \\in\n      2\\mathbb{Z}$ then $s,t$ are even numbers and $s-t\\in\n      2\\mathbb{Z}$ since the difference of even numbers is always an\n    even number.\n\n**See also:**\n\n-   Wikipedia,",
