  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nLet $G$ be a group, and let $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$ be a family of of $G$. Then\n$G$ is said to be a *free product* of the subgroups $A_i$ if given any\ngroup $H$ and a $f_i\\colon A_i\\to H$ for each $i\\in I$, there is a\nunique homomorphism $f\\colon G\\to H$ such that $f|_{A_i}=f_i$ for all\n$i\\in I$. The subgroups $A_i$ are then called the *free factors* of $G$.\n\nIf $G$ is the free product of $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$, and $(K_i)_{i\\in I}$ is\na family of groups such that $K_i\\isomorphic A_i$ for each $i\\in I$,\nthen we may also say that $G$ is the free product of $(K_i)_{i\\in I}$.\nWith this definition, every family of groups has a free product, and the\nfree product is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nThe free product is the coproduct in the category of groups.\n\nConstruction {#construction .unnumbered}\n============\n\nFree groups are simply the free products of infinite cyclic groups, and\nit is possible to generalize the construction given in the free group\narticle to the case of arbitrary free products. But we will instead\nconstruct the free product as a of a free group.\n\nLet $(K_i)_{i\\in I}$ be a family of groups. For each $i\\in I$, let $X_i$\nbe a set and $\\gamma_i\\colon X_i\\to K_i$ a function such that\n$\\gamma_i(X_i)$ generates $K_i$. The $X_i$ should be chosen to be\npairwise disjoint; for example, we could take $X_i=K_i\\times\\{i\\}$, and\nlet $\\gamma_i$ be the obvious bijection. Let $F$ be a free group freely\ngenerated by $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}X_i$. For each $i\\in I$, the subgroup\n$\\genby{X_i}$ of $F$ is freely generated by $X_i$, so there is a\nhomomorphism $\\phi_i\\colon\\genby{X_i}\\to K_i$ extending $\\gamma_i$. Let\n$N$ be the normal closure of $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}\\ker{\\phi_i}$ in $F$.\n\nThen it can be shown that $F/N$ is the free product of the family of\nsubgroups $(\\genby{X_i}N/N)_{i\\in I}$, and\n$K_i\\isomorphic\\genby{X_i}N/N$ for each $i\\in I$.",
