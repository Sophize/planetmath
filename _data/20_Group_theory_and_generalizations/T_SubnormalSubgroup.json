Then $H$ is a *subnormal\nsubgroup* of $G$ if there is a natural number $n$ and subgroups\n$H_0,\\dots,H_n$ of $G$ such that\n$$H=H_0\\normal H_1\\normal\\cdots\\normal H_n=G,$$ where $H_i$ is a normal\nsubgroup of $H_{i+1}$ for $i=0,\\dots,n-1$.\n\nSubnormality is a , as normality of subgroups is not transitive.\n\nWe may write $H\\sn G$ or $H\\normal\\normal\\, G$ or\n$H\\!\\normaleq\\normaleq G$ to indicate that $H$ is a subnormal subgroup\nof $G$.\n\nIn a nilpotent group, all subgroups are subnormal.\n\nSubnormal subgroups are ascendant and descendant.",
