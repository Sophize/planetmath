  "definition": "Let $\\pi$ be a set of primes. A torsion group $G$ is called a\n$\\pi$-group if each prime dividing the order of an element of $G$ is in\n$\\pi$ and a $\\pi'$-group if none of them are. Typically, if $\\pi$ is a\nsingleton $\\pi=\\{p\\}$, we write $p$-group and $p'$-group for these.\n\n**Remark**. If $G$ is finite, then $G$ is a $\\pi$-group if every prime\ndividing $|G|$ is in $\\pi$.",
