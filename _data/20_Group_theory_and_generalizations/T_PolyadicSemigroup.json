  "definition": "Recall that a semigroup is a non-empty set, together with an associative\nbinary operation on it. *Polyadic semigroups* are generalizations of\nsemigroups, in that the associative binary operation is replaced by an\nassociative $n$-ary operation. More precisely, we have\n\n**Definition**. Let $n$ be a positive integer at least $2$. A\n*$n$-semigroup* is a non-empty set $S$, together with an $n$-ary\noperation $f$ on $S$, such that $f$ is associative:\n$$f(f(a_1,\\ldots, a_n),a_{n+1},\\ldots, a_{2n-1})=f(a_1,\\ldots, f(a_i,\\ldots, a_{i+n-1}), \\ldots, f_{2n-1})$$\nfor every $i\\in \\lbrace 1,\\ldots, n\\rbrace$. A *polyadic semigroup* is\nan $n$-semigroup for some $n$.\n\nAn $n$-semigroup $S$ (with the associated $n$-ary operation $f$) is said\nto be *commutative* if $f$ is commutative. An element $e\\in S$ is said\nto be an *identity element*, or an *$f$-identity*, if\n$$f(a, e, \\ldots, e)=f(e,a,\\ldots,e)=\\cdots = f(e,e,\\ldots,a) = a$$ for\nall $a\\in S$. If $S$ is commutative, then $e$ is an identity in $S$ if\n$f(a,e,\\ldots,e)=a$.\n\nEvery semigroup $S$ has an $n$-semigroup structure: define $f:S^n\\to S$\nby $$f(a_1,a_n\\ldots,a_n)=a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdots \\cdot a_n$$ The\nassociativity of $f$ is induced from the associativity of $\\cdot$.\n\n**Definition**. An $n$-semigroup $S$ is called an *$n$-group* if, in the\nequation $$f(x_1,\\ldots, x_n)=a,$$ any $n-1$ of the $n$ variables $x_i$\nare replaced by elements of $G$, then the equation with the remaining\none variable has *at least one* solution in that variable. A *polyadic\ngroup* is just an $n$-group for some integer $n$.\n\n$n$-groups are generalizations of groups. Indeed, a $2$-group is just a\ngroup.\n\nLet $G$ be a $2$-group. For $a,b\\in G$, we write $ab$ instead of\n$f(a,b)$. Given $a\\in G$, there are $e_1,e_2\\in G$ such that $ae_1=a$\nand $e_2a=a$. In addition, there are $x,y\\in G$ such that $xa=e_2$ and\n$ay=e_1$. So\n$e_2=xa = x(ae_1)=(xa)e_1= e_2e_1=e_2(ay)=(e_2a)y=ay = e_1$.\n\nNext, suppose $ae_1=ae_3=a$. Then the equation $e_2a=a$ from the\nprevious paragraph as well as the subsequent discussion shows that\n$e_1=e_2=e_3$. This means that, for every $a\\in G$, there is a unique\n$e_a\\in G$ such that $e_a a =a e_a =a$. Since\n$e_a^2 a = e_a (e_a a)=e_a a = a = a e_a = (a e_a) e_a  = a e_a^2$, we\nsee that $e_a$ is idempotent: $e_a^2=e_a$.\n\nNow, pick any $b\\in G$. Then there is $c\\in G$ such that $b=ce_a$. So\n$be_a = (c e_a)e_a = c e_a^2= ce_a = b$. From the last two paragraphs,\nwe see that $e_a = e_b$. This shows that there is a $e\\in G$ such that\n$ae=ea=a$ for all $a\\in G$. In other words, $e$ is the identity with\nrespect to the binary operation $f$.\n\nFinally, given $a\\in G$, there are $b,c\\in G$ such that $ab=ca=e$. Then\n$c = ce = c(ab)= (ca)b=eb = b$. In addition, if $ab_1=ab_2=e$, then,\nfrom the equation $ca=e$, we get $b_1=c=b_2$. This shows $b$ is the\nunique inverse of $a$ with respect to binary operation $f$. Hence, $G$\nis a group.\n\nEvery group has a structure of an $n$-group, where the $n$-ary operation\n$f$ on $G$ is defined by the equation (1) above. Interestingly, Post has\nproved that, for every $n$-group $G$, there is a group $H$, and an\ninjective function $\\phi:G\\to H$ with the following properties:\n\n1.  $\\phi(G)$ generates $H$\n\n2.  $\\phi(f(a_1,\\ldots,a_n))=\\phi(a_1)\\cdots \\phi(a_n)$\n\nIf we call the group $H$ with the two above properties a *covering\ngroup* of $G$, then Post\u2019s theorem states that every $n$-group has a\ncovering group.\n\nFrom Post\u2019s result, one has the following corollary: an $n$-semigroup\n$G$ is an $n$-group iff equation (2) above has *exactly one* solution in\nthe remaining variable, when $n-1$ of the $n$ variables are replaced by\nelements of $G$.\n\n[0]{} R.
