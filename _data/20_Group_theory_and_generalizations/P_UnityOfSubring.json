  "statement": "Let $S$ be a proper subring of the ring $R$. If $S$ has a non-zero unity\n$u$ which is not unity of $R$, then $u$ is a zero divisor of $R$.\n\n[*Proof.*]{} Because $u$ is not unity of $R$, there exists an element\n$r$ of $R$ such that $ru \\neq r$. Then we have $(ru)u = r(uu) = ru$,\nwhich implies that $0 = (ru)u-ru = (ru-r)\\cdot u$. Since neither $ru-r$\nnor $u$ is 0, the element $u$ is a zero divisor in $R$.",
