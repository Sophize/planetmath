  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group.\n\nA subset $X\\subseteq G$ is said to *generate* $G$ (or to be a\n*generating set* of $G$) if no proper subgroup of $G$ contains $X$.\n\nA subset $X\\subseteq G$ generates $G$ if and only if every element of\n$G$ can be expressed as a product of elements of $X$ and inverses of\nelements of $X$ (taking the empty product to be the identity element). A\nsubset $X\\subseteq G$ is said to be *closed under inverses* if\n$x^{-1}\\in X$ whenever $x\\in X$; if a generating set $X$ of $G$ is\nclosed under inverses, then every element of $G$ is a product of\nelements of $X$.\n\nA group that has a generating set with only one element is called a\ncyclic group. A group that has a generating set with only finitely many\nelements is called a finitely generated group.\n\nIf $X$ is an arbitrary subset of $G$, then the subgroup of $G$\n*generated by* $X$, denoted by $\\genby{X}$, is the smallest subgroup of\n$G$ that contains $X$.\n\nThe *generating rank* of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a generating\nset of $G$. (This is sometimes just called the *rank* of $G$, but this\ncan cause confusion with other meanings of the term [*rank*]{}.) If $G$\nis uncountable, then its generating rank is simply $|G|$.",
