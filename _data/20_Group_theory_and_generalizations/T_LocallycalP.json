A group $G$ is said to be *locally\n$\\cal P$* if every nontrivial finitely generated subgroup of $G$ has\nproperty $\\cal P$.\n\nFor example, the locally infinite groups are precisely the torsion-free\ngroups. Other classes of groups defined this way include locally finite\ngroups and locally cyclic groups.",
