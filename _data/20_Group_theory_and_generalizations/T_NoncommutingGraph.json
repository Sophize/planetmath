  "definition": "Let $G$ be a non-abelian group with center $Z(G)$. Associate a graph\n$\\Gamma_G$ with $G$ whose vertices are the non-central elements\n$G\\setminus Z(G)$ and whose edges join those vertices $x,y\\in\nG\\setminus Z(G)$ for which $xy\\neq yx$. Then $\\Gamma_G$ is said to be\nthe *non-commuting graph* of $G$. The non-commuting graph $\\Gamma_G$ was\nfirst considered by Paul Erd\u00f6s, when he posed the following problem in\n1975 \\[B.H. Neumann, [*A problem of Paul Erd\u00f6s on groups,*]{} J.\nAustral. Math. Soc. Ser. A [**21**]{} (1976), 467-472\\]:\\\nLet $G$ be a group whose non-commuting graph has no infinite complete\nsubgraph. Is it true that there is a finite bound on the cardinalities\nof complete subgraphs of $\\Gamma_G$?\\\nB. H. Neumann answered positively Erd\u00f6s\u2019 question.\\\nThe non-commuting graph $\\Gamma_G$ of a non-abelian group $G$ is always\nconnected with diameter 2 and girth 3. It is also Hamiltonian.\n$\\Gamma_G$ is planar if and only if $G$ is isomphic to the symmetric\ngroup $S_3$, or the dihedral group ${\\mathcal}{D}_8$ of order $8$ or the\nquaternion group $Q_8$ of order $8$.\\\nSee \\[Alireza Abdollahi, S. Akbari and H.R. Maimani, [*Non-commuting\ngraph of a group*]{}, Journal of Algbera, [**298**]{} (2006) 468-492.\\]\nfor proofs of these properties of $\\Gamma_G$.\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n--------\n\n### Symmetric group $S_3$ {#symmetric-group-s_3 .unnumbered}\n\nThe symmetric group $S_3$ is the smallest non-abelian group. In cycle\nnotation, we have $$S_3=\\{(),(12),(13),(23),(123),(132)\\}.$$ The center\nis trivial: $Z(S_3)=\\{()\\}$. The non-commuting graph in\nFigure\u00a0\\[fig:s3\\] contains all possible edges except one.\n\n\\[fig:s3\\]\n\n![Non-commuting graph of the symmetric group\n$S_3$](NonCommutingGraphOfAGroup.s3.eps)\n\n### Octic group {#octic-group .unnumbered}\n\nThe dihedral group ${\\mathcal}{D}_8$, generally known as the octic\ngroup, is the symmetry group of the . If you label the vertices of the\nsquare from $1$ to $4$ going along the edges, the octic group may be\nseen as a of the symmetric group $S_4$:\n$${\\mathcal}{D}_8:=\\{(),(13),(24),(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23),(1234),(1432)\\}.$$\nSo the octic group has $8$ (hence its name), and its center consists of\nthe identity element and the simultaneous flip around both diagonals\n$(13)(24)$. Its non-commuting graph is given in Figure\u00a0\\[fig:d4\\].\n\n\\[fig:d4\\]\n\n![Non-commuting graph of the octic\ngroup](NonCommutingGraphOfAGroup.d4.eps)",
