  "definition": "Let $G,H$ be . An *isotopy* $\\phi$ from $G$ to $H$ is an ordered triple:\n$\\phi=(f,g,h)$, of bijections from $G$ to $H$, such that\n$$f(a)g(b)=h(ab)\\qquad \\mbox{for all } a,b\\in G.$$ $H$ is called an\n*isotope* of $G$ (or $H$ is *isotopic* to $G$) if there is an isotopy\n$\\phi:G\\to H$.\n\nSome easy examples of isotopies:\n\n1.  If $f:G\\to H$ is an isomorphism, $(f,f,f):G\\to H$ is an isotopy. By\n    abuse of language, we write $f=(f,f,f)$. In particular,\n    $(1_G,1_G,1_G):G\\to G$ is an isotopy.\n\n2.  If $\\phi=(f,g,h):G\\to H$ is an isotopy, then so is\n    $$\\phi^{-1}:=(f^{-1},g^{-1},h^{-1}):H\\to G,$$ for if $f^{-1}(a)=c$\n    and $g^{-1}(b)=d$, then $ab=f(c)g(d)=h(cd)$, so that\n    $f^{-1}(a)g^{-1}(b)=cd=h^{-1}(ab)$\n\n3.  If $\\phi=(f,g,h):G\\to H$ and $\\gamma=(r,s,t):H\\to K$ are isotopies,\n    then so is\n    $$\\gamma\\circ \\phi:=(r\\circ f, s\\circ g, t\\circ h):G\\to K,$$ for\n    $(r\\circ f)(a)(s\\circ g)(b)=r(f(a))s(g(b))=t(f(a)g(b))=t(h(ab))=(t\\circ h)(ab)$.\n\nFrom the examples above, it is easy to see that \u201cgroupoids being\nisotopic\u201d on the class of groupoids is an equivalence relation, and that\nan isomorphism class is contained in an isotopic class. In fact, the\ncontainment is strict. For an example of non-isomorphic isotopic\ngroupoids, see the reference below. However, if $G$ is a groupoid with\nunity and $G$ is isotopic to a semigroup $S$, then it is isomorphic to\n$S$. Other conditions making isotopic groupoids isomorphic can be found\nin the reference below.\n\nAn isotopy of the form $(f,g,1_H):G\\to H$ is called a *principal\nisotopy*, where $1_H$ is the identity function on $H$. $H$ is called a\n*principal isotope* of $G$. If $H$ is isotopic to $G$, then $H$ is\nisomorphic to a principal isotope $K$ of $G$.\n\nSuppose $(f,g,h):G\\to H$ is an isotopy. To construct $K$, start with\nelements of $G$, which will form the underlying set of $K$. The binary\noperation on $K$ is defined by\n$$a\\cdot b:= (f^{-1}\\circ h)(a)(g^{-1}\\circ h)(b).$$ Then $\\cdot$ is\nwell-defined, since $f,g$ are bijective, for all pairs of elements of\n$G$. Hence $K$ is a groupoid. Furthermore,\n$(f^{-1}\\circ h,g^{-1}\\circ h,1_K):G\\to K$ is an isotopy by definition,\nso that $K$ is a principal isotope of $G$. Finally,\n$h(a\\cdot b)=h(f^{-1}(h(a))g^{-1}(h(b)))=f(f^{-1}(h(a)))g(g^{-1}(h(b)))=h(a)h(b)$,\nshowing that $h:K\\to H$ is a bijective homomorphism, and hence an\nisomorphism.\n\n**Remark**. In the literature, the definition of an isotope is sometimes\nlimited to quasigroups. However, this is not necessary, as the follow\nproposition suggests:\n\nAny isotope of a quasigroup is a quasigroup.\n\nSuppose $(f,g,h):G\\to H$ is an isotopy, and $G$ a quasigroup. Pick\n$x,z\\in H$. Let $a,c\\in G$ be such that $f(a)=x$ and $h(c)=z$. Let\n$b\\in G$ be such that $ab=c$. Set $y=g(b)\\in H$. Then\n$xy=f(a)g(b)=h(ab)=h(c)=z$. Similarly, there is $t\\in H$ such that\n$tx=z$. Hence $H$ is a quasigroup.\n\nOn the other hand, an isotope of a loop may not be a loop. Nevertheless,\nwe sometimes say that an isotope of a loop $L$ as a loop isotopic to\n$L$.\n\n[9]{} R. H. Bruck: [*A Survey of Binary Systems*]{}. Springer-Verlag.\nNew York (1966).",
