  "definition": "An $n\\times n$ square matrix over a field is *unimodular* if its\ndeterminant is 1. The set of all $n\\times n$ unimodular matrices forms a\ngroup under the usual matrix multiplication. This group is known as the\nspecial linear group. Any of its subgroup is simply called a *unimodular\ngroup*. Furthermore, unimodularity is preserved under similarity\ntransformations: if $S$ any $n\\times n$ invertible matrix and $U$ is\nunimodular, then $S^{-1}US$ is unimodular. In view of the last\nstatement, the special linear group is a normal subgroup of the group of\nall invertible matrices, known as the general linear group.\n\nA linear transformation $T$ over an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$\n(over a field $F$) is *unimodular* if it can be represented by a\nunimodular matrix.\n\nThe concept of the unimodularity of a square matrix over a field can be\nreadily extended to that of a square matrix over a commutative ring.\nUnimodularity in square matrices can even be extended to arbitrary\nfinite-dimensional matrices: suppose $R$ is a commutative ring with 1,\nand $M$ is an $m\\times n$ matrix over $R$ (entries are elements of $R$)\nwith $m\\leq n$. Then $M$ is said to be *unimodular* if it can be\n\u201ccompleted\u201d to a $n\\times n$ square unimodular matrix $N$ over $R$. By\ncompletion of $M$ to $N$ we mean that $m$ of the $n$ rows in $N$ are\nexactly the rows of $M$. Of course, the operation of completion from a\nmatrix to a square matrix can be done via columns too.\n\nLet $M$ is an $m\\times n$ matrix and $v$ is any row of $M$. If $M$ is\nunimodular, then $v$ is unimodular viewed as a $1\\times n$ matrix. A\n$1\\times n$ unimodular matrix is called a *unimodular row*, or a\n*unimodular vector*. A $n\\times 1$ *unimodular column* can be defined\nvia a similar procedure. Let $v=(v_1,\\ldots,v_n)$ be a $1\\times n$\nmatrix over $R$. Then the unimodularity of $v$ means that\n$$v_1R+\\cdots+v_nR=R.$$ To see this, let $U$ be a completion of $v$ with\n$\\operatorname{det}(U)=1$. Since $\\operatorname{det}$ is a multilinear\noperator over the rows (or columns) of $U$, we see that\n$$1=\\operatorname{det}(U)=v_1r_1+\\cdots+v_nr_n.$$",
