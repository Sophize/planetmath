  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group and $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of $G$.\nElements of $L(G)$ can be ordered by the set inclusion relation\n$\\subseteq$. This way $L(G)$ becomes a partially ordered set.\n\nFor any $H,K\\in L(G)$, define $H\\wedge K$ by $H\\cap K$. Then $H\\wedge K$\nis a subgroup of $G$ and hence an element of $L(G)$. It is not hard to\nsee that $H \\wedge K$ is the largest subgroup of both $H$ and $K$.\n\nNext, let $X=H\\cup K$ and define $H\\vee K$ by $\\langle X\\rangle$, the\nsubgroup of $G$ generated by $X$. So $H\\vee K\\in L(G)$. Each element in\n$H\\vee K$ is a finite product of elements from $H$ and $K$. Again, it is\neasy to see that $H \\vee K$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that has $H$\nand $K$ as its subgroups.\n\nWith the two binary operations $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$, $L(G)$ becomes a\nlattice. It is a bounded lattice, with $G$ as the top element and\n$\\langle e \\rangle$ as the bottom element. Furthermore, if\n$\\lbrace H_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a set of subgroups of $G$ indexed by\nsome set $I$, then both\n$$\\bigwedge_{i\\in I} H_i\\qquad\\mbox{ and }\\qquad\\bigvee_{i\\in I} H_i$$\nare subgroups of $G$. So $L(G)$ is a complete lattice. From this, it is\neasy to produce a lattice which is not a subgroup lattice of any group.\n\nAtoms in $L(G)$, if they exist, are finite cyclic groups of prime order\n(or $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, where $p$ is a prime), since they have no\nnon-trivial proper subgroups.\n\n**Remark.** Finding lattices of subgroups of groups is one way to\nclassify groups. One of the main results in this branch of group theory\nstates that the lattice of subgroups of a group $G$ is iff $G$ is\nlocally cyclic.\n\nIt is generally not true that the lattice of subgroups of a group\ndetermines the group up to isomorphism. Already for groups of order\n$p^3$, $p>2$ or $p^4$, for all primes, there are examples of groups with\nsubgroup lattices which are not isomorphic groups.\n\n**Example.** Note that\n$\\operatorname{Aut }\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{p-1}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nTherefore it is possible to from a non-trivial semidirect product\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The lattice of subgroups of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the same as the lattice of\nsubgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$. However,\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is non-abelian while\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$ is abelian so the two groups are\nnot isomorphic.\n\nSimilarly, the groups $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^i}\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_p$ and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{p^i}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_p$ for any $i>2$ and any primes $p$\nalso have isomorphic subgroup lattices while one is non-abelian and the\nother abelian. So this is indeed a family of counterexamples.\n\nUpon inspecting these example it becomes clear that the non-abelian\ngroups have a different sublattice of normal subgroups. So the question\ncan be asked whether two groups with isomorphic subgroup lattices\nincluding matching up conjugacy classes (so even stronger than matching\nnormal subgroups) can be non-isomorphic groups. Surprisingly the answer\nis yes and was the dissertation of Ada Rottl\u00e4nder[@Rot], a student of\nSchur\u2019s, in 1927. Her example uses groups already discovered by Otto\nH\u00f6lder in his famous classification of the groups of order $p^3$,\n$p^2 q$, and $p^4$. With the modern understanding of groups the\ncounterexample is rather simple to describe \u2013 though a proof remains a\nlittle tedious.\n\nLet $V=\\mathbb{Z}_q^2$ where $q$ is a prime \u2013 that is $V$ is the\n2-dimensional vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_q$. Let $p|q-1$ be\nanother prime. As $p|q-1$, $\\mathbb{Z}_p\\leq \\mathbb{Z}_q^\\times$ so if\nwe write $\\mathbb{Z}_p=\\langle \\omega\\rangle$ multiplicatively so that\nwe have for every $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}_q$, $n\\mapsto \\omega\\cdot n$ is an\nautomorphism of $\\mathbb{Z}_q$. (Note that $\\omega$ is often called a\nprimitive $p$-th root of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_q$ as it spans the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_p$ subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_q^\\times$.) Furthermore, for any\n$0\\leq i\\leq p-1$ we get an automorphism\n$f_i:\\mathbb{Z}_q\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_q$ given by\n$$f_i(n)=\\omega^i n.$$ Therefore to every $0\\leq i\\leq p-1$ we can\ndefine a group $G_i=\\langle V,g_i\\rangle$, $g_i=f_1\\oplus f_i$ as a\nsubgroup of $AGL(V)$. That is to say, $G_i=V\\rtimes \\langle g_i\\rangle$\nwhere the action of $g_i$ on $V$ is given by: for every $v\\in V$,\n$v=\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ m\\end{bmatrix}$ for $n,m\\in \\mathbb{Z}_q$ set\n$$g_i(v)=\\begin{bmatrix} \\omega & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\omega^i\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} n\\\\ m\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}\\omega n\\\\ \\omega^i m\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nWe are now prepared to give the Rottl\u00e4nder counterexample.\n\nNow let $a$ and $b$ be integers between $2$ and $p-1$ such that $a$ is\nnot congruent to $b$ modulo $p$. Notice this already forces $p>3$ so our\nsmallest example is $q=11$ and $p=5$. Then $G_a$ is not isomorphic to\n$G_b$ (compare the eigenvalues of $g_a$ to $g_b$ \u2013 they are not equal so\nthe linear transformations are not conjugate in $GL(2,q)$.) However,\n$G_a$ and $G_b$ have isomorphic subgroup lattices including matching\nconjugacy classes.\n\n[10]{}\n\nRottl\u00e4nder, Ada, *Nachweis der Existenz nicht-isomorpher Gruppen von\ngleicher Situation der Untergruppen*, Math.
