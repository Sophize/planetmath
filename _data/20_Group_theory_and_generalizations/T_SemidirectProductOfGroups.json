  "definition": "The goal of this exposition is to carefully explain the correspondence\nbetween the notions of external and internal semi\u2013direct products of\ngroups, as well as the connection between semi\u2013direct products and short\nexact sequences.\n\nNaturally, we start with the construction of semi\u2013direct products.\n\nLet $H$ and $Q$ be groups and let\n$\\theta: Q {\\longrightarrow}{\\operatorname{Aut}}(H)$ be a group\nhomomorphism. The [*semi\u2013direct product*]{} $H {\\rtimes}_\\theta Q$ is\ndefined to be the group with underlying set $\\{(h,q) {\\mid}h \\in\nH,\\ q \\in Q\\}$ and group operation $(h,q)(h',q') := (h \\theta(q) h',\nqq')$.\n\nWe leave it to the reader to check that $H {\\rtimes}_\\theta Q$ is really\na group. It helps to know that the inverse of $(h,q)$ is\n$(\\theta(q^{-1}) (h^{-1}), q^{-1})$.\n\nFor the remainder of this article, we omit $\\theta$ from the notation\nwhenever this map is clear from the context.\n\nSet $G := H {\\rtimes}Q$. There exist canonical monomorphisms $H\n{\\longrightarrow}G$ and $Q {\\longrightarrow}G$, given by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nh \\mapsto (h,1_Q),& \\ & h \\in H \\\\\nq \\mapsto (1_H,q),& \\ & q \\in Q\\end{aligned}$$ where $1_H$ (resp. $1_Q$)\nis the identity element of $H$ (resp. $Q$). These monomorphisms are so\nnatural that we will treat $H$ and $Q$ as subgroups of $G$ under these\ninclusions.\n\n\\[ext-to-int\\] Let $G := H {\\rtimes}Q$ as above. Then:\n\n-   $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n-   $HQ = G$.\n\n-   $H {\\cap}Q = \\{1_G\\}$.\n\nLet $p: G {\\longrightarrow}Q$ be the projection map defined by\n$p(h,q) = q$. Then $p$ is a homomorphism with kernel $H$. Therefore $H$\nis a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nEvery $(h,q) \\in G$ can be written as $(h,1_Q) (1_H,q)$. Therefore $HQ\n= G$.\n\nFinally, it is evident that $(1_H,1_Q)$ is the only element of $G$ that\nis of the form $(h,1_Q)$ for $h \\in H$ and $(1_H,q)$ for $q \\in\nQ$.\n\nThis result motivates the definition of internal semi\u2013direct products.\n\nLet $G$ be a group with subgroups $H$ and $Q$. We say $G$ is the\n[*internal semi\u2013direct product*]{} of $H$ and $Q$ if:\n\n-   $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n-   $HQ = G$.\n\n-   $H {\\cap}Q = \\{1_G\\}$.\n\nWe know an external semi\u2013direct product is an internal semi\u2013direct\nproduct (Theorem\u00a0\\[ext-to-int\\]). Now we prove a converse\n(Theorem\u00a0\\[int-to-ext\\]), namely, that an internal semi\u2013direct product\nis an external semi\u2013direct product.\n\n\\[unique\\] Let $G$ be a group with subgroups $H$ and $Q$. Suppose $G=HQ$\nand $H\n{\\cap}Q = \\{1_G\\}$. Then every element $g$ of $G$ can be written\nuniquely in the form $hq$, for $h \\in H$ and $q \\in Q$.\n\nSince $G=HQ$, we know that $g$ can be written as $hq$. Suppose it can\nalso be written as $h'q'$. Then $hq=h'q'$ so ${h'}^{-1}h = q' q^{-1} \\in\nH {\\cap}Q = \\{1_G\\}$. Therefore $h=h'$ and $q=q'$.\n\n\\[int-to-ext\\] Suppose $G$ is a group with subgroups $H$ and $Q$, and\n$G$ is the internal semi\u2013direct product of $H$ and $Q$. Then $G {\\cong}H\n{\\rtimes}_\\theta Q$ where\n$\\theta: Q {\\longrightarrow}{\\operatorname{Aut}}(H)$ is given by\n$$\\theta(q)(h) := qhq^{-1},\\ q \\in Q,\\, h \\in H.$$\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0\\[unique\\], every element $g$ of $G$ can be written uniquely in\nthe form $hq$, with $h \\in H$ and $q \\in Q$. Therefore, the map\n$\\phi: H {\\rtimes}Q {\\longrightarrow}G$ given by $\\phi(h,q) = hq$ is a\nbijection from $G$ to $H {\\rtimes}Q$. It only remains to show that this\nbijection is a homomorphism.\n\nGiven elements $(h,q)$ and $(h',q')$ in $H {\\rtimes}Q$, we have\n$$\\phi((h,q)(h',q')) = \\phi((h \\theta(q)(h'),qq')) =\n\\phi(hqh'q^{-1},qq') = hqh'q' = \\phi(h,q) \\phi(h',q').$$ Therefore\n$\\phi$ is an isomorphism.\n\nConsider the external semi\u2013direct product $G := H {\\rtimes}_\\theta\nQ$ with subgroups $H$ and $Q$. We know from Theorem\u00a0\\[int-to-ext\\] that\n$G$ is isomorphic to the external semi\u2013direct product $H\n{\\rtimes}_{\\theta'} Q$, where we are temporarily writing $\\theta'$ for\nthe conjugation map $\\theta'(q)(h) := qhq^{-1}$ of\nTheorem\u00a0\\[int-to-ext\\]. But in fact the two maps $\\theta$ and $\\theta'$\nare the same:\n$$\\theta'(q)(h) = (1_H,q) (h,1_Q) (1_H, q^{-1}) = (\\theta(q)(h),1_Q) =\n\\theta(q)(h).$$ In summary, one may use Theorems\u00a0\\[ext-to-int\\]\nand\u00a0\\[int-to-ext\\] to pass freely between the notions of internal\nsemi\u2013direct product and external semi\u2013direct product.\n\nFinally, we discuss the correspondence between semi\u2013direct products and\nsplit exact sequences of groups.\n\nAn exact sequence of groups\n$$1 {\\longrightarrow}H \\stackrel{i}{{\\longrightarrow}} G \\stackrel{j}{{\\longrightarrow}} Q {\\longrightarrow}1.$$\nis [*split*]{} if there exists a homomorphism $k: Q {\\longrightarrow}G$\nsuch that $j {\\circ}k$ is the identity map on $Q$.\n\nLet $G$, $H$, and $Q$ be groups. Then $G$ is isomorphic to a semi\u2013direct\nproduct $H {\\rtimes}Q$ if and only if there exists a split exact\nsequence\n$$1 {\\longrightarrow}H \\stackrel{i}{{\\longrightarrow}} G \\stackrel{j}{{\\longrightarrow}} Q {\\longrightarrow}1.$$\n\nFirst suppose $G {\\cong}H {\\rtimes}Q$. Let $i: H {\\longrightarrow}G$ be\nthe inclusion map $i(h) = (h,1_Q)$ and let $j: G {\\longrightarrow}Q$ be\nthe projection map $j(h,q) = q$. Let the splitting map\n$k: Q {\\longrightarrow}G$ be the inclusion map $k(q) = (1_H,q)$. Then\nthe sequence above is clearly split exact.\n\nNow suppose we have the split exact sequence above. Let\n$k: Q {\\longrightarrow}G$ be the splitting map. Then:\n\n-   $i(H) = \\ker j$, so $i(H)$ is normal in $G$.\n\n-   For any $g \\in G$, set $q := k(j(g))$. Then $j(gq^{-1}) = j(g)\n    j(k(j(g)))^{-1} = 1_Q$, so $gq^{-1} \\in {\\operatorname{Im}}i$. Set\n    $h :=\n    gq^{-1}$. Then $g=hq$. Therefore $G=i(H)k(Q)$.\n\n-   Suppose $g \\in G$ is in both $i(H)$ and $k(Q)$. Write $g =\n    k(q)$. Then $k(q) \\in {\\operatorname{Im}}i = \\ker j$, so\n    $q = j(k(q)) =\n    1_Q$. Therefore $g = k(q) = k(1_Q) = 1_G$, so $i(H) {\\cap}k(Q) =\n    \\{1_G\\}$.\n\nThis proves that $G$ is the internal semi\u2013direct product of $i(H)$ and\n$k(Q)$. These are isomorphic to $H$ and $Q$, respectively. Therefore $G$\nis isomorphic to a semi\u2013direct product $H\n{\\rtimes}Q$.\n\nThus, not all normal subgroups $H \\subset G$ give rise to an (internal)\nsemi\u2013direct product $G = H {\\rtimes}G/H$. More specifically, if $H$ is a\nnormal subgroup of $G$, we have the canonical exact sequence\n$$1 {\\longrightarrow}H {\\longrightarrow}G {\\longrightarrow}G/H {\\longrightarrow}1.$$\nWe see that $G$ can be decomposed into $H {\\rtimes}G/H$ as an internal\nsemi\u2013direct product if and only if the canonical exact sequence splits.",
