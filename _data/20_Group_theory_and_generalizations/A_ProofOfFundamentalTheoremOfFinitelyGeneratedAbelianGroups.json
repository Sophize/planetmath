  "argumentText": "Every finitely generated abelian group $A$ is a direct sum of its cyclic\nsubgroups, i.e.\n$$A=C_{m_1}\\oplus C_{m_2}\\oplus\\ldots\\oplus C_{m_k}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\ldots\\oplus\\mathbb{Z},$$\nwhere $1<m_1 \\mid m_2 \\mid \\ldots \\mid m_k$. The numbers $m_i$ are\nuniquely determined as well as the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$\u2019s, which is\nthe rank of an abelian group.\n\nProof. Let $G$ be an abelian group with $n$ generators. Then for a free\ngroup $F_n$, $G$ is isomorphic to the quotient group $F_n/A$. Now $F_n$\nand $A$ contain a basis $f_1,\\ldots,f_n$ and $a_1,\\ldots,a_k$ satisfying\n$a_i=m_if_i$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq k$. As $G\\cong F_n/A$, it suffices to\nshow that $F_n/A$ is a direct sum of its cyclic subgroups\n$\\langle f_1+A\\rangle$.\n\nIt is clear that $F_n/A$ is generated by its subgroups\n$\\langle f_i+A\\rangle$. Assume that the zero element of $F_n/A$ can be\nwritten as a form $A=l_1f_1+\\ldots+l_nf_n+A$. It follows that\n$l_1f_1+\\ldots+l_nf_n=a\\in A$. As we write $a$ as a linear combination\nof that basis and using $a_i=m_if_i$ we get the equations\n$$l_1f_1+\\ldots+l_nf_n=s_1a_1+\\ldots s_ka_k=s_1m_1f_1+\\ldots +s_km_kf_k.$$\nAs every element can be represented uniquely as a linear combination of\nits free generators $f_1$, we have $l_i=s_im_i$ for every\n$1\\leq i\\leq k$ and $l_j=0$ for every $k<j\\leq n$.\n\nThis means that every element $l_if_i$ belongs to $A$, so $l_if_i+A=A$.\nTherefore the zero element has a unique representation as a sum of the\nelements of the subgroup $\\langle f_i+\\!A\\rangle$.\n\n[9]{} .
