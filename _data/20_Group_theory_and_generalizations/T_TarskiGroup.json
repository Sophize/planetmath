  "definition": "A *Tarski group* is an infinite group $G$ such that every non-trivial\nproper subgroup of $G$ is of prime order.\n\nTarski groups are also called *Tarski monsters*, especially in the case\nwhen all the proper non-trivial subgroups are of the same order (that\nis, when the Tarski group is a for some prime $p$).\n\nAlexander Ol\u2019shanskii[@ol1; @ol2] showed that Tarski groups exist, and\nthat there is a Tarski $p$-group for every prime $p > 10^{75}$.\n\nFrom the definition one can easily deduce a number of properties of\nTarski groups. For example, every Tarski group is a simple group, it\nsatisfies the minimal condition and the maximal condition, it can be\ngenerated by just two elements, it is periodic but not locally finite,\nand its is .\n\n[9]{} A.\u00a0Yu.\u00a0Olshanskii, [*An infinite group with subgroups of prime\norders*]{}, Math.\u00a0USSR Izv.\u00a016 (1981), 279\u2013289; translation of Izvestia\nAkad.\u00a0Nauk SSSR Ser.\u00a0Matem.\u00a044 (1980), 309\u2013321.
