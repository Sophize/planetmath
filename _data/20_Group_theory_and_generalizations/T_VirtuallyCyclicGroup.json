  "definition": "A *virtually cyclic group* is a group that has a cyclic subgroup of\nfinite . Every virtually cyclic group in fact has a normal cyclic\nsubgroup of finite index (namely, the core of any cyclic subgroup of\nfinite index), and virtually cyclic groups are therefore also known as\n*cyclic-by-finite groups*.\n\nA finite-by-cyclic group (that is, a group $G$ with a finite normal\nsubgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is cyclic) is always virtually cyclic. To\nsee this, note that a finite-by-cyclic group is either finite, in which\ncase it is certainly virtually cyclic, or it is finite-by-$\\Z$, in which\ncase the .\n\nFinite-by- groups are also virtually cyclic. In fact, we have the\nfollowing classification theorem:[@hempel][@rdiat]\n\nGroups of the following three types are all virtually cyclic. Moreover,\nevery virtually cyclic group is of exactly one of these three types.\n\n-   finite\n\n-   finite-by-(infinite cyclic)\n\n-   finite-by-(infinite dihedral)\n\nAs an immediate corollary we have the following result:[@macpherson]\n\nEvery torsion-free virtually cyclic group is either trivial or infinite\ncyclic.\n\n[9]{} Lemma 11.4 (pages 102\u2013103) in: John Hempel, [*3-Manifolds*]{},\nAmerican Mathematical Society, 2004, ISBN 0821836951.
