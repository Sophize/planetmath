  "definition": "#### Overview and definition.\n\nLet $G$ be a group acting transitively on a set $X$. In other words, we\nconsider a homomorphism $\\phi:G\\to{\\operatorname{Perm}}(X),$ where the\nlatter denotes the group of all bijections of $X$. If we consider $G$ as\nbeing, in some sense, the automorphisms of $X$, the transitivity\nassumption means that it is impossible to distinguish a particular\nelement of $X$ from any another element. Since the elements of $X$ are\nindistinguishable, we call $X$ a *homogeneous space*. Indeed, the\nconcept of a homogeneous space, is logically equivalent to the concept\nof a transitive group action.\n\n#### Action on cosets.\n\nLet $G$ be a group, $H<G$ a subgroup, and let $G/H$ denote the set of\nleft cosets, as above. For every $g\\in G$ we consider the mapping\n$\\psi_H(g):G/H \\to G/H$ with action $$a H \\to ga H,\\quad a\\in G.$$\n\nThe mapping $\\psi_H(g)$ is a bijection. The corresponding mapping\n$\\psi_H:G\\to{\\operatorname{Perm}}(G/H)$ is a group homomorphism,\nspecifying a transitive group action of $G$ on $G/H$.\n\nThus, $G/H$ has the natural structure of a homogeneous space. Indeed, we\nshall see that every homogeneous space $X$ is isomorphic to $G/H$, for\nsome subgroup $H$.\n\nN.B. In geometric applications, the want the homogeneous space $X$ to\nhave some extra structure, like a topology or a differential structure.\nCorrespondingly, the group of automorphisms is either a continuous group\nor a Lie group. In order for the quotient space $X$ to have a Hausdorff\ntopology, we need to assume that the subgroup $H$ is closed in $G$.\n\n#### The isotropy subgroup and the basepoint identification.\n\nLet $X$ be a homogeneous space. For $x\\in X$, the subgroup\n$$H_x = \\{ h\\in G: hx = x \\},$$ consisting of all $G$-actions that fix\n$x$, is called the isotropy subgroup at the basepoint $x$. We identify\nthe space of cosets $G/H_x$ with the homogeneous space by means of the\nmapping $\\tau_{x}: G/H_x \\to X$, defined by\n$$\\tau_{x}(aH_x) = ax,\\quad a\\in G.$$\n\nThe above mapping is a well-defined bijection.\n\nTo show that $\\tau_x$ is well defined, let $a,b\\in G$ be members of the\nsame left coset, i.e. there exists an $h\\in H_x$ such that $b=ah$.\nConsequently $$bx = a(hx) = ax,$$ as desired. The mapping $\\tau_{x}$ is\nonto because the action of $G$ on $X$ is assumed to be transitive. To\nshow that $\\tau_x$ is one-to-one, consider two cosets\n$aH_x, bH_x,\\; a,b\\in G$ such that $ax=bx$. It follows that $b^{-1}a$\nfixes $x$, and hence is an element of $H_x$. Therefore $aH_x$ and $bH_x$\nare the same coset.\n\n#### The homogeneous space as a quotient.\n\nNext, let us show that $\\tau_{x}$ is equivariant relative to the action\nof $G$ on $X$ and the action of $G$ on the quotient $G/H_x$.\n\nWe have that $$\\phi(g)\\circ\\tau_x = \\tau_x\\circ\\psi_{H_x}(g)$$ for all\n$g\\in G$.\n\nTo prove this, let $g,a\\in G$ be given, and note that\n$$\\psi_{H_x}(g)(aH_x)=gaH_x.$$ The latter coset corresponds under\n$\\tau_{x}$ to the point $gax$, as desired.\n\nFinally, let us note that $\\tau_x$ identifies the point $x\\in X$ with\nthe coset of the identity element $eH_x$, that is to say, with the\nsubgroup $H_x$ itself. For this reason, the point $x$ is often called\nthe basepoint of the identification $\\tau_x: G/H_x \\to X$.\n\n#### The choice of basepoint.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of the choice of basepoint on the quotient\nstructure of a homogeneous space. Let $X$ be a homogeneous space.\n\nThe set of all isotropy subgroups $\\{ H_x : x\\in X\\}$ forms a single\nconjugacy class of subgroups in $G$.\n\nTo show this, let $x_0,\nx_1\\in X$ be given. By the transitivity of the action we may choose a\n${\\hat{g}}\\in G$ such that $x_1 = {\\hat{g}}x_0$. Hence, for all $h\\in G$\nsatisfying $hx_0 = x_0$, we have\n$$({\\hat{g}}h {\\hat{g}}^{-1}) x_1 = {\\hat{g}}(h ( {\\hat{g}}^{-1} x_1)) = {\\hat{g}}x_0 = x_1.$$\nSimilarly, for all $h\\in H_{x_1}$ we have that\n${\\hat{g}}^{-1} h {\\hat{g}}$ fixes $x_0$. Therefore,\n$${\\hat{g}}(H_{x_0}) {\\hat{g}}^{-1} = H_{x_1};$$ or what is equivalent,\nfor all $x\\in X$ and $g\\in G$ we have $$g H_x g^{-1} = H_{gx}.$$\n\n#### Equivariance.\n\nSince we can identify a homogeneous space $X$ with $G/H_x$ for every\npossible $x\\in X$, it stands to reason that there exist equivariant\nbijections between the different $G/H_x$. To describe these, let\n$H_0, H_1<G$ be conjugate subgroups with\n$$H_1 = {\\hat{g}}H_0 {\\hat{g}}^{-1}$$ for some fixed ${\\hat{g}}\\in G$.\nLet us set $$X=G/H_0,$$ and let $x_0$ denote the identity coset $H_0$,\nand $x_1$ the coset ${\\hat{g}}H_0$. What is the subgroup of $G$ that\nfixes $x_1$? In other words, what are all the $h\\in G$ such that\n$$h  {\\hat{g}}H_0 = {\\hat{g}}H_0,$$ or what is equivalent, all $h\\in G$\nsuch that $${\\hat{g}}^{-1} h {\\hat{g}}\\in H_0.$$ The collection of all\nsuch $h$ is precisely the subgroup $H_1$. Hence,\n$\\tau_{x_1}: G/H_1\\to G/H_0$ is the desired equivariant bijection. This\nis a well defined mapping from the set of $H_1$-cosets to the set of\n$H_0$-cosets, with action given by\n$$\\tau_{x_1}(a H_1)=a {\\hat{g}}H_0,\\quad a\\in G.$$\n\nLet $\\psi_0:\nG\\to {\\operatorname{Perm}}(G/H_0)$ and\n$\\psi_1:G\\to {\\operatorname{Perm}}(G/H_1)$ denote the corresponding\ncoset $G$-actions.\n\nFor all $g\\in G$ we have that\n$$\\tau_{x_1}\\circ\\psi_1(g)  =  \\psi_0(g)\\circ \\tau_{x_1}.$$",
