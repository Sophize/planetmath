  "statement": "Let $G$ be a group.\n\nFirst suppose that $G$ is residually finite, that is,\n$$\\mathrm{R}(G) := \\bigcap_{N {\\trianglelefteqslant_{\\mathrm{f}}}G} N = 1$$\n(where $N {\\trianglelefteqslant_{\\mathrm{f}}}G$ denotes that $N$ is a\nnormal subgroup of finite index in $G$). Consider the natural mapping of\n$G$ into its profinite completion $\\hat{G}$ given by\n$g \\mapsto (Ng)_{N {\\trianglelefteqslant_{\\mathrm{f}}}G}$. It is clear\nthat the kernel of this map is precisely $\\mathrm{R}(G)$, so that it is\na monomorphism when $G$ is residually finite.\n\nNow suppose that $G$ embeds into its profinite completion $\\hat{G}$ and\nidentify $G$ with a subgroup of $\\hat{G}$. Now, a theorem on profinite\ngroups tells us that\n$$\\bigcap_{N {\\trianglelefteqslant_{\\mathrm{o}}}\\hat{G}} N = 1,$$ (where\n$N {\\trianglelefteqslant_{\\mathrm{o}}}G$ denotes that $N$ is an normal\nsubgroup of $G$) and since open subgroups of a profinite group have\nfinite index, we have that $$\\mathrm{R}(\\hat{G}) = 1,$$ so $\\hat{G}$ is\nresidually finite. Then $G$ is a subgroup of a residually finite group,\nso is itself residually finite, as required.\n\n[99]{}\n\nJ.\u00a0D.
