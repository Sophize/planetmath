  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group and $k$ a field. Consider the class\n$$\\mathcal{R}=\\{X\\ |\\ X\\mbox{ is a representation of }G\\mbox{ over }k\\}$$\nand its subclass $\\mathcal{R}_f$ consisting of those representations\nwhich are finite-dimensional as vector spaces. We consider a special\nrepresentation $$\\mathcal{F}=(V,\\cdot)$$ where $V$ is a fixed vector\nspace with a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ which is in bijective correspondence\nwith $G$. If $f:\\mathcal{B}\\to G$ is a required bijection, then we\ndefine ,,$\\cdot$\u201d on basis $\\mathcal{B}$ by $$g\\cdot b = gf(b)$$ where\non the right side we have a multiplication in $G$. It can be shown that\nthis gives us a well-defined representation and further more, if\n$X\\in\\mathcal{R}_f$, then there exists an epimorphism of representations\n$$e:\\mathcal{F}^n\\to X$$ for some $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ ($\\mathcal{F}$ is a\n,,free\u201d representation). In particular every finite-dimensional\nrepresentation is a quotient of a direct sum of copies of $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThis fact shows that a maximal subclass\n$\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathcal{R}_f$ consisting of pairwise nonisomorphic\nrepresentations is actually a set (note that $\\mathcal{X}$ is never\nunique). Fix such a set.\n\n**Definition.** **The representation semiring** $\\overline{R_k(G)}$ of\n$G$ is defined as a triple $(\\mathcal{X}, +, \\cdot)$, where\n$\\mathcal{X}$ is a maximal set of pairwise nonisomorphic representations\ntaken from $\\mathcal{R}_f$. Addition and multiplication are given by\n$$X+Y=Z$$ where $Z$ is a representation in $\\mathcal{X}$ isomorphic to\nthe direct sum $X\\oplus Y$ and $$X\\cdot Y=Z'$$ where $Z'$ is a\nrepresentation in $\\mathcal{X}$ isomorphic to the tensor product\n$X\\otimes Y$. Note that $\\overline{R_k(G)}$ is not a ring, because there\nare no additive inverses.\n\n**The representation ring** $R_k(G)$ is defined as induced from\n$\\overline{R_k(G)}$. It can be shown that the definition does not depend\non the choice of $\\mathcal{X}$ (in the sense that it always gives us\nnaturally isomorphic rings).\n\nIt is convenient to forget about formal definition which includes the\nchoice of $\\mathcal{X}$ and simply write elements of $\\overline{R_k(G)}$\nas isomorphism classes of representations $[X]$. Thus every element in\n$R_k(G)$ can be written as a formal difference $[X]-[Y]$. And we can\nwrite $$[X]+[Y]=[X\\oplus Y];$$ $$[X][Y] =[X\\otimes Y].$$",
