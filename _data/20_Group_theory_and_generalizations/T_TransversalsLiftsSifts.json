  "definition": "Given a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, a *transversal* of $H$ in\n$G$ is a subset $T\\subseteq G$ such that for every $g\\in G$ there exists\na unique $t\\in T$ such that $Hg=Ht$.\n\nTypically one insists $1\\in T$ so that the coset $H$ is described\nuniquely by $H1$. However no standard terminology has emerged for\ntransversals of this sort.\n\nAn alternative definition for a transversal is to use functions and\nhomomorphisms in a method more conducive to a categorical setting. Here\none replaces the notion of a transversal as a subset of $G$ and instead\ntreats it as a certain type of map $T:G/H\\rightarrow G$. Since $H$ is\ngenerally not normal in $G$, $G/H$ simply means the set of cosets, and\n$T$ is therefore a function not a homomorphism. We only require that $T$\nsatisfy the following property: Given the canonical projection map\n$\\pi:G\\rightarrow G/H$ given by $g\\mapsto Hg$ (this is generally not a\nhomomorphism either, and so both $\\pi$ and $T$ are simply functions\nbetween sets) then $\\pi T=1_{G/H}$. It follows immediately that the\nimage of $T$ in $G$ is a transversal in the original sense of the term.\n\nBecause it is customary in group theory to write actions to the right of\nelements many times it is preferable to write $T\\pi=1_{G/H}$ to match\nthe right side notation.\n\nWhen $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ our terminology adjusts from\ntransversals to *lifts*.\n\nGiven a group $G$ and a homomorphism $\\pi:G\\rightarrow Q$, a *lift* of\n$Q$ to $G$ is a function $f:Q\\rightarrow G$ such that $\\pi f=1_Q$.\n\nIt follows that $\\pi$ must be an epimorphism if it has a lift. Once\nagain it is nearly always requested that $f(1)=1$ but this restriction\nis generally not part of the definition.\n\nBecause both lifts and transversals are injective mappings it is common\nto use the word lift/transversal for the image and the map with the\ncontext of the use providing any necessary clarification.\n\nGiven a group $G$ and a homomorphism $\\pi:G\\rightarrow Q$, a *splitting\nmap* of $Q$ to $G$ is a *homomorphism* $f:Q\\rightarrow G$ such that\n$\\pi f=1_Q$.\n\nSo we see a gradual progression in the definitions: We always have a\ngroup $G$ and a set $Q$, and the maps $\\pi:G\\rightarrow Q$,\n$f:Q\\rightarrow G$ satisfying $$\\pi f=1_{Q}.$$ It follows, $f$ is\ninjective and $\\pi$ is surjective.\n\n-   $f$ is a transversal if $Q=G/H$ for some subgroup $H$. Here $\\pi$\n    and $f$ are simply functions.\n\n-   $f$ is a lift if $Q$ is a group. Here $\\pi$ is a homomorphism and\n    $f$ a function.\n\n-   $f$ is a splitting map if $Q$ is group and both $\\pi$ and $f$ are\n    homomorphisms.\n\nFinally we arrive at a stronger requirement for transversals and lifts\nwhich makes greater use of the group structure involved.\n\nGiven a group $G=\\langle S\\rangle$, there is a natural map\n$\\pi:F(S)\\rightarrow G$ from the free group on $S$ onto $G$. A *lift* is\na map $l:G\\rightarrow F(S)$ such that $\\pi l =1_G$. Furthermore a *sift*\nis a lift $s:G\\rightarrow F(S)$ with the added condition that $sg=g$ for\nall $g\\in S$.\n\nAlthough a general sift is no more than a map that writes the elements\nof $G$ as reduced words in $S$, in many cases the sifts have the added\nproperty of providing the words in a canonical form. This occurs when\n$G=T_0\\cdots T_{n-1}$ where $T_i$ is a transversal of $G^i/G^{i+1}$. In\nsuch a case every element in $G$ has a unique decomposition as a word\n$t_0t_1\\cdots t_{n-1}$ for unique $t_i\\in T_i$.",
