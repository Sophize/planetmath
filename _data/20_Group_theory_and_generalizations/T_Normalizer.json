The [*normalizer*]{} of $H$\nin $G$, written $N_G(H)$, is the set $$\\{ g \\in G \\mid gHg^{-1}=H \\}.$$\n\nA subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be [*self-normalizing*]{} if\n$N_G(H) = H$.\n\nProperties {#properties .unnumbered}\n==========\n\n$N_G(H)$ is always a subgroup of $G$, as it is the stabilizer of $H$\nunder the action $(g,H)\\mapsto gHg^{-1}$ of $G$ on the set of all\nsubsets of $G$ (or on the set of all subgroups of $G$, if $H$ is a\nsubgroup).\n\nIf $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $H\\leq N_G(H)$.\n\nIf $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $H$ is a normal subgroup of $N_G(H)$;\nin fact, $N_G(H)$ is the largest subgroup of $G$ of which $H$ is a\nnormal subgroup. In particular, if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $H$ is\nnormal in $G$ if and only if $N_G(H)=G$.",
