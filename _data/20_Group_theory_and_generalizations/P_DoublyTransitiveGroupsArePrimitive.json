To show the action is , we\nmust show that all blocks are trivial blocks; to do this, it suffices to\nshow that any block containing more than one element is all of $X$. So\nchoose a block $Y$ with two distinct elements $y_1, y_2$. Given an\narbitrary $x\\in X$, since $G$ is doubly transitive, we can choose\n$\\sigma\\in G$ such that $$\\sigma\\cdot(y_1,y_2)=(y_1,x)$$ But then\n$\\sigma\\cdot Y\\cap Y\\neq\\emptyset$, since $y_1$ is in both. Thus\n$\\sigma\\cdot Y=Y$, so $x\\in Y$ as well. So $Y=X$ and we are done.",
