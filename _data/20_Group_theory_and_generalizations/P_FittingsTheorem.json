  "statement": "*Fitting\u2019s Theorem* states that if $G$ is a group and $M$ and $N$ are\nnormal nilpotent of $G$, then $MN$ is also a normal nilpotent subgroup\n(of nilpotency class less than or equal to the sum of the nilpotency\nclasses of $M$ and $N$).\n\nThus, any finite group has a unique largest normal nilpotent subgroup,\ncalled its *Fitting subgroup*. More generally, the Fitting subgroup of a\ngroup $G$ is defined to be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the normal\nnilpotent subgroups of $G$; Fitting\u2019s Theorem shows that the Fitting\nsubgroup is always locally nilpotent. A group that is equal to its own\nFitting subgroup is sometimes called a *Fitting group*.",
