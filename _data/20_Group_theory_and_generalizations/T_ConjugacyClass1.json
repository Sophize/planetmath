  "definition": "Let $G$ a group, and consider its operation (action) on itself give by\nconjugation, that is, the mapping $$(g,x)\\mapsto gxg^{-1}$$\n\nSince conjugation is an equivalence relation, we obtain a partition of\n$G$ into equivalence classes, called *conjugacy classes*. So, the\nconjugacy class of $X$ (represented $C_x$ or $C(x)$ is given by\n$$C_x=\\{y\\in X :y=gxg^{-1} \\mbox{for some }g\\in G\\}$$",
