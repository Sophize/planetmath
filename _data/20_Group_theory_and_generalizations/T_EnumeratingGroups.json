  "definition": "How many finite groups are there?\n=================================\n\nThe current tables list the number of groups up to order 2000 \\[Besche,\nEick, O\u2019Brien\\] (2000).\n\nThe graph is chaotic \u2013 both figuratively and mathematically. Most groups\nare distributed along the interval at values $2^i m$ where $m$ is odd\nand $i$ large, for instance $i>5$. Indeed most groups are actually of\norder $2^{10}=1024$. We see this by connecting the dots of certain\nfamilies of groups.\n\nMost integers are square-free, most groups are not \\[Mays 1980; Miller\n1930; Balas 1966\\].\n\nAn explanation for this distribution is offered by considering nilpotent\ngroups. Nilpotent groups are the product of their Sylow subgroups. So\nenumerating nilpotent groups asks to enumerating $p$-groups.\n\nHow many nilpotent groups are there?\n====================================\n\nIf $g_{nil}(N)$ is the number of nilpotent groups of order $\\leq N$ and\n$g(N)$ the number of groups of order $\\leq N$ then\n$$\\lim_{N\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\log g_{nil}(N)}{\\log g(N)}=1.$$\n\nThe proof bounds the number of groups with a given set of Sylow\nsubgroups and involves the Classification of Finite Simple Groups.\n\n$$\\lim_{N\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{g_{nil}(N)}{g(N)}=1.$$\n\nIf the conjecture is true, then most groups are 2-groups.\n\nThe Higman and Sims bounds\n==========================\n\nThe number of $p$-groups of order $p^n$, denoted, $f(p^n)$, satisfies\n$$\\frac{2}{27}n^3 + C_1 n^2 \\leq \\log_p f(p^n)\\leq \\frac{2}{27}n^3 + C_2 n^{8/3}$$\nfor constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\nThis result should be compared to the later work of Neretin on\nenumerating algebras. The lower bound is the work of Higman and is\nachieved by constructing a large family of class 2 $p$-groups (called\n$\\Phi$-class 2 groups as $\\Phi(\\Phi(P))=1$ where $\\Phi$ is the Frattini\nsubgroup of $P$).\n\nThe $n^{8/3}$ factor has been improved to $o(n^{5/2})$ by M. Newman and\nSeeley. Sims\u2019 suggests that it should be possible to show\n$$\\log_p f(p,n)\\in \\frac{2}{27}n^3 + O(n^2)$$ (with a positive leading\ncoefficient) which would prove Pyber\u2019s conjecture \\[Shalev\\].\n\nS. R. Blackburn\u2019s work (1992) on the number of class 3 p-groups provides\nstrong evidence that this claim is true as he demonstrates that class 3\ngroups also attain this lower bound. Since class 3 groups involve the\nJacobi identity (Hall-Witt identity) it is plausible to expect class c,\nfor c less than some fixed bound, will asymptotically achieve the lower\nbound as well.",
