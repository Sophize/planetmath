  "definition": "Let $G$ be a topological group. A *unitary representation* of $G$ is a\npair $(\\pi, H)$ where $H$ is a Hilbert space and $\\pi: G \\to U(H)$ is a\nhomomorphism such that the mapping of $G \\times H \\to H$ that sends\n$(g,v)$ to $\\pi(g)v$ is continuous. Here $U(H)$ denotes the set of\nunitary operators of $H$. The group $G$ is said to act unitarily on $H$\nor sometimes, $G$ is said to act by unitary representation on $H$.",
