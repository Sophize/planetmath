  "definition": "Let $M(X)$ be a free monoid with involution $^{-1}$ on $X$. A word\n$w\\in M(X)$ is said to be *cyclically reduced* if every cyclic conjugate\nof it is reduced. In other words, $w$ is cyclically reduced iff $w$ is a\nreduced word and that if $w=uvu^{-1}$ for some words $u$ and $v$, then\n$w=v$.\n\nFor example, if $X=\\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace$, then words such as\n$$c^{-1}bc^2a\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad abac^2ba^2$$ are cyclically reduced,\nwhere as words $$a^2bca^{-1}\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad cb^2b^3c$$ are not,\nthe former is reduced, but of the form $a(abc)a^{-1}$, while the later\nis not even a reduced word.\n\n**Remarks**. The concept of cyclically reduced words carries over to\nwords in groups. We consider words in a group $G$.\n\n-   If a word is cyclically reduced, so is its inverse and all of its\n    cyclic conjugates.\n\n-   A word $v$ is a *cyclic reduction* of a word $w$ if $w=uvu^{-1}$ for\n    some word $u$, and $v$ is cyclically reduced. Clearly, every word\n    and its cyclic reduction are conjugates of each other. Furthermore,\n    any word has a unique cyclic reduction.\n\n-   Every group $G$ has a presentation $\\langle S| R\\rangle$ such that\n\n    1.  $R$ is cyclically reduced (meaning every element of $R$ is\n        cyclically reduced),\n\n    2.  closed under inverses (meaning if $u\\in R$, then $u^{-1}\\in R$),\n        and\n\n    3.  closed under cyclic conjugation (meaning any cyclic conjugate of\n        an element in $R$ is in $R$).\n\n    Furthermore, if $G$ is finitely presented, $R$ above can be chosen\n    to be finite.\n\n    Every group $G$ has a presentation $\\langle S| R'\\rangle$. There is\n    an isomorphism from $F(S)/N(R')$ to $G$, where $F(S)$ is the free\n    group freely generated by $S$, and $N(R')$ is the normalizer of the\n    subset $R'\\subseteq F(S)$ in $F(S)$. Let $R''$ be the set of all\n    cyclic reductions of words in $R'$. Then $N(R'')=N(R')$, since any\n    word not cyclically reduced in $R'$ is conjugate to its cyclic\n    reduction in $R''$, and hence in $N(R'')$. Next, for each\n    $u\\in R''$, toss in its inverse and all of its cyclic conjugates.\n    The resulting set $R$ is still cyclically reduced. Furthermore, $R$\n    satisfies the remaining conditions above. Finally, $N(R)=N(R'')$, as\n    any cyclic conjugate $v$ of a word $w$ is clearly a conjugate of\n    $w$. Therefore, $G$ has presentation $\\langle S| R\\rangle$.\n\n    If $G$ is finitely presented, then $S$ and $R'$ above can be chosen\n    to be finite sets. Therefore, $R''$ and $R$ are both finite. $R$ is\n    finite because the number of cyclic conjugates of a word is at most\n    the length of the word, and hence finite.",
