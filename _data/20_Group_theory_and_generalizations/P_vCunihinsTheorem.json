For $\\pi=\\{p\\}$, this essentially reduces to the Sylow theorems\n    (with unnecessary hypotheses).\n\n2.  If $G$ is solvable, it is $\\pi$-separable for all $\\pi$, so such\n    subgroups exist for all $\\pi$. This result is often called Hall\u2019s\n    theorem. There is another Hall\u2019s theorem, which is similar to this\n    one, can be be found .\n\n[9]{} Derek J.S. Robinson. *A Course in the Theory of Groups*, second\nedition. Springer (1995)",
