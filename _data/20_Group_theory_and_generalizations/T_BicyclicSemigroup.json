  "definition": "The *bicyclic semigroup* ${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$ is the monoid\ngenerated by $\\{p, q\\}$ with the single relation $pq = 1$.\n\nThe elements of ${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$ are all words of the form\n$q^n p^m$ for $m, n \\geq 0$ (with the understanding $p^0 = q^0 = 1$).\nThese words are multiplied as follows: $$q^n p^m q^k p^l = \\begin{cases}\n    q^{n+k-m} p^l \\qquad & \\text{if }m \\leq k, \\\\\n    q^n p^{l+m-k}        & \\text{if }m \\geq k.\n  \\end{cases}$$\n\nIt is apparent that ${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$ is simple, for if $q^n p^m$\nis an element of ${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$, then $1 = p^n (q^n p^m) q^m$\nand so $S^1q^n p^mS^1 = S$.\n\nIt is also easy to see that ${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$ is an inverse\nsemigroup: the element $q^np^m$ has inverse $q^mp^n$.\n\nIt is useful to picture some further properties of\n${\\mathcal{C}({p},{q})}$ by arranging the elements in a table:\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n    1   & p    & p^2    & p^3    & p^4    & \\dots \\\\\n    q   & qp   & qp^2   & qp^3   & qp^4   & \\dots \\\\\n    q^2 & q^2p & q^2p^2 & q^2p^3 & q^2p^4 & \\dots \\\\\n    q^3 & q^3p & q^3p^2 & q^3p^3 & q^3p^4 & \\dots \\\\\n    q^4 & q^4p & q^4p^2 & q^4p^3 & q^4p^4 & \\dots \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots\n  \\end{matrix}$$\n\nThen the elements below any horizontal line drawn through this table\nform a right ideal and the elements to the right of any vertical line\nform a left ideal. Further, the elements on the diagonal are all\nidempotents and their standard ordering is\n$$1 > qp > q^2 p^2 > q^3 p^3 > \\dotsb.$$",
