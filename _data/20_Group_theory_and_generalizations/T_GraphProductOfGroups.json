  "definition": "Let $\\Gamma$ be a finite undirected graph and let\n$\\{G_v \\colon v\\in V(\\Gamma)\\}$ be a collection of groups associated\nwith the vertices of $\\Gamma$. Then the *graph product of the groups*\n$G_v$ is the group $G=F/R$, where $F$ is the free product of the $G_v$\nand $R$ is generated by the relations that elements of $G_u$ commute\nwith elements of $G_v$ whenever $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $\\Gamma$.\n\nThe free product and the direct product are the extreme examples of the\ngraph product. To obtain the free product, let $\\Gamma$ be an\nanticlique, and to obtain the direct product, let $\\Gamma$ be a clique.\n\n[9]{} E.R.
