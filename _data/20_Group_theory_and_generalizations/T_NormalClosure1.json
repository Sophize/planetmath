  "definition": "Let $S$ be a subset of a group $G$. The *normal closure* of $S$ in $G$\nis the intersection of all normal subgroups of $G$ that contain $S$,\nthat is $$\\bigcap_{S\\subseteq N\\normal G}\\!\\!N.$$ The normal closure of\n$S$ is the smallest normal subgroup of $G$ that contains $S$, and so is\nalso called the *normal subgroup generated by* $S$.\n\nIt is not difficult to show that the normal closure of $S$ is the\nsubgroup generated by all the conjugates of elements of $S$.\n\nThe normal closure of $S$ in $G$ is variously denoted by\n$\\langle S^G\\rangle$ or $\\langle S\\rangle^G$ or $S^G$.\n\nIf $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, and $H$ is of finite index in its normal\nclosure, then $H$ is said to be *nearly normal*.",
