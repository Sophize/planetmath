  "definition": "Let $M$ be a nonempty subset of a ring $A$. The intersection of all\nsubrings of $A$ that include $M$ is the smallest subring of $A$ that\nincludes $M$. It is called the *[subring generated by]{} $M$ and is\ndenoted by $\\genby{M}$.*\n\nThe subring generated by $M$ is formed by finite sums of monomials of\nthe form\n:$$a_1a_2 \\cdots a_n, \\mbox{where} \\;\\;\\displaystyle a_1,\\ldots , a_n \\in M.$$\nOf particular interest is the subring generated by a family of subrings\n$E = \\{A_i|\\;\\; i\\in I\\}$. It is the ring $R$ formed by finite sums of\nmonomials of the\nform:$$\\displaystyle a_{i_1}a_{i_2} \\ldots a_{i_n}, \\mbox{where}\\;\\; a_{i_k} \\in A_{i_k}.$$\nIf $A,B$ are rings, the subring generated by $A \\cup B$ is also denoted\nby $AB$. In the case when $A_i$ are fields included in a larger field\n$A$ then the set of all quotients of elements of $R$ ( the quotient\nfield of $R$) is the composite field $\\bigvee_{i\\in I}A_i$ of the family\n$E$. In other words, it is the subfield generated by\n$\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$. The notation $\\bigvee_{i\\in I}A_i$ comes from the\nfact that the family of all subfields of a field forms a complete\nlattice. The of fields is defined only when the respective fields are\nall included in a larger field.",
