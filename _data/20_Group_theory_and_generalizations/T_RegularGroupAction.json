  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group action on a set $X$. The action is called if for any\npair $\\alpha, \\beta \\in X$ there exists exactly one $g \\in G$ such that\n$g \\cdot \\alpha = \\beta$. (For a right group action it is defined\ncorrespondingly.)\n\nA key example of a regular action is the regular representation of a\ngroup, with action given by group multiplication.",
