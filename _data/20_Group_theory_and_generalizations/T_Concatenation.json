Loosely speaking, the *concatenation*, or\n*juxtaposition* of $a$ and $b$ is the word of the form $ab$. In order to\ndefine this rigorously, let us first do a little review of what words\nare.\n\nLet $\\Sigma$ be a set whose elements we call *letters* (we also call\n$\\Sigma$ an *alphabet*). A (finite) word or a string on $\\Sigma$ is a\npartial function $w:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\Sigma$, (where $\\mathbb{N}$ is the\nset of natural numbers), such that, if\n$\\operatorname{dom}(w)\\ne \\varnothing$, then there is an\n$n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $$w \\textrm{ is } \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\textrm{defined for every }m\\le n,\\\\\n\\textrm{undefined otherwise.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ This $n$ is necessarily unique, and is called the *length* of\nthe word $w$. The length of a word $w$ is usually denoted by $|w|$. The\nword whose domain is $\\varnothing$, the empty set, is called the empty\nword, and is denoted by $\\lambda$. It is easy to see that $|\\lambda|=0$.\nAny element in the range of $w$ has the form $w(i)$, but it is more\ncommonly written $w_i$. If a word $w$ is not the empty word, then we may\nwrite it as $w_1w_2\\cdots w_n$, where $n=|w|$. The collection of all\nwords on $\\Sigma$ is denoted $\\Sigma^*$ (the asterisk $^*$ is commonly\nknown as the Kleene star operation of a set). Using the definition\nabove, we see that $\\lambda\\in \\Sigma^*$.\n\nNow we define a binary operation $\\circ$ on $\\Sigma^*$, called the\n*concatenation* on the alphabet $\\Sigma$, as follows: let\n$v,w\\in \\Sigma^*$ with $m=|v|$ and $n=|w|$. Then $\\circ(v,w)$ is the\npartial function whose domain is the set\n$\\lbrace 1, \\ldots, m, m+1, \\ldots, m+n\\rbrace$, such that\n$$\\circ(v,w)(i) = \\left\\{ \n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv(i) & \\textrm{if }i\\le m\\\\\nw(i-m) & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{array} \n\\right.$$ The partial function $\\circ(v,w)$ is written $v\\circ w$, or\nsimply $vw$, when it does not cause any confusion. Therefore, if\n$v=v_1\\cdots v_m$ and $w=w_1\\cdots w_n$, then\n$vw=v_1\\cdots v_mw_1\\cdots w_n$.\n\nBelow are some simple properties of $\\circ$ on words:\n\n-   $\\circ$ is associative: $(uv)w=u(vw)$.\n\n-   $\\lambda w=w\\lambda = w$.\n\n-   As a result, $\\Sigma^*$ together with $\\circ$ is a monoid.\n\n-   $vw=\\lambda$ iff $v=w=\\lambda$.\n\n-   As a result, $\\Sigma^*$ is never a group unless\n    $\\Sigma^*=\\lbrace \\lambda\\rbrace$.\n\n-   If $a=bc$ where $a$ is a letter, then one of $b,c$ is $a$, and the\n    other the empty word $\\lambda$.\n\n-   If $ab=cd$ where $a,b,c,d$ are letters, then $a=c$ and $b=d$.\n\n### Concatenation on Languages {#concatenation-on-languages .unnumbered}\n\nThe concatenation operation $\\circ$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$ can be\nextended to operations on languages over $\\Sigma$. Suppose $A,B$ are two\nlanguages over $\\Sigma$, we define\n$$A\\circ B:= \\lbrace u\\circ v \\mid u\\in A, v\\in B\\rbrace.$$ When there\nis no confusion, we write $AB$ for $A\\circ B$.\n\nBelow are some simple properties of $\\circ$ on languages:\n\n-   $(AB)C=A(BC)$; , concatenation of sets of letters is associative.\n\n-   Because of the associativity of $\\circ$, we can inductively define\n    $A^n$ for any positive integer $n$, as $A^1=A$, and $A^{n+1}=A^nA$.\n\n-   It is not hard to see that\n    $\\Sigma^*=\\lbrace \\lambda \\rbrace \\cup \\Sigma \\cup \\Sigma^2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\Sigma^n \\cup \\cdots$.\n\n**Remark**. A formal language containing the empty word, and is closed\nunder concatenation is said to be *monoidal*, since it has the structure\nof a monoid.\n\n[9]{} H.R. Lewis, C.H.
