  "definition": "For every semisimple group $G$ there is a normal subgroup $H$ of $G$,\n(called the centerless competely reducible radical) which isomorphic to\na direct product of nonabelian simple groups such that conjugation on\n$H$ gives an injection into ${\\mathrm{Aut}\\,}(H)$. Thus $G$ is\nisomorphic to a subgroup of ${\\mathrm{Aut}\\,}(H)$ containing the inner\nautomorphisms, and for every group $H$ isomorphic to a direct product of\nnon-abelian simple groups, every such subgroup is semisimple.",
