  "definition": "The *star height* of a regular expression $p$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$,\ndenoted by ${\\operatorname{ht}}(p)$, is defined recursively as follows:\n\n1.  ${\\operatorname{ht}}(\\varnothing)={\\operatorname{ht}}(a)=0$ for any\n    $a\\in \\Sigma$;\n\n2.  ${\\operatorname{ht}}(p\\cup q)={\\operatorname{ht}}(pq)=\\max({\\operatorname{ht}}(p),{\\operatorname{ht}}(q))$;\n\n3.  ${\\operatorname{ht}}(p^*)={\\operatorname{ht}}(p)+1$.\n\nLet $\\Sigma=\\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace$. The following expressions have star\nheight $0,1,2,3$:\n$$(a\\cup b)c  \\qquad a^*b^* \\qquad (a^*b)^*c \\qquad ((ab^*a \\cup c)^* b)^*$$\n\nSince any regular expression $p$ describes a regular language $L(p)$, we\nmay extend the definition of star height to regular languages. However,\nsince a regular language may be described by more than one regular\nexpressions, we need to be a little careful:\n\nThe *star height* of a regular language $L$ is the least integer $i$\nsuch that $L$ may be described by a regular expression of star height\n$i$. In other words:\n$${\\operatorname{ht}}(L)=\\min \\lbrace h(p) \\mid L=L(p)\\mbox{, }p\\in R(\\Sigma) \\rbrace,$$\nwhere $R(\\Sigma)$ is the set of all regular expressions over $\\Sigma$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Any regular language over a singleton alphabet has star height at\n    most 1, which can be proved by the pumping lemma for regular\n    languages.\n\n-   If the alphabet $\\Sigma$ consists of at least two letters, then for\n    every positive integer $n$, there is a regular language whose star\n    height is $n$. In fact, it can be shown that if $|\\Sigma|=2$, then\n    for every $n$, there is a regular language $L$ over $\\Sigma$ such\n    that ${\\operatorname{ht}}(L)=n$.\n\n-   It was an open question whether an algorithm exists for determining\n    ${\\operatorname{ht}}(L)$ for an arbitrary regular language $L$. In\n    2005, the question was resolved by D. Kirsten in the positive, and\n    the algorithm is that of a non-deterministic finite automaton.\n\n-   We may also define star height on generalized regular expressions.\n    For a regular language $L$, define\n    ${\\operatorname{ht}}_g(L)=\\min \\lbrace h(p) \\mid L=L(p)\\mbox{, }p\\in R_g(\\Sigma) \\rbrace$,\n    where $R_g(\\Sigma)$ is the set of all generalized regular\n    expressions. It is clear that\n    ${\\operatorname{ht}}_g(L)\\le {\\operatorname{ht}}(L)$. However, it is\n    still an open question whether, for every integer $n$, there is a\n    regular language $L$ with ${\\operatorname{ht}}_g(L)=n$.\n\n    A star-free language has star height $0$ with respect to\n    representations by generalized regular expressions, but may be\n    positive with respect to representations by regular expressions, for\n    example $L=\\lbrace ab\\rbrace^*$.\n\n[9]{} A.
