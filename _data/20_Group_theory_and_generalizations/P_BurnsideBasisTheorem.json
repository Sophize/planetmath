  "statement": "If $G$ is a finite $p$-group, then ${\\mathrm{Frat}\\,}G=G' G^p$, where\n${\\mathrm{Frat}\\,}G$ is the Frattini subgroup, $G'$ the commutator\nsubgroup, and $G^p$ is the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers.\n\nThe theorem implies that $G/{\\mathrm{Frat}\\,}G$ is elementary abelian,\nand thus has a minimal generating set of exactly $n$ elements, where\n$|G:{\\mathrm{Frat}\\,}G|=p^n$. Since any lift of such a generating set\nalso generates $G$ (by the non-generating property of the Frattini\nsubgroup), the smallest generating set of $G$ also has $n$ elements.\n\nThe theorem also holds for profinite $p$-groups (inverse limit of finite\n$p$-groups).",
