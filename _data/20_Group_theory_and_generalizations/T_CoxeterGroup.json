  "definition": "A *Coxeter group* $G$ is a finitely generated group, which carries a\npresentation of the form\n$$W=\\langle w_1,\\dots,w_n\\mid (w_iw_j)^{m_{ij}}=1\\rangle$$ where the\nintegers $m_{ij}$ satisfy $m_{ii}=1$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$ and\n$m_{ij}=m_{ji}\\ge 2$ for $i\\ne j$. The exponents form a matrix\n$[m_{ij}]_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}$ often called the *Coxeter matrix*. This is\na cousin of the *Cartan matrix* and both encode the information of the\nDynkin diagrams.\n\nA Dynkin diagram is the graph with the adjacency matrix given by\n$[m_{ij}-2]_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}$ where $[m_{ij}]_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}$ is a\nCoxeter matrix.\n\nA finite Coxeter group is *irreducible* if it is not the direct product\nof smaller coxeter groups. These groups are classified and labeled\nlabeled by the Bourbaki types\n$$\\mathsf{A}_n, \\mathsf{B}_n, \\mathsf{C}_n, \n\\mathsf{D}_n, \\mathsf{E}_6, \\mathsf{E}_7, \\mathsf{E}_8, \\mathsf{F}_4, \n\\mathsf{G}_2, \\mathsf{H}_2^n, \\mathsf{I}_3,\\mathsf{I}_4.$$ The\nclassification depends on realizing the groups as reflections of\nhyperplanes in a finite dimensional real vector space. Then observing a\ncondition on an inner product to be integer valued, it is possible to\nshow these families of symmetry are all that can exist. The Cartan\nmatrix encodes these integer values of the inner product of adjacent\nreflections while the Coxeter matrix encodes the orders of adjacent\nproducts of generators.\n\nThe notation $\\mathsf{A}_n$ should not be confused with the natation for\nthe alternating group on $n$ elements, $A_n$. This unfortunate overlap\nis also a problem with $\\mathsf{D}_n$ which is not the same as the\ndihedral group on $n$-vertices, $D_n$.\n\nAlternative methods to study Coxeter groups is through the use of a\nlength measurement on elements in the group. As every element in $g$ in\na Coxeter group is the product of the involutions $w_1,\\dots,w_n$, the\n*length* is defined as the shortest word in these $w_i's$ to equal $g$.\nWe denote this $\\l(g)$. Then using careful analysis and the *exchange\ncondition* it is also possible to specify many of the necessary\nproperties of irreducible Coxeter groups.\n\nRecall that a Weyl group $W$ is a group generated by involutions $S$,\nthat is, generated by elements of order 2. The *exchange condition* on a\n$W$ with respect to $S$ states that given a reduced word\n$w=w_{i_1}\\cdots w_{i_k}$ in $W$, $w_i\\in S$, such that for every\n$s\\in S$, $\\l(sw)\\leq \\l(w)$ then there exists an $j$ such that\n$$sw=w_{i_1}\\cdots w_{i_{j-1}}w_{i_{j+1}}\\cdots w_{i_k}.$$\n\nThe insistence that $w_i^2=1$ shows that Coxeter groups are generated by\ninvolutions. This makes every Coxeter group a Weyl group. However, not\nevery Weyl group is a Coxeter group.\n\nThe remaining condition to make a Weyl group a Coxeter group is the\nexchange condition. Thus every finite Weyl group with the exchange\ncondition is a Coxeter group, and visa-versa.\n\nCoxeter groups arrise as the Weyl groups of Lie algebra, Lie groups, and\ngroups of with a BN-pair. However many other usese exist. It should be\nnoted that the study of Lie theory makes use only of the\n*crystallographic* coxeter groups, which are those of type\n$$\\mathsf{A}_n, \\mathsf{B}_n, \\mathsf{C}_n, \n\\mathsf{D}_n, \\mathsf{E}_6, \\mathsf{E}_7, \\mathsf{E}_8, \\mathsf{F}_4, \n\\mathsf{G}_2.$$ Thus it omits $\\mathsf{H}_2^n$, $\\mathsf{I}_3$ and\n$\\mathsf{I}_4$\n\nCoxeter groups as reflections\n=============================\n\nLet us see more concretely how a finite Coxeter group can be realized.\n\nLet $V$ be a real Euclidean vector space and $\\mathcal O(V)$ the group\nof all orthogonal transformations of $V$.\n\nA *reflection* of $V$ is a linear transformation $S$ that carries each\nvector to its mirror image with respect to a fixed hyperplane\n$\\mathcal P$; it is clear geometrically that a reflection is an\northogonal transformation.\n\nA subgroup $\\mathcal G\\le\\mathcal O(V)$ will be called *effective* if\n$V_0(\\mathcal G)=0$ where\n$V_0(\\mathcal G)=\\bigcap_{T\\in\\mathcal G}\\{x\\in V\\mid Tx=x\\}$.\n\nA finite Coxeter group can be realized as (i.e. is always isomorphic to)\na finite effective subgroup $\\mathcal G$ of $\\mathcal O(V)$ that is\ngenerated by a set of reflections, for some Euclidean space $V$.\n\nClassification of irreducible finite Coxeter groups\n===================================================\n\nType $\\mathsf{A}_n$: This group is isomorphic to the symmetric group on\n$n$ elements, $S_n$. The coxeter matrix is encoded by\n$m_{i,i+1}=3=m_{i+1,i}$ and all other terms are 2. To observe the\nisomorphism let $$w_1=(1,2),(2,3),\\dots,w_n=(n-1,n).$$ Then $w_i^2=1$,\nfor instance $(1,2)^2=()$, $(w_i w_j)^2=1$ if $|i-j|>1$, for example\n$((1,2)(3,4))^2=0$ and $(w_i w_{i+1})^3=1$ as we see with\n$(1,2)(2,3)=(1,2,3)$ which has order 3.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram is: $$\\xymatrix{\n\\circ\\ar@{-}[r] & \\circ\\ar@{-}[r] & \\circ\\ar@{--}[r] & \\circ .\n}$$\n\nType $\\mathsf{B}_n$, $\\mathsf{C}_n$: This group is isomorphic to the\nwreath product $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\wr S_n$, that is, the semi-direct product\nof $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n \\rtimes S_n$ where $S_n$ permutes the entries of the\nvectors in $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$.\n\nThe designation of type $\\mathsf{B}_n$ and $\\mathsf{C}_n$ relate to the\nfact that two different methods can be given to construct the same group\n(as the Weyl group of $O(2n+1,k)$ or as the Weyl group of $Sp(2n,k)$).\nIt is also common to see $\\mathsf{C}_n$ used as the sole label.\n\nType $\\mathsf{H}_2^n$: These groups are the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ for\n$n\\geq 5$ and $n\\neq 6$.\n\nType $\\mathsf{G}_2$: This group is isomorphic to $S_3$.\n\nL.
