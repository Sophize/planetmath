  "definition": "The *socle* of a group is the subgroup generated by all minimal normal\nsubgroups. Because the product of normal subgroups is a subgroup, it\nfollows we can remove the word \u201cgenerated\u201d and replace it by \u201cproduct.\u201d\nSo the socle of a group is now the product of its minimal normal\nsubgroups. This description can be further refined with a few\nobservations.\n\nIf $M$ and $N$ are minimal normal subgroups then $M$ and $N$ centralize\neach other.\n\nGiven two distinct minimal normal subgroup $M$ and $N$, $[M,N]$ is\ncontained in $N$ and $M$ as both are normal. Thus $[M,N]\\leq M\\cap N$.\nBut $M$ and $N$ are distinct minimal normal subgroups and $M\\cap N$ is\nnormal so $M\\cap N=1$ thus $[M,N]=1$.\n\nThe socle of a finite group is a direct product of minimal normal\nsubgroups.\n\nLet $S$ be the socle of $G$. We already know $S$ is the product of its\nminimal normal subgroups, so let us assume $S=N_1\\cdots N_k$ where each\n$N_i$ is a distinct minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Thus\n$N_1{\\cap}N_2=1$ and $N_1 N_2$ clearly contains $N_1$ and $N_2$. Now\nsuppose we extend this to a subsquence\n$N_{i_1}=N_1, N_{i_2}=N_2,N_{i_3},\\dots,N_{i_j}$ where\n$$N_{i_{k}}{\\cap}(N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_{k-1}})=1$$ for $1\\leq k<j$ and\n$N_i\\leq N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_j}$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq i_j$. Then consider\n$N_{i_j +1}$.\n\nAs $N_{i_j +1}$ is a minimal normal subgroup and $N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_j}$\nis a normal subgroup, $N_{i_j +1}$ is either contained in\n$N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_j}$ or intersects trivially. If $N_{i_j +1}$ is\ncontained in $N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_j}$ then skip to the next $N_i$,\notherwise set it to be $N_{i_{j+1}}$. The result is a squence\n$N_{i_1},\\dots,N_{i_j}$ of minimal normal subgroups where\n$S=N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_s}$ and\n$$N_{i_j}{\\cap}(N_{i_1}\\cdots N_{i_{j-1}})=1,\\quad 1\\leq j\\leq s.$$ As\nwe have already seen distinct minimal normal subgroups centralize each\nother we conclude that $S=N_{i_1}\\times\\cdots \\times N_{i_s}$.\n\nA minimal normal subgroup is characteristically simple, so if it is\nfinite then it is a product of isomorphic simple groups.\n\nIf $M$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$ and $1<C<M$ is characteristic\nin $M$, then $C$ is normal in $G$ which contradicts the minimality of\n$M$. Thus $M$ is characteristically simple.\n\nThe socle of a finite group is a direct product of simple groups.\n\nAs each $N_{i_j}$ is characteristically simple each $N_{i_j}$ is a\ndirect product of isomorphic simple groups, thus $S$ is a direct product\nsimple groups.",
