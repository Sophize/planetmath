More generally, all Gruenberg groups\nare locally nilpotent.\n\nProperties {#properties .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nAny subgroup or of a locally nilpotent group is locally nilpotent.\nRestricted direct products of locally nilpotent groups are locally\nnilpotent.\n\nFor each prime $p$, the elements of $p$-power order in a locally\nnilpotent group form a fully invariant subgroup (the maximal ). The\nelements of finite order in a locally nilpotent group also form a fully\ninvariant subgroup (the torsion subgroup), which is the restricted\ndirect product of the maximal $p$-subgroups. (This generalizes the fact\nthat a finite nilpotent group is the direct product of its Sylow\nsubgroups.)\n\nEvery group $G$ has a unique maximal locally nilpotent normal subgroup.\nThis subgroup is called the *Hirsch-Plotkin radical*, or *locally\nnilpotent radical*, and is often denoted $\\operatorname{HP}(G)$. If $G$\nis finite (or, more generally, satisfies the maximal condition), then\nthe Hirsch-Plotkin radical is the same as the Fitting subgroup, and is\nnilpotent.",
