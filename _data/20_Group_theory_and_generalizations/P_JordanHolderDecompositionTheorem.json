  "statement": "Every finite group $G$ has a filtration\n$$G \\supset G_0 \\supset \\cdots \\supset G_n = \\{1\\},$$ where each\n$G_{i+1}$ is normal in $G_i$ and each quotient group $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is a\nsimple group. Any two such decompositions of $G$ have the same multiset\nof simple groups $G_i/G_{i+1}$ up to ordering.\n\nA filtration of $G$ satisfying the properties above is called a\n[*Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder decomposition*]{} of $G$.",
