  "definition": "Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$.\n\nThe *core* (or *normal interior*, or *normal core*) of $H$ in $G$ is the\nintersection of all conjugates of $H$ in $G$:\n\n$$\\core{G}{H} = \\bigcap_{x\\in G}x^{-1}Hx.$$\n\nIt is not hard to show that $\\core{G}{H}$ is the largest normal subgroup\nof $G$ contained in $H$, that is, $\\core{G}{H}\\normal G$ and if\n$N\\normal G$ and $N\\subseteq H$ then $N\\subseteq\\core{G}{H}$. For this\nreason, some authors denote the core by $H_G$ rather than $\\core{G}{H}$,\nby analogy with the notation $H^G$ for the normal closure.\n\nIf $\\core{G}{H}=\\{1\\}$, then $H$ is said to be *core-free*.\n\nIf $\\core{G}{H}$ is of finite index in $H$, then $H$ is said to be\n*normal-by-finite*.\n\nLet $\\cal L$ be the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. By considering the\naction of $G$ on $\\cal L$ it can be shown that the $G/\\core{G}{H}$\nembeds in the symmetric group $\\operatorname{Sym}({\\cal L})$. A\nconsequence of this is that if $H$ is of finite index in $G$, then\n$\\core{G}{H}$ is also of finite index in $G$, and $[G:\\core{G}{H}]$\ndivides $[G:H]!$ (the factorial of $[G:H]$). In particular, if a simple\ngroup $S$ has a proper subgroup of finite index $n$, then $S$ must be of\nfinite order dividing $n!$, as the core of the subgroup is trivial. It\nalso follows that a group is virtually abelian if and only if it is\nabelian-by-finite, because the core of an abelian subgroup of finite\nindex is a normal abelian subgroup of finite index (and the same\nargument applies if \u2018abelian\u2019 is replaced by any other property that is\ninherited by subgroups).",
