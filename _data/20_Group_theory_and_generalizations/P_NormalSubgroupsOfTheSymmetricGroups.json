  "statement": "For $n\\geq 5$, $A_n$ is the only proper nontrivial normal subgroup of\n$S_n$.\n\nThis is essentially a corollary of the simplicity of the alternating\ngroups $A_n$ for $n\\geq 5$. Let $N\\unlhd S_n$ be normal. Clearly\n$N\\cap A_n\\unlhd A_n$. But $A_n$ is simple, so $N\\cap A_n=A_n$ or\n$N\\cap A_n=\\{e\\}$. In the first case, either $N=A_n$, or else $N$ also\ncontains an permutation, in which case $N=S_n$. In the second case,\neither $N=\\{e\\}$ or else $N$ consists solely of one or more odd\npermutations in addition to $\\{e\\}$. But if $N$ contains two distinct\nodd permutations, $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, then either $\\sigma^2\\neq e$ or\n$\\sigma\\tau\\neq e$, and both $\\sigma^2$ and $\\sigma\\tau$ are ,\ncontradicting the assumption that $N$ contains only odd nontrivial\npermutations. Thus $N$ must be of order $2$, consisting of a single odd\npermutation of order 2 together with the identity.\n\nIt is easy to see, however, that such a subgroup cannot be normal. An\nodd permutation of order $2$, $\\sigma$, has as its cycle decomposition\none or more (an odd number, in fact, though this does not matter here)\nof disjoint transpositions. Suppose wlog that $(1~2)$ is one of these\ntranspositions. Then $\\tau=(1~3)\\sigma(1~3)=(1~3)(1~2)(\\ldots)(1~3)$\ntakes $2$ to $3$ and thus is neither $\\sigma$ nor $e$. So this group is\nnot normal.\n\nIf $n=1$, $S_1$ is the trivial group, so it has no nontrivial \\[normal\\]\nsubgroups.\n\nIf $n=2$, $S_2=C_2$, the unique group on $2$ elements, so it has no\nnontrivial \\[normal\\] subgroups.\n\nIf $n=3$, $S_3$ has one nontrivial proper normal subgroup, namely the\ngroup generated by $(1~2~3)$.\n\n$S_4$ is the most interesting case for $n\\leq 5$. The arguments in the\ntheorem above do not apply since $A_4$ is not simple. Recall that a\nnormal subgroup must be a union of conjugacy classes of elements, and\nthat conjugate elements in $S_n$ have the same cycle type. If we examine\nthe sizes of the various conjugacy classes of $S_4$, we get\n\n   Cycle Type   Size\n  ------------ ------\n       4         6\n      3,1        8\n      2,2        3\n     2,1,1       6\n    1,1,1,1      1\n\nA subgroup of $S_4$ must be of order $1,2,3,4,6,8$, or $12$ (the factors\nof $\\lvert S_4\\rvert=24$). Since each subgroup must contain $\\{e\\}$, it\nis easy to see that the only possible nontrivial normal subgroups have\norders $4$ and $12$. The order $4$ subgroup is\n$H=\\{e,(1~2)(3~4),(1~3)(2~4),(1~4)(2~3)\\}$, while the order $12$\nsubgroup is $A_4$. $A_4$ is obviously normal, being of index $2$, and\none can easily check that $H\\cong V_4$ is also normal in $S_4$. So these\nare the only two nontrivial proper normal subgroups of $S_4$.",
