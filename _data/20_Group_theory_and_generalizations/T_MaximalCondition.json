  "definition": "A group is said to satisfy the *maximal condition* if every strictly\nascending chain of subgroups\n$$G_1 \\subset G_2 \\subset G_3 \\subset \\cdots$$ is finite.\n\nThis is also called the *ascending chain condition*.\n\nA group satisfies the maximal condition if and only if the group and all\nits subgroups are finitely generated.\n\nSimilar properties are useful in other classes of algebraic structures:\nsee for example the Noetherian condition for rings and modules.",
