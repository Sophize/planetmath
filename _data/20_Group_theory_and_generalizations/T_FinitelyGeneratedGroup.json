  "definition": "A *finitely generated group* is a group that has a finite generating\nset.\n\nEvery finite group is obviously finitely generated. Every finitely\ngenerated group is countable.\n\nAny of a finitely generated group is finitely generated. However, a\nfinitely generated group may have subgroups that are not finitely\ngenerated. (For example, the free group of rank $2$ is generated by just\ntwo elements, but its commutator subgroup is not finitely generated.)\nNonetheless, a subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is\nnecessarily finitely generated; a bound on the number of generators\nrequired for the subgroup is given by the .\n\nThe finitely generated groups all of whose subgroups are also finitely\ngenerated are precisely the groups satisfying the maximal condition.\nThis includes all finitely generated nilpotent groups and, more\ngenerally, all polycyclic groups.\n\nA group that is not finitely generated is sometimes said to be\n*infinitely generated*.",
