  "definition": "A matrix representation of a group $G$ is a group homomorphism between\n$G$ and $GL_n({\\mathbbmss{C}})$, that is, a function\n$$X:G\\to GL_n({\\mathbbmss{C}})$$ such that\n\n-   $X(gh)=X(g)X(h)$,\n\n-   $X(e)=I$\n\nNotice that this definition is equivalent to the group representation\ndefinition when the vector space $V$ is finite dimensional over\n${\\mathbbmss{C}}$. The parameter $n$ (or in the case of a group\nrepresentation, the dimension of $V$) is called the *degree* of the\nrepresentation.\n\n[9]{} Bruce E.
