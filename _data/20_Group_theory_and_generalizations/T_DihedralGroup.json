  "definition": "The $n^{\\text{th}}$ dihedral group is the symmetry group of the regular\n$n$-sided polygon. The group consists of $n$ reflections, $n-1$\nrotations, and the identity transformation. In this entry we will denote\nthe group in question by ${\\mathcal{D}}_n$. An alternate notation is\n${\\mathcal{D}}_{2n}$; in this approach, the subscript indicates the\norder of the group.\n\nLetting $\\omega=\\exp(2\\pi i/n)$ denote a primitive $n^{\\text{th}}$ root\nof unity, and assuming the polygon is centered at the origin, the\nrotations $R_k,\\; k=0,\\ldots,n-1$ (Note: $R_0$ denotes the identity) are\ngiven by $$R_k:z \\mapsto \\omega^k z,\\quad z\\in{\\mathbb{C}},$$ and the\nreflections $M_k,\\; k=0,\\ldots,n-1$ by\n$$M_k: z\\mapsto \\omega^k \\bar{z},\\quad z\\in{\\mathbb{C}}$$ The abstract\ngroup structure is given by $$\\begin{aligned}\nR_k R_l &= R_{k+l}, &  R_k M_l &= M_{k+l}\\\\\nM_k M_l &= R_{k-l}, &  M_k R_l &= M_{k-l},\\end{aligned}$$ where the\naddition and subtraction is carried out modulo $n$.\n\nThe group can also be described in terms of generators and relations as\n$${\\left(}M_0{\\right)}^2 ={\\left(}M_1{\\right)}^2 = (M_1 M_0)^n = \\mathrm{id}.$$\nThis means that ${\\mathcal{D}}_n$ is a rank-1 Coxeter group.\n\nSince the group acts by linear transformations\n$$(x,y)\\to(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}),\\quad (x,y)\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^2$$ there is a\ncorresponding action on polynomials $p\\to\\hat{p}$, defined by\n$$\\hat{p}(\\hat{x},\\hat{y}) = p(x,y),\\quad p\\in {\\mathbb{R}}[x,y].$$ The\npolynomials left invariant by all the group transformations form an\nalgebra. This algebra is freely generated by the following two basic\ninvariants: $$x^2+y^2,\\quad x^n-\\binom{n}{2} x^{n-2}y^2 + \\cdots,$$ the\nlatter polynomial being the real part of $(x+iy)^n$. It is easy to check\nthat these two polynomials are invariant. The first polynomial describes\nthe distance of a point from the origin, and this is unaltered by\nEuclidean reflections through the origin. The second polynomial is\nunaltered by a rotation through $2\\pi/n$ radians, and is also invariant\nwith respect to complex conjugation. These two transformations generate\nthe $n{^{\\text{th}}}$ dihedral group. Showing that these two invariants\npolynomially generate the full algebra of invariants is somewhat\ntrickier, and is best done as an application of Chevalley\u2019s theorem\nregarding the invariants of a finite reflection group.",
