  "statement": "The Scott-Wiegold conjecture (1976) is stated as follows:\n\nGiven distinct prime numbers $p$, $q$ and $r$, the free product of\ncyclic groups $C_p * C_q * C_r$ is not the normal closure of any single\nelement.\n\nIn 1992 this was included as problem 5.53 of The Kourovka Notebook:\n[*Unsolved Problems in* ]{} [@Kour].\n\nThe conjecture was proven to be true in 2001 by James Howie [@Howi].\nDespite remaining an unsolved problem for 25 years, the proof is both\nbrief and fairly elementary.\n\nWhilst the question is group theoretic and involves only , the proof\ndoes not use any combinatorial but instead depends on basic notions from\ntopology.\n\nV.D.Mazurov, E.I.
