  "definition": "A group is said to be *cyclic* if it is generated by a single element.\n\nSuppose $G$ is a cyclic group generated by $x\\in G$. Then every element\nof $G$ is equal to $x^k$ for some $k\\in \\Z$. If $G$ is infinite, then\nthese $x^k$ are all distinct, and $G$ is isomorphic to the group $\\Z$.\nIf $G$ has $n$, then every element of $G$ can be expressed as $x^k$ with\n$k\\in\\{0,\\dots,n-1\\}$, and $G$ is isomorphic to the quotient group\n$\\Z/n\\Z$.\n\nNote that the isomorphisms mentioned in the previous paragraph imply\nthat all cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic to one another.\nThe infinite cyclic group is sometimes written $C_\\infty$, and the\nfinite cyclic group of order $n$ is sometimes written $C_n$. However,\nwhen the cyclic groups are written additively, they are commonly\nrepresented by $\\Z$ and $\\Z/n\\Z$.\n\nWhile a cyclic group can, by definition, be generated by a single\nelement, there are often a number of different elements that can be used\nas the generator: an infinite cyclic group has $2$ generators, and a\nfinite cyclic group of order $n$ has $\\phi(n)$ generators, where $\\phi$\nis the Euler totient function.\n\nSome basic facts about cyclic groups:\n\n-   Every cyclic group is abelian.\n\n-   Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\n-   Every quotient of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\n-   Every group of prime order is cyclic. (This follows immediately from\n    Lagrange\u2019s Theorem.)\n\n-   Every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is\n    cyclic.",
