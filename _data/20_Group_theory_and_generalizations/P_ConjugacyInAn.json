  "statement": "Recall that conjugacy classes in the symmetric group $S_n$ are\ndetermined solely by cycle type. In the alternating group $A_n$,\nhowever, this is not always true. A single conjugacy class in $S_n$ that\nis contained in $A_n$ may split into two distinct classes when\nconsidered as a subset of $A_n$. For example, in $S_3$, $(1~2~3)$ and\n$(1~3~2)$ are conjugate, since $$(2~3)(1~2~3)(2~3)=(1~3~2)$$ but these\ntwo are not conjugate in $A_3$ (note that $(2~3)\\notin A_3$).\n\nNote in particular that the fact that conjugacy in $S_n$ is determined\nby cycle type means that if $\\sigma\\in A_n$ then all of its conjugates\nin $S_n$ also lie in $A_n$.\n\nThe following theorem fully characterizes the behavior of conjugacy\nclasses in $A_n$:\n\nA conjugacy class in $S_n$ splits into two distinct conjugacy classes\nunder the action of $A_n$ if and only if its cycle type consists of\n*distinct* odd integers. Otherwise, it remains a single conjugacy class\nin $A_n$.\n\nThus, for example, in $S_7$, the elements of the conjugacy class of\n$(1~2~3~4~5)$ are all conjugate in $A_7$, while the elements of the\nconjugacy class of $(1~2~3)(4~5~6)$ split into two distinct conjugacy\nclasses in $A_7$ since there are two cycles of length $3$. Similarly,\nany conjugacy class containing an even-length cycle, such as\n$(1~2~3~4)(5~6)$, splits in $A_7$.\n\nWe will prove the above theorem by proving the following statements:\n\n-   A conjugacy class in $S_n$ consisting solely of even permutations\n    (i.e. that is contained in $A_n$) either is a single conjugacy class\n    or is the disjoint union of two equal-sized conjugacy classes when\n    considered under the action of $A_n$.\n\n-   If $\\sigma\\in A_n$, then the elements of the conjugacy class of\n    $\\sigma$ in $S_n$ (which is just all elements of the same cycle type\n    as $\\sigma$) are conjugate in $A_n$ if and only if $\\sigma$ commutes\n    with some odd permutation.\n\n-   $\\sigma\\in S_n$ does not commute with an odd permutation if and only\n    if the cycle type of $\\sigma$ consists of *distinct* odd integers.\n\nThroughout, we will denote by $\\mathcal{C}_S(\\sigma)$ the conjugacy\nclass of $\\sigma$ under the action of $S_n$.\n\nTo prove the first statement, note that conjugacy is a transitive\naction. By the theorem that orbits of a normal subgroup are equal in\nsize when the full group acts transitively, we see that if\n$\\sigma\\in A_n$, then $\\mathcal{C}_S(\\sigma)$ splits into\n$\\lvert S_n:A_n C_{S_n}(\\sigma)\\rvert$ classes under the action of $A_n$\n(recall that $C_G(x)$, the centralizer of $x$, is simply the stabilizer\nof $x$ under the conjugation action of $G$ on itself). But since\n$\\lvert S_n:A_n\\rvert$ is either $1$ or $2$, we see that the conjugacy\nclass of $\\sigma$ either remains a single class in $A_n$ or splits into\ntwo classes.\n\nNote also that the elements of $\\mathcal{C}_S(\\sigma)$ are all conjugate\nin $A_n$ if and only if $A_n C_{S_n}(\\sigma)=S_n$, which happens if and\nonly if $C_{S_n}(\\sigma)\\nsubseteq A_n$, which in turn is the case if\nand only if some odd permutation is in the centralizer of $\\sigma$,\nwhich means precisely that $\\sigma$ commutes with some odd permutation.\nThis proves the second statement.\n\nTo prove the third statement, suppose first that $\\sigma$ does not\ncommute with an odd permutation. Clearly $\\sigma$ commutes with any\ncycle in its own cycle decomposition, so if $\\sigma$ contains a cycle of\neven length, that is an odd permutation with which $\\sigma$ commutes. So\n$\\sigma$ must consist solely of \\[disjoint\\] cycles of odd length. If\ntwo of these cycles have the same length, say\n$(a_1~a_2~\\ldots~a_{2k+1})$ and $(b_1~b_2~\\ldots~b_{2k+1})$, then\n$$\\begin{gathered}\n((a_1~b_1)\\ldots(a_{2k+1}~b_{2k+1}))(a_1~a_2~\\ldots~a_{2k+1})(b_1~b_2~\\ldots~b_{2k+1})((a_1~b_1)\\ldots(a_{2k+1}~b_{2k+1}))^{-1}=\\\\\n(a_1~a_2~\\ldots~a_{2k+1})(b_1~b_2~\\ldots~b_{2k+1})\\end{gathered}$$ so\nthe product of $(a_1~a_2~\\ldots~a_{2k+1})$ and\n$(b_1~b_2~\\ldots~b_{2k+1})$, and thus $\\sigma$, commutes with the\nproduct of $2k+1$ transpositions, which is an odd permutation. Thus all\nthe cycles in the cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ must have different\n\\[odd\\] lengths.\n\nTo prove the converse, we show that if the cycles in the cycle\ndecomposition all have distinct lengths, then $\\sigma$ commutes\nprecisely with the group generated by its cycles. It follows then that\nif all the distinct lengths are odd, then $\\sigma$ commutes only with\nthese permutations, which are all even. Choose $\\sigma$ with distinct\ncycle lengths in its cycle decomposition, and suppose that $\\sigma$\ncommutes with some element $\\tau\\in S_n$. Conjugation preserves cycle\nlength, so since $\\tau$ commutes with $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma$ has all its\ncycles of distinct lengths, each cycle in $\\tau$ must commute with each\ncycle in $\\sigma$ individually.\n\nNow, choose a nontrivial cycle $\\tau_1$ of $\\tau$, and choose $j\\in\\tau$\nsuch that $\\sigma$ moves $j$ (we can do this, since $\\sigma$ can have at\nmost one cycle of length $1$ and the cycle length of $\\tau$ is greater\nthan $1$). Let $\\sigma_1$ be the cycle of $\\sigma$ containing $j$. Then\n$\\tau_1$ commutes with $\\sigma_1$ since $\\tau$ commutes with $\\sigma$,\nso $\\tau_1$ is in the centralizer of $\\sigma_1$, and it is not disjoint\nfrom $\\sigma_1$. But the centralizer of a $k$-cycle $\\rho$ consists of\nproducts of powers of $\\rho$ and cycles disjoint from $\\rho$. Thus\n$\\tau_1$ is a power of $\\sigma_1$. So each cycle in $\\tau$ is a power of\na cycle in $\\sigma$, and we are done.",
