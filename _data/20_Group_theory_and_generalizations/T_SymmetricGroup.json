  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set. Let ${\\rm Sym}(X)$ be the set of permutations of $X$\n(i.e. the set of bijective functions from $X$ to itself). Then the act\nof taking the composition of two permutations induces a group structure\non ${\\rm Sym}(X)$. We call this group the [*symmetric group*]{}.\n\nThe group ${\\rm Sym}(\\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\})$ is often denoted $S_n$ or\n$\\mathfrak{S}_n$.\n\n$S_n$ is generated by the transpositions\n$\\{(1,2),(2,3),\\ldots,(n-1,n)\\}$, and by any pair of a 2-cycle and\n$n$-cycle.\n\n$S_n$ is the Weyl group of the $A_{n-1}$ root system (and hence of the\nspecial linear group $SL_{n-1}$).",
