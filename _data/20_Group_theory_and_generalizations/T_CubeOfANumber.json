  "definition": "The [*cube of a number*]{} $x$ is the third $x^3$ of $x$. Similarly one\nmay speak of the cube of an element $x$ in any semigroup with the\noperation denoted multiplicatively (cf. general associativity).\n\nThe volume of a cube (i.e. ) with $a$ is $a^3$; hence the name.\n\nThe [*cube function*]{} $x\\mapsto x^3$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$\nis injective, but not as a mapping from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$;\none has $x^3 = y^3$ always when\n$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, the third root of unity.",
