  "definition": "Before defining quotient groups, some preliminary definitions must be\nintroduced and a few established.\n\nGiven a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, the $\\sim_L$ on $G$ defined\nby $a\\sim_L b$ if and only if $b^{-1}a\\in H$ is called *left congruence\nmodulo $H$*; similarly the relation defined by $a\\sim_R b$ if and only\nif $ab^{-1}\\in H$ is called *congruence modulo $H$* (observe that these\ntwo relations coincide if $G$ is abelian).\n\nLeft (resp. right) congruence modulo $H$ is an equivalence relation on\n$G$.\n\nWe will only give the proof for left congruence modulo $H$, as the for\nright congruence modulo $H$ is analogous. Given $a\\in G$, because $H$ is\na subgroup, $H$ contains the identity $e$ of $G$, so that\n$a^{-1}a=e\\in H$; thus $a\\sim_L a$, so $\\sim_L$ is . If $b\\in G$\nsatisfies $a\\sim_L b$, so that $b^{-1}a\\in H$, then by the of $H$ under\nthe formation of inverses, $a^{-1}b=(b^{-1}a)^{-1}\\in H$, and\n$b\\sim_L a$; thus $\\sim_L$ is symmetric. Finally, if $c\\in G$,\n$a\\sim_L b$, and $b\\sim_L c$, then we have $b^{-1}a,c^{-1}b\\in H$, and\nthe closure of $H$ under the binary operation of $G$ gives\n$c^{-1}a=(c^{-1}b)(b^{-1}a)\\in H$, so that $a\\sim_L c$, from which it\nfollows that $\\sim_L$ is , hence an equivalence relation.\n\nIt follows from the preceding that $G$ is partitioned into mutually\ndisjoint, non-empty equivalence classes by left (resp. right) congruence\nmodulo $H$, where $a,b\\in G$ are in the same equivalence class if and\nonly if $a\\sim_L b$ (resp. $a\\sim_R b$); focusing on left congruence\nmodulo $H$, if we denote by $\\bar{a}$ the equivalence class containing\n$a$ under $\\sim_L$, we see that $$\\begin{split}\n\\bar{a}&={\\{b\\in G\\mid b\\sim_L a\\}}\\\\\n&={\\{b\\in G\\mid a^{-1}b\\in H\\}}\\\\\n&={\\{b\\in G\\mid b=ah\\text{ for some }h\\in H\\}}={\\{ah\\mid h\\in H\\}}\\text{.}\n\\end{split}$$\n\nThus the equivalence class under $\\sim_L$ containing $a$ is simply the\nleft coset $aH$ of $H$ in $G$. Similarly the equivalence class under\n$\\sim_R$ containing $a$ is the right coset $Ha$ of $H$ in $G$ (when the\nbinary operation of $G$ is written additively, our notation for left and\nright cosets becomes $a+H={\\{a+h\\mid h\\in H\\}}$ and\n$H+a={\\{h+a\\mid h\\in H\\}}$). Observe that the equivalence class under\neither $\\sim_L$ or $\\sim_R$ containing $e$ is $eH=H$. The *index* of $H$\nin $G$, denoted by ${\\vertG:H\\vert}$, is the cardinality of the set\n$G/H$ (read \u201c$G$ modulo $H$\" or just \u201c$G$ mod $H$\") of left cosets of\n$H$ in $G$ (in fact, one may demonstrate the existence of a bijection\nbetween the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ and the set of right cosets\nof $H$ in $G$, so that we may well take ${\\vertG:H\\vert}$ to be the\ncardinality of the set of right cosets of $H$ in $G$).\\\nWe now attempt to impose a group on $G/H$ by taking the of the left\ncosets containing the elements $a$ and $b$, respectively, to be the left\ncoset containing the element $ab$; however, because this definition\nrequires a choice of left coset representatives, there is no guarantee\nthat it will yield a well-defined binary operation on $G/H$. For the of\nleft coset to be well-defined, we must be sure that if $a^\\prime H=aH$\nand $b^\\prime H=bH$, i.e., if $a^\\prime\\in aH$ and $b^\\prime\\in bH$,\nthen $a^\\prime b^\\prime H=abH$, i.e., that $a^\\prime b^\\prime\\in abH$.\nPrecisely what must be required of the subgroup $H$ to ensure the of the\nabove condition is the content of the following :\n\nThe rule $(aH,bH)\\mapsto abH$ gives a well-defined binary operation on\n$G/H$ if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nSuppose first that of left cosets is well-defined by the given rule,\ni.e, that given $a^\\prime\\in aH$ and $b^\\prime\\in bH$, we have\n$a^\\prime b^\\prime H=abH$, and let $g\\in G$ and $h\\in H$. Putting $a=1$,\n$a^\\prime=h$, and $b=b^\\prime=g^{-1}$, our hypothesis gives\n$hg^{-1}H=eg^{-1}H=g^{-1}H$; this implies that $hg^{-1}\\in g^{-1}H$,\nhence that $hg^{-1}=g^{-1}h^\\prime$ for some $h^\\prime\\in H$. on the\nleft by $g$ gives $ghg^{-1}=h^\\prime\\in H$, and because $g$ and $h$ were\nchosen arbitrarily, we may conclude that $gHg^{-1}\\subseteq H$ for all\n$g\\in G$, from which it follows that $H\\unlhd G$. Conversely, suppose\n$H$ is normal in $G$ and let $a^\\prime\\in aH$ and $b^\\prime\\in bH$.\nThere exist $h_1,h_2\\in H$ such that $a^\\prime=ah_1$ and\n$b^\\prime=bh_1$; now, we have\n$$a^\\prime b^\\prime=ah_1bh_2=a(bb^{-1})h_1bh_2\n=ab(b^{-1}h_1b)h_2\\text{,}$$ and because $b^{-1}h_1b\\in H$ by\nassumption, we see that $a^\\prime b^\\prime=abh$, where\n$h=(b^{-1}hb)h_2\\in H$ by the closure of $H$ under in $G$. Thus\n$a^\\prime b^\\prime\\in abH$, and because left cosets are either disjoint\nor equal, we may conclude that $a^\\prime b^\\prime H=abH$, so that\nmultiplication of left cosets is indeed a well-defined binary operation\non $G/H$.\n\nThe set $G/H$, where $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, is readily seen to\nform a group under the well-defined binary operation of left coset\nmultiplication (the of each group follows from that of $G$), and is\ncalled a *quotient* or *factor group* (more specifically the *quotient\nof $G$ by $H$*). We conclude with several examples of specific quotient\ngroups.\n\nA standard example of a quotient group is $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, the\nquotient of the of integers by the cyclic subgroup generated by\n$n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$; the order of $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is $n$, and\nthe distinct left cosets of the group are\n$n\\mathbb{Z},1+n\\mathbb{Z},\\ldots,(n-1)+n\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlthough the group $Q_8$ is not abelian, each of its subgroups its\nnormal, so any will suffice for the formation of quotient groups; the\nquotient $Q_8/{\\langle-1\\rangle}$, where ${\\langle-1\\rangle}={\\{1,-1\\}}$\nis the cyclic subgroup of $Q_8$ generated by $-1$, is of order $4$, with\nelements\n${\\langle-1\\rangle},i{\\langle-1\\rangle}={\\{i,-i\\}},k{\\langle-1\\rangle}={\\{k,-k\\}}$\n, and $j{\\langle-1\\rangle}={\\{j,-j\\}}$. Since each non-identity element\nof $Q_8/{\\langle-1\\rangle}$ is of order $2$, it is isomorphic to the\nKlein $4$-group $V$. Because each of ${\\langlei\\rangle}$,\n${\\langlej\\rangle}$, and ${\\langlek\\rangle}$ has order $4$, the quotient\nof $Q_8$ by any of these subgroups is necessarily cyclic of order $2$.\n\nThe center of the dihedral group $D_6$ of order $12$ (with\n${\\langler,s\\mid r^6=s^2=1,r^{-1}s=sr\\rangle}$) is\n${\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{1,r^3\\}}$; the elements of the quotient\n$D_6/{\\langler^3\\rangle}$ are ${\\langler^3\\rangle}$,\n$r{\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{r,r^4\\}}$,\n$r^2{\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{r^2,r^5\\}}$,\n$s{\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{s,sr^3\\}}$,\n$sr{\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{sr,sr^4\\}}$, and\n$sr^2{\\langler^3\\rangle}={\\{sr^2,sr^5\\}}$; because\n$$sr^2{\\langler^3\\rangle}r{\\langler^3\\rangle}=sr^3{\\langler^3\\rangle}=s{\\langler^3\\rangle}\\neq sr{\\langler^3\\rangle}=r{\\langler^3\\rangle}sr^2{\\langler^3\\rangle}\\text{,}$$\n$D_6/{\\langler^3\\rangle}$ is non-abelian, hence must be isomorphic to\n$S_3$.",
