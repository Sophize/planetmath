  "definition": "*Hypergroups* are generalizations of groups. Recall that a group is set\nwith a binary operation on it satisfying a number of conditions. If this\nbinary operation is taken to be multivalued, then we arrive at a\nhypergroup. In order to make this precise, we need some preliminary\nconcepts:\n\n**Definition**. A *hypergroupoid*, or *multigroupoid*, is a non-empty\nset $G$, together with a multivalued function\n$\\cdot: G\\times G\\Rightarrow G$ called the *multiplication* on $G$.\n\nWe write $a\\cdot b$, or simply $ab$, instead of $\\cdot(a,b)$.\nFurthermore, if $ab=\\lbrace c\\rbrace$, then we use the abbreviation\n$ab=c$.\n\nA hypergroupoid is said to be *commutative* if $ab=ba$ for all\n$a,b\\in G$. Defining associativity of $\\cdot$ on $G$, however, is\ntrickier:\n\nGiven a hypergroupoid $G$, the multiplication $\\cdot$ induces a binary\noperation (also written $\\cdot$) on $P(G)$, the powerset of $P$, given\nby\n$$A\\cdot B:=\\bigcup \\lbrace a\\cdot b\\mid a\\in A\\mbox{ and } b\\in B\\rbrace.$$\nAs a result, we have an induced groupoid $P(G)$. Instead of writing\n$\\lbrace a\\rbrace B$, $A\\lbrace b\\rbrace$, and\n$\\lbrace a\\rbrace \\lbrace b\\rbrace$, we write $aB, Ab$, and $ab$\ninstead. From now on, when we write $(ab)c$, we mean \u201cfirst, take the\nproduct of $a$ and $b$ via the multivalued binary operation $\\cdot$ on\n$G$, then take the product of the set $ab$ with the element $c$, under\nthe induced binary operation on $P(G)$\u201d. Given a hypergroupoid $G$,\nthere are two types of associativity we may define:\n\nType 1.\n\n:   $(ab)c\\subseteq a(bc)$, and\n\nType 2.\n\n:   $a(bc)\\subseteq (ab)c$.\n\n$G$ is said to be *associative* if it satisfies both types of\nassociativity laws. An associative hypergroupoid is called a\n*hypersemigroup*. We are now ready to formally define a hypergroup.\n\n**Definition**. A *hypergroup* is a hypersemigroup $G$ such that\n$aG=Ga=G$ for all $a\\in G$.\n\nFor example, let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Let $M$ be\nthe collection of all left cosets of $H$ in $G$. For $aH,bH\\in M$, set\n$$aH\\cdot bH := \\lbrace cH\\mid c=ahb\\mbox{, }h\\in H\\rbrace.$$ Then $M$\nis a hypergroup with multiplication $\\cdot$.\n\nIf the multiplication in a hypergroup $G$ is single-valued, then $G$ is\na , and therefore a group (see ).\n\n**Remark**. A hypergroup is also known as a *multigroup*, although some\ncall a multigroup as a hypergroup with a designated identity element\n$e$, as well as a designated inverse for every element with respect $e$.\nActually identities and inverses may be defined more generally for\nhypergroupoids:\n\nLet $G$ be a hypergroupoid. Identity elements are defined via the\nfollowing three sets:\n\n1.  (set of *left identities*):\n    $I_L(G):=\\lbrace e\\in G\\mid a\\in ea\\mbox{ for all }a\\in G\\rbrace$,\n\n2.  (set of *right identities*):\n    $I_R(G):=\\lbrace e\\in G\\mid a\\in ae\\mbox{ for all }a\\in G\\rbrace$,\n    and\n\n3.  (set of *identities*): $I(G)=I_L(G)\\cap I_R(G)$.\n\n$e \\in L(G)$ is called an *absolute identity* if $ea=ae=a$ for all\n$a\\in G$. If $e,f\\in G$ are both absolute identities, then $e = ef = f$,\nso $G$ can have at most one absolute identity.\n\nSuppose $e\\in I_L(G)\\cup I_R(G)$ and $a\\in G$. An element $b\\in G$ is\nsaid to be a *left inverse* of $a$ with respect to $e$ if $e\\in ba$.\n*Right inverses* of $a$ are defined similarly. If $b$ is both a left and\na right inverse of $a$ with respect to $e$, then $b$ is called an\n*inverse* of $a$ with respect to $e$.\n\nThus, one may say that a multigroup is a hypergroup $G$ with an identity\n$e\\in G$, and a function $^{-1}:G\\to G$ such that $a^{-1}:=^{-1}(a)$ is\nan inverse of $a$ with respect to $e$.\n\nIn the example above, $M$ is a multigroup in the sense given in the\nremark above. The designated identity is $H$ (in fact, this is the only\nidentity in $M$), and for every $aH \\in M$, its designated inverse is\nprovided by $a^{-1}H$ (of course, this may not be its only inverse, as\nany $bH$ such that $ahb=e$ for some $h\\in H$ will do).\n\n[9]{} R.
