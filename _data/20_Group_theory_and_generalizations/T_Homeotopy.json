Which is different from\n$\\pi_k(X)$, the group of homotopy classes of maps $S^k\\to X$.\n\nOne important result for any low dimensional topologist is that for a\nsurface $F$ $${\\cal{H}}_0(F)={\\rm Out}(\\pi_1(F))$$ which is the $F$\u2019s\nextended mapping class group.\n\n[**Reference**]{}\n\nG.S.
