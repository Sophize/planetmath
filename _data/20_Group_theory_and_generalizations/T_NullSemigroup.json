  "definition": "A *left zero semigroup* is a semigroup in which every element is a left\nzero element. In other words, it is a set $S$ with a product defined as\n$xy = x$ for all $x, y \\in S$.\n\nA *right zero semigroup* is defined similarly.\n\nLet $S$ be a semigroup. Then $S$ is a *null semigroup* if it has a zero\nelement and if the product of any two elements is zero. In other words,\nthere is an element $\\theta \\in S$ such that $xy = \\theta$ for all\n$x, y \\in S$.",
