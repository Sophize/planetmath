  "definition": "Suppose $A$ is a set with a binary operation. Then we say a subset $S$\nof $A$ *generates* $A$ if finite iterations of products (commonly called\nwords over $S$) from the set $S$ eventually produce every element of\n$A$. We write this property as $A=\\langle S\\rangle$.\n\nAn element $g\\in A$ is said to be a *non-generator* if given a subset\n$S$ of $A$ such that $A=\\langle S{\\cup}\\{g\\}\\rangle$ then in fact\n$A=\\langle S\\rangle$. The set of all non-generators is called the\n*Frattini subset* of $A$.\n\n\\[ex:int\\] The only non-generator of $\\mathbb{Z}$, the group of integers\nunder addition, is 0.\n\nTake $n\\neq 0$. Without loss of generality, $n$ is positive. Then take\n$1<m$ some integer relatively prime to $n$. Thus by the Euclidean\nalgorithm we know there are integers $a,b$ such that $1=am+bn$. This\nshows $1\\in \\langle m,n\\rangle$ so in fact $\\{m,n\\}$ generates\n$\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nHowever, $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not generated by $m$, as $m>1$. Therefore $n$\ncannot be removed form the generating set $\\{m,n\\}$ and so indeed the\nonly non-generator of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $0$.\n\nIn the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, the element $2$ is a non-generator.\n\nCheck the possible generating sets directly.\n\nThe set of positive integers under addition, $\\mathbb{N}$, has no\nnon-generators.\n\nApply the same proof as done to in Example \\[ex:int\\].\n\nSo we see not all sets with binary operations have non-generators. In\nthe case that a binary operation has an identity then the identity\nalways serves as a non-generator due to the convention that the empty\nword be defined as the identity. However, without further assumptions on\nthe product, such as associativity, it is not always possible to treat\nthe Frattini subset as a subobject in the category of the orignal\nobject. For example, we have just shown that the Frattini subset of a\nsemi-group need not be a semi-group.\n\nIn the category of groups, the Frattini subset is a fully invariant\nsubgroup.\n\nTo prove this, we prove the following strong re-characterize the\nFrattini subset.\n\nIn a group $G$, the intersection of all maximal subgroups is the\nFrattini subset.\n\nFor a group $G$, given a non-generator $a$, and $M$ any maximal subgroup\nof $G$. If $a$ is not in $M$ then $\\langle M,a\\rangle$ is a larger\nsubgroup than $M$. Thus $G=\\langle M,a\\rangle$. But $a$ is a\nnon-generator so $G=\\langle M\\rangle=M$. This contradicts the assumption\nthat $M$ is a maximal subgroup and therefore $a\\in M$. So the Frattini\nsubset lies in every maximal subgroup.\n\nIn contrast, if $a$ is in all maximal subgroups of $G$, then given any\nsubset $S$ of $G$ for which $G=\\langle S,a\\rangle$, then set\n$M=\\langle S\\rangle$. If $M=G$, then $a$ is a non-generator. If not,\nthen $M$ lies in some maximal subgroup $H$ of $G$. Since $a$ lies in all\nmaximal subgroup, $a$ lies in $H$, and thus $H$ contains\n$\\langle S,a\\rangle=G$. As $H$ is maximal, this is impossible. Hence\n$G=M$ and $a$ is a non-generator.",
