Then the group $\\langle S\\rangle$ generated by\n$S$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$, by assumption. Since every element $a$\nof $\\langle S\\rangle$ is a product of elements or inverses of elements\nof $S$, and $S$ is a subset of group $H$, $a\\in H$. Hence\n$\\langle S\\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of $H$, so $H$ is locally\ncyclic.\n\nConversely, suppose for every subgroup of $G$ is locally cyclic. Let $H$\nbe a subgroup generated by a finite subset of $G$. Since $H$ is locally\ncyclic, and $H$ itself is finitely generated, $H$ is cyclic, and\ntherefore $G$ is locally cyclic.",
