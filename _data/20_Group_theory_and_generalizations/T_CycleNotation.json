  "definition": "The cycle notation is a useful convention for writing down a\npermutations in terms of its constituent cycles. Let $S$ be a finite\nset, and $$a_1,\\ldots,a_k,\\quad k\\geq 2$$ distinct elements of $S$. The\nexpression $(a_1,\\ldots,a_k)$ denotes the cycle whose action is\n$$a_1\\mapsto a_2\\mapsto a_3\\ldots a_k \\mapsto a_1.$$ Note there are $k$\ndifferent expressions for the same cycle; the following all represent\nthe same cycle:\n$$(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_k) = (a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_k,a_1),=\\ldots =\n(a_k,a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{k-1}).$$ Also note that a 1-element cycle is the\nsame thing as the identity permutation, and thus there is not much point\nin writing down such things. Rather, it is customary to express the\nidentity permutation simply as $()$ or $(1)$.\n\nLet $\\pi$ be a permutation of $S$, and let\n$$S_1,\\ldots, S_k\\subset S,\\quad k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$$ be the orbits of\n$\\pi$ with more than 1 element. For each $j=1,\\ldots,k$ let $n_j$ denote\nthe cardinality of $S_j$. Also, choose an $a_{1,j}\\in S_j$, and define\n$$a_{i+1,j} = \\pi(a_{i,j}),\\quad i\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.$$ We can now express\n$\\pi$ as a product of disjoint cycles, namely\n$$\\pi = (a_{1,1},\\ldots a_{n_1,1}) (a_{2,1},\\ldots,a_{n_2,2}) \\ldots\n(a_{k,1},\\ldots,a_{n_k,k}).$$\n\nBy way of illustration, here are the 24 elements of the symmetric group\non $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ expressed using the cycle notation, and grouped\naccording to their conjugacy classes: $$\\begin{aligned}\n&(),\\\\\n&(12), \\;(13),\\; (14),\\; (23),\\; (24),\\; (34)\\\\\n&(123),\\; (213),\\; (124),\\; (214),\\; (134),\\; (143),\\; (234),\\;\n(243)\\\\\n&(12)(34),\\;(13)(24),\\; (14)(23)\\\\\n&(1234),\\; (1243),\\; (1324),\\; (1342),\\; (1423),\\; (1432)\\end{aligned}$$",
