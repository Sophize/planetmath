  "statement": "Assume, that $G$ and $H$ are groups. If $f:G\\to H$ is a group\nhomomorphism, then the first isomorphism theorem states, that the\nfunction $F:G/\\mathrm{ker}(f)\\to\\mathrm{im}(f)$ defined by\n$F(g\\mathrm{ker}(f))=f(g)$ is a well-defined group isomorphism. Note\nthat $\\mathrm{ker}(f)$ is always normal in $G$.\n\nThis leads to the following question: is there a correspondence between\nnormal subgroups of $G$ and homomorphic images of $G$? We will try to\nanswer this question, but before that, let us introduce some notion.\n\nFirst of all, homomorphic image $\\mathrm{im}(f)$ is not only a subgroup\nof $H$. Actually homomorphic image contains also some data about\nhomomorphism. This observation leads to the following definition:\n\n**Definition.** Let $G$ be a group. Pair $(H,f)$ is called *a\nhomomorphic image of $G$* iff $H$ is a group and $f:G\\to H$ is a\nsurjective group homomorphism. We will say that two homomorphic images\n$(H,f)$ and $(H',f')$ of $G$ are isomorphic (or equivalent), if there\nexists a group isomorphism $F:H\\to H'$ such that $F\\circ f=f'$.\n\nIt is easy to see, that this isomorphism relation is actually an\nequivalence relation and thus we may speak about isomorphism classes of\nhomomorphic images (which will be denoted by $[H,f]$ for homomorphic\nimage $(H,f)$). Furthermore, if $N\\subset G$ is a normal subgroup, then\n$(G/N,\\pi_{N})$ is a homomorphic image, where $\\pi_N:G\\to G/N$ is a\nprojection, i.e. $\\pi_N(g)=gN$. Let\n$$\\mathrm{norm}(G)=\\{N\\subseteq G\\ |\\ N\\mbox{ is normal subgroup}\\};$$\n$$\\mathrm{h.im}(G)=\\{[H,f]\\ |\\ (H,f)\\mbox{ is a homomorphic image of }G\\}.$$\n\n**Proposition.** Function $T:\\mathrm{norm}(G)\\to\\mathrm{h.im}(G)$\ndefined by $T(N)=[G/N,\\pi_N]$ is a bijection.\n\n*Proof.* First, we will show, that $T$ is onto. Let $(H,f)$ be a\nhomomorphic image of $G$. Let $N=\\mathrm{ker}(f)$. Then (due to the\nfirst isomorphism theorem), there exists a group isomorphism\n$F:G/N\\to H$ defined by $F(gN)=f(g)$. This shows, that\n$$f(g)=F(gN)=F(\\pi_N(g))=(F\\circ\\pi_N)(g)$$ and thus $(G/N,\\pi_N)$ is\nisomorphic to $(H,f)$. Therefore $$T(N)=[G/N,\\pi_N]=[H,f],$$ which\ncompletes this part.\n\nNow assume, that $T(N)=T(N')$ for some normal subgroups\n$N,N'\\in\\mathrm{norm}(G)$. This means, that $(G/N,\\pi_N)$ and\n$(G/N',\\pi_{N'})$ are isomorphic, i.e. there exists a group isomorphism\n$F:G/N\\to G/N'$ such that $F\\circ\\pi_N=\\pi_{N'}$. Let\n$x\\in N'=\\mathrm{ker}(\\pi_{N'})$ and denote by $e\\in G/N'$ the neutral\nelement. Then, we have $$e=\\pi_{N'}(x)=F(\\pi_N(x))$$ and (since $F$ is\nan isomorphism) this is if and only if $x\\in\\ker(\\pi_N)=N$. Thus, we\u2019ve\nshown that $N'\\subseteq N$. Analogously (after considering $F^{-1}$) we\nhave that $N\\subseteq N'$. Therefore $N=N'$, which shows, that $T$ is\ninjective. This completes the proof. $\\square$",
