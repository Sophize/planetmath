  "definition": "Let $G$ be a group. For any $a,b\\in G$, the element $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ is\ncalled the *commutator of $a$ and $b$*.\n\nThe commutator $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ is sometimes written $[a,b]$. (Usage\nvaries, however, and some authors instead use $[a,b]$ to represent the\ncommutator $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$.) If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $G$, then\n$[A,B]$ denotes the subgroup of $G$ generated by\n$\\{[a,b]\\mid a\\in A\\hbox{ and }b\\in B\\}$. This notation can be further\nextended by recursively defining\n$[X_1,\\dots,X_{n+1}]=[[X_1,\\dots,X_n],X_{n+1}]$ for subsets\n$X_1,\\dots,X_{n+1}$ of $G$.\n\nThe subgroup of $G$ generated by all the commutators in $G$ (that is,\nthe smallest subgroup of $G$ containing all the commutators) is called\nthe *derived subgroup*, or the *commutator subgroup*, of $G$. Using the\nnotation of the previous paragraph, the derived subgroup is denoted by\n$[G,G]$. Alternatively, it is often denoted by $G'$, or sometimes\n$G^{(1)}$.\n\nNote that $a$ and $b$ commute if and only if the commutator of\n$a,b\\in G$ is trivial, i.e., $$a^{-1} b^{-1}a b = 1.$$ Thus, in a\nfashion, the derived subgroup measures the degree to which a group fails\nto be abelian.\n\nThe derived subgroup $[G,G]$ is normal (in fact, fully invariant) in\n$G$, and the factor group $G/[G,G]$ is abelian. Moreover, $G$ is abelian\nif and only if $[G,G]$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nThe factor group $G/[G,G]$ is the largest abelian of $G$, and is called\nthe abelianization of $G$.\n\nOne can of course form the derived subgroup of the derived subgroup;\nthis is called the *second derived subgroup*, and denoted by $G''$ or\n$G^{(2)}$. Proceeding inductively one defines the $n{^{\\text{th}}}$\nderived subgroup $G^{(n)}$ as the derived subgroup of $G^{(n-1)}$. In\nthis fashion one obtains a sequence of subgroups, called the *derived\nseries* of $G$:\n$$G=G^{(0)} \\supseteq G^{(1)} \\supseteq G^{(2)} \\supseteq \\cdots$$\n\nThe group $G$ is solvable if and only if the derived series terminates\nin the trivial group $\\{ 1 \\}$ after a number of steps.\n\nThe derived series can also be continued transfinitely\u2014see the article\non the transfinite derived series.",
