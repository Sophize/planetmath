  "definition": "Let $S$ be a semigroup.\n\n$x\\in S$ is *regular* if there is a $y\\in S$ such that $x=xyx$.\\\n$y\\in S$ is an *inverse* (or a *relative inverse*) for $x$ if $x=xyx$\nand $y=yxy$.\n\nRegular semigroups\n==================\n\n$S$ is a *regular semigroup* if all its elements are regular. The phrase\n\u2019von Neumann regular\u2019 is sometimes used, after the definition for rings.\n\nIn a regular semigroup, every principal ideal is generated by an\nidempotent.\n\nEvery regular element has at least one inverse. To show this, suppose\n$a\\in S$ is regular, so that $a = aba$ for some $b\\in S$. Put $c=bab$.\nThen $$a=aba=(aba)ba=a(bab)a=aca$$ and\n$$c=bab=b(aba)b=(bab)ab=cab=c(aba)b=ca(bab)=cac,$$ so $c$ is an inverse\nof $a$.\n\nInverse semigroups\n==================\n\n$S$ is an *inverse semigroup* if for all $x\\in S$ there is a *unique*\n$y\\in S$ such that $x=xyx$ and $y=yxy$.\n\nIn an inverse semigroup every principal ideal is generated by a *unique*\nidempotent.\n\nIn an inverse semigroup the set of idempotents is a subsemigroup, in\nparticular a .\n\nThe bicyclic semigroup is an example of an inverse semigroup. The\nsymmetric inverse semigroup (on some set $X$) is another example. Of\ncourse, every group is also an inverse semigroup.\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\nBoth of these notions generalise the definition of a group. In\nparticular, a regular semigroup with one idempotent is a group: as such,\nmany interesting subclasses of regular semigroups arise from putting\nconditions on the idempotents. Apart from inverse semigroups, there are\n*orthodox semigroups* where the set of idempotents is a subsemigroup,\nand *Clifford semigroups* where the idempotents are central.\n\nAdditional\n==========\n\n$S$ is called *eventually regular* (or *$\\pi$-regular*) if a power of\nevery element is regular.\n\n$S$ is called *group-bound* (or *strongly $\\pi$-regular*, or an\n*epigroup*) if a power of every element is in a subgroup of $S$.\n\n$S$ is called *completely regular* if every element is in a subgroup of\n$S$.",
