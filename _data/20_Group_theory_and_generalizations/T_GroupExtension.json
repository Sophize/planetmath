  "definition": "Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. A group $E$ is called an *extension of $G$ by\n$H$* if\n\n1.  $G$ is isomorphic to a normal subgroup $N$ of $E$, and\n\n2.  $H$ is isomorphic to the quotient group $E/N$.\n\nThe definition is well-defined and it is convenient sometimes to regard\n$G$ as a normal subgroup of $E$. The definition can be alternatively\ndefined: $E$ is an extension of $G$ by $H$ if there is a short exact\nsequence of groups:\n$$1\\longrightarrow G\\longrightarrow E\\longrightarrow H\\longrightarrow 1.$$\nIn fact, some authors define an extension (of a group by a group) to be\na short exact sequence of groups described above. Also, many authors\nprefer the reverse terminology, calling the group $E$ an extension of\n$H$ by $G$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   Given any groups $G$ and $H$, an extension of $G$ by $H$ exists:\n    take the direct product of $G$ and $H$.\n\n-   An intermediate concept between an extension a direct product is\n    that of a *semidirect product* of two groups: If $G$ and $H$ are\n    groups, and $E$ is an extension of $G$ by $H$ (identifying $G$ with\n    a normal subgroup of $E$), then $E$ is called a semidirect product\n    of $G$ by $H$ if\n\n    1.  $H$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $E$, thus viewing $H$ as a\n        subgroup of $E$,\n\n    2.  $E=GH$, and\n\n    3.  $G\\cap H=\\langle1\\rangle$.\n\n    Equivalently, $E$ is a semidirect product of $G$ and $H$ if the\n    short exact sequence\n    $$1\\longrightarrow G\\longrightarrow E\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\longrightarrow} H\\longrightarrow 1$$\n    splits. That is, there is a group homomorphism $\\phi\\colon H\\to E$\n    such that the composition\n    $$H\\stackrel{\\phi}{\\longrightarrow}E\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\longrightarrow}H$$\n    gives the identity map. Thus, a semidirect product is also known as\n    a *split extension*. That a semidirect product $E$ of $G$ by $H$ is\n    also an extension of $G$ by $H$ can be seen via the isomorphism\n    $h\\mapsto hG$.\n\n    Furthermore, if $H$ happens to be normal in $E$, then $E$ is\n    isomorphic to the direct product of $G$ and $H$. (We need to show\n    that $(g,h)\\mapsto gh$ is an isomorphism. It is not hard to see that\n    the map is a bijection. The trick is to show that it is a\n    homomorphism, which boils down to showing that every element of $G$\n    commutes with every element of $H$. To show the last step, suppose\n    $ghg^{-1}=\\overline{h}\\in H$. Then $gh=\\overline{h}g$, so\n    $gh\\overline{h}^{-1}=\\overline{h}g\\overline{h}^{-1}= \\overline{g}\\in G$,\n    or that $h\\overline{h}^{-1}=g^{-1}\\overline{g}$. Therefore,\n    $h=\\overline{h}$.)\n\n-   The *extension problem* in group theory is the classification of all\n    extension groups of a given group $G$ by a given group $H$.\n    Specifically, it is a problem of finding all \u201cinequivalent\u201d\n    extensions of $G$ by $H$. Two extensions $E_1$ and $E_2$ of $G$ by\n    $H$ are *equivalent* if there is a homomorphism $e\\colon E_1\\to E_2$\n    such that the following diagram of two short exact sequences is\n    commutative:\n    $$\\xymatrix{1\\ar@{=}[d]\\ar[r]&G\\ar@{=}[d]\\ar[r]&E_1\\ar[d]^e\\ar[r]&H\\ar@{=}[d]\n    \\ar[r]&1\\ar@{=}[d]\\\\1\\ar[r]&G\\ar[r]&E_2\\ar[r]&H\\ar[r]&1.}$$\n    According to the 5-lemma, $e$ is actually an isomorphism. Thus\n    equivalences of extensions are well-defined.\n\n-   Like split extensions, special extensions are formed when certain\n    conditions are imposed on $G$, $H$, or even $E$:\n\n    1.  If all the groups involved are abelian (only that $E$ is abelian\n        is necessary here), then we have an *abelian extension*.\n\n    2.  If $G$, considered as a normal subgroup of $E$, actually lies\n        within the center of $E$, then $E$ is called a *central\n        extension*. A central extension that is also a semidirect\n        product is a direct product. Indeed, if $E$ is both a central\n        extension and a semidirect product of $G$ by $H$, we observe\n        that\n        $(g\\overline{h})h(g\\overline{h})^{-1}=\\overline{h}h\\overline{h}^{-1}\\in H$\n        so that $H$ is normal in $E$. Applying this result to the\n        previous discussion and we have $E\\cong G\\times H$.\n\n    3.  If $G$ is a cyclic group, then the extensions in question are\n        called *cyclic extensions*.",
