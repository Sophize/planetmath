  "definition": "A group is said to satisfy the *normalizer condition* if every proper\nsubgroup is properly contained in its own normalizer. That is, a group\n$G$ satisfies the normalizer condition if and only if $H<N_G(H)$ for all\n$H<G$. A group that satisfies the normalizer condition is sometimes\ncalled an *N-group*.\n\nEvery nilpotent group is an N-group, and every N-group is locally\nnilpotent. In particular, a finitely generated group is an N-group if\nand only if it is nilpotent.\n\nA group satisfies the normalizer condition if and only if all its\nsubgroups are ascendant.",
