  "definition": "The [*order*]{} of a group $G$ is the number of elements of $G$, denoted\n$|G|$; if $|G|$ is finite, then $G$ is said to be a [*finite group*]{}.\n\nThe [*order*]{} of an element $g \\in G$ is the smallest positive integer\n$n$ such that $g^n=e$, where $e$ is the identity element; if there is no\nsuch $n$, then $g$ is said to be of [*infinite order*]{}. By Lagrange\u2019s\ntheorem, the order of any element in a finite group divides the order of\nthe group.",
