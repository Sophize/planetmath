  "statement": "If a group $G$ is simple, and $H$ is an arbitrary group then any\nhomomorphism of $G$ to $H$ must either map all elements of $G$ to the\nidentity of $H$ or be one-to-one.\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism must be a normal subgroup. Since $G$ is\nsimple, there are only two possibilities: either the kernel is all of\n$G$ of it consists of the identity. In the former case, the homomorphism\nwill map all elements of $G$ to the identity. In the latter case, we\nnote that a group homomorphism is injective iff the kernel is trivial.\n\nThis is important in the context of representation theory. In that case,\n$H$ is a linear group and this result may be restated as saying that\nrepresentations of a simple group are either trivial or faithful.",
