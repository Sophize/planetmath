  "definition": "A semigroup which is generated by a single element is called a *cyclic\nsemigroup*.\n\nLet $S = \\langle x \\rangle$ be a cyclic semigroup. Then as a set,\n$S = \\{ x^n \\mid n > 0\\}$.\n\nIf all powers of $x$ are distinct, then $S = \\{x, x^2, x^3, \\dotsc \\}$\nis (countably) infinite.\n\nOtherwise, there is a least integer $n > 0$ such that $x^n = x^m$ for\nsome $m < n$. It is clear then that the elements\n$x, x^2, \\dots, x^{n-1}$ are distinct, but that for any $j \\ge n$, we\nmust have $x^j = x^i$ for some $i$, $m \\le i \\le n-1$. So $S$ has $n-1$\nelements.\n\nUnlike in the group case, however, there are in general multiple\nnon-isomorphic cyclic semigroups with the same number of elements. In\nfact, there are $t$ non-isomorphic cyclic semigroups with $t$ elements:\nthese correspond to the different choices of $m$ in the above (with\n$n = t+1$).\n\nThe integer $m$ is called the *index* of $S$, and $n-m$ is called the\n*period* of $S$.\n\nThe elements $K = \\{x^m, x^{m+1}, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}$ are a subsemigroup\nof $S$. In fact, $K$ is a cyclic group.\n\nA concrete representation of the semigroup with index $m$ and period $r$\nas a semigroup of transformations can be obtained as follows. Let\n$X = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, m + r\\}$. Let $$\\phi =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & \\dots & m+r-1 & m+r \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4 & \\dots & m+r & r+1\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nThen $\\phi$ generates a subsemigroup $S$ of the full semigroup of\ntransformations $\\mathcal{T}_X$, and $S$ is cyclic with index $m$ and\nperiod $r$.",
