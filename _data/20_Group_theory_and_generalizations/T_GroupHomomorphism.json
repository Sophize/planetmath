  "definition": "Let $(G,\\ast)$ and $(K,\\star)$ be two groups. A *group homomorphism* is\na function $\\phi\\colon G \\to K$ such that\n$\\phi (s \\ast t) = \\phi(s) \\star \\phi(t)$ for all $s,t \\in G$.\n\nA composition of group homomorphisms is again a homomorphism.\n\nLet $\\phi\\colon G\\to K$ a group homomorphism. Then the kernel of $\\phi$\nis a normal subgroup of $G$, and the image of $\\phi$ is a subgroup of\n$K$. Also, $\\phi(g^n)=\\phi(g)^n$ for all $g\\in G$ and for all $n \\in\\Z$.\nIn particular, taking $n=-1$ we have $\\phi(g^{-1})=\\phi(g)^{-1}$ for all\n$g \\in G$, and taking $n=0$ we have $\\phi(1_G)=1_K$, where $1_G$ and\n$1_K$ are the identity elements of $G$ and $K$, respectively.\n\nSome special homomorphisms have special names. If the homomorphism\n$\\phi\\colon G\\to K$ is injective, we say that $\\phi$ is a\n*monomorphism*, and if $\\phi$ is surjective we call it an *epimorphism*.\nWhen $\\phi$ is both injective and surjective (that is, bijective) we\ncall it an *isomorphism*. In the latter case we also say that $G$ and\n$K$ are *isomorphic*, meaning they are basically the same group (have\nthe same structure). A homomorphism from $G$ on itself is called an\n*endomorphism*, and if it is bijective then it is called an\n*automorphism*.",
