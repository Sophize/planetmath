  "definition": "Let $G$ be a groupoid, that is a set with a binary operation\n$G \\times G \\to G$, written muliplicatively so that $(x, y) \\mapsto xy$.\n\nAn *identity element* for $G$ is an element $e$ such that $ge = eg = g$\nfor all $g \\in G$.\n\nThe symbol $e$ is most commonly used for identity elements. Another\ncommon symbol for an identity element is $1$, particularly in semigroup\ntheory (and ring theory, considering the multiplicative structure as a\nsemigroup).\n\nGroups, monoids, and loops are classes of groupoids that, by definition,\nalways have an identity element.",
