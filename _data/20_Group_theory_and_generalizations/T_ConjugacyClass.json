  "definition": "Two elements $g$ and $g'$ of a group $G$ are said to be [*conjugate*]{}\nif there exists $h \\in G$ such that $g' = hgh^{-1}$. Conjugacy of\nelements is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes of $G$\nare called [*conjugacy classes*]{}.\n\nTwo subsets $S$ and $T$ of $G$ are said to be [*conjugate*]{} if there\nexists $g \\in G$ such that $$T = \\{gsg^{-1} \\mid s \\in S\\} \\subset G.$$\nIn this situation, it is common to write $gSg^{-1}$ for $T$ to denote\nthe fact that everything in $T$ has the form $gsg^{-1}$ for some\n$s \\in S$. We say that two subgroups of $G$ are conjugate if they are\nconjugate as subsets.",
