  "statement": "The symmetric group on $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ is generated by the\npermutations $$(1, 2), (2, 3), \\ldots, (n-1, n).$$\n\nWe proceed by induction on $n$. If $n = 2$, the theorem is trivially\ntrue because the the group only consists of the identity and a single\ntransposition.\n\nSuppose, then, that we know permutations of $n$ numbers are generated by\ntranspositions of successive numbers. Let $\\phi$ be a permutation of\n$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$. If $\\phi(n+1) = n+1$, then the restriction of\n$\\phi$ to $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ is a permutation of $n$ numbers, hence,\nby hypothesis, it can be expressed as a product of transpositions.\n\nSuppose that, in addition, $\\phi (n+1) = m$ with $m \\neq n+1$. Consider\nthe following product of transpositions:\n$$(n n+1) (n-1 n) \\cdots (m+1 m+1) (m m+1)$$ It is easy to see that\nacting upon $m$ with this product of transpositions produces $+1$.\nTherefore, acting upon $n+1$ with the permutation\n$$(n n+1) (n-1 n) \\cdots (m+1 m+1) (m m+1) \\phi$$ produces $n+1$. Hence,\nthe restriction of this permutation to $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ is a\npermutation of $n$ numbers, so, by hypothesis, it can be expressed as a\nproduct of transpositions. Since a transposition is its own inverse, it\nfollows that $\\phi$ may also be expressed as a product of\ntranspositions.",
