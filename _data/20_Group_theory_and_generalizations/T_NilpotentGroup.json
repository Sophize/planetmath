  "definition": "We define the [*lower central series*]{} of a group $G$ to be the\nfiltration of subgroups $$G = G^1 \\supset G^2 \\supset \\cdots$$ defined\ninductively by: $$\\begin{aligned}\nG^1 & := & G, \\\\\nG^i & := & [G^{i-1},G],\\ \\ i>1,\\end{aligned}$$ where $[G^{i-1},G]$\ndenotes the subgroup of $G$ generated by all commutators of the form\n$hkh^{-1}k^{-1}$ where $h \\in G^{i-1}$ and $k \\in G$. The group $G$ is\nsaid to be [*nilpotent*]{} if $G^i = 1$ for some $i$.\n\nNilpotent groups can also be equivalently defined by means of upper\ncentral series. For a group $G$, the [*upper central series*]{} of $G$\nis the filtration of subgroups\n$$C_0 \\subset C_1 \\subset C_2 \\subset \\cdots$$ defined by setting $C_0$\nto be the trivial subgroup of $G$, and inductively taking $C_i$ to be\nthe unique subgroup of $G$ such that $C_i/C_{i-1}$ is the center of\n$G/C_{i-1}$, for each $i > 1$. The group $G$ is nilpotent if and only if\n$G = C_i$ for some $i$. Moreover, if $G$ is nilpotent, then the length\nof the upper central series (i.e., the smallest $i$ for which $G=C_i$)\nequals the length of the lower central series (i.e., the smallest $i$\nfor which $G^{i+1}=1$).\n\nThe *nilpotency class* or *nilpotent class* of a nilpotent group is the\nlength of the lower central series (equivalently, the length of the\nupper central series).\n\nNilpotent groups are related to nilpotent Lie algebras in that a Lie\ngroup is nilpotent as a group if and only if its corresponding Lie\nalgebra is nilpotent. The analogy extends to solvable groups as well:\nevery nilpotent group is solvable, because the upper central series is a\nfiltration with abelian quotients.",
