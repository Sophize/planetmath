  "definition": "Brandt groupoids, like , are generalizations of groups, where a\nmultiplication is defined, and inverses with respect to the\nmultiplication exist for each element. However, unlike elements of a\ngroup, each element in a Brandt groupoid behaves like an arrow, with a\nsource and target, and multiplication of two elements only work when the\ntarget of the first element coincides with the source of the second\nelement.\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nA *Brandt groupoid* is a non-empty set $B$, together with a partial\nbinary operation (called a multiplication) $\\cdot$ defined on it (we\nwrite $ab$ for $a\\cdot b$), such that\n\n1.  For every $a\\in B$, there are unique elements $e,f$ such that $ea$\n    and $af$ are defined, and is equal to $a$.\n\n2.  If $ae=a$ or $ea=a$ for some $a,e\\in B$, then $ee$ is defined, and\n    is equal to $e$.\n\n3.  For $a,b\\in B$, $ab$ is defined iff there is an $e\\in B$ such that\n    $ae=a$ and $eb=b$.\n\n4.  For $a,b,c\\in B$ such that $ab$ and $bc$ are defined, then so are\n    $(ab)c$ and $a(bc)$ and they equal.\n\n5.  If $ea=af=e$ for some $a,e,f\\in B$, then there is a $b\\in B$ such\n    that $ab$ and $ba$ are defined and $ab=e$ and $ba=f$.\n\n6.  If $ee=e$ and $ff=f$ for some $e,f\\in B$, then there is $a\\in B$\n    such that $ea$ and $af$ are defined and are equal to $a$.\n\nIn the definition above, we see several instances of elements $e$ such\nthat $e^2=ee=e$. Such elements are called *idempotents*. If we let $I$\nbe the set of all idempotents of $B$, then $I\\ne \\varnothing$ by\nconditions 1 and 2.\n\n### Brandt Groupoids versus Categories {#brandt-groupoids-versus-categories .unnumbered}\n\nBrandt groupoids are intimately related to categories, as we will\npresently discuss.\n\nThe first two conditions above imply that there are two surjective\nfunctions $s,t:B\\to I$, where $t(a)$ and $s(a)$ are the unique\nidempotents such that $a s(a)=a$ and $t(a) a=a$. In addition,\n$s(e)=t(e)=e$ for all $e\\in I$. Call $s$ the source function, $t$ the\ntarget function, and for any $a\\in B$, $s(a),t(a)$ the source and the\ntarget of $a$.\n\nThe third condition says that $ab$ is defined iff the source of $a$ is\nthe equal to the target of $b$: $s(a)=t(b)$. The fourth condition is the\nassociativity law for the multiplication. An easy consequence of this\ncondition is that if $ab$ exists, then $s(b)=s(ab)$ and $t(a)=t(ab)$.\n\nAltogether, the first four conditions say that a $B$ is a small\ncategory, with $I$ its set of objects, and $G$ the set of morphisms, and\ncomposition of morphisms is just the multiplication.\n\nA morphism $a$ in $B$ is said to be an *isomorphism* if there is a\nmorphism $b$ in $G$ such that $ab,ba \\in I$. Now, $b$ is uniquely\ndetermined by $a$, so that $a$ is an isomorphism in the category\ntheoretic sense.\n\nFirst notice that $s(b)=s(ab)=ab=t(ab)=t(a)$ and\n$t(b)=t(ba)=ba=s(ba)=s(a)$. If $ac, ca \\in I$, then $s(c)=t(a)=s(b)$ and\n$t(c)=s(a)=t(b)$. So $ab=ac$ and $ba=bc$. As a result,\n$c=t(c)c = t(b)c= (ba)c=b(ac)= b(ab)= b s(b)=b$.\n\n$b$ is said to be the inverse of $a$, and is often written $a^{-1}$.\nCondition 5 says that the category $B$ is in fact a . Thus, a Brandt\ngroupoid is a group if the multiplication is everywhere defined.\n\nFinally, condition 6 says that between every pair of objects, there is a\nmorphism from one to the other, this is equivalent to saying that $B$ is\nstrongly connected. As a result, a Brandt groupoid may be equivalently\ndefined as a small strongly connected groupoid (in the category\ntheoretic sense).\n\n### An Example {#an-example .unnumbered}\n\nA Brandt groupoid may be constructed as follows: take a group $G$ and a\nnon-empty set $I$, set $B:=I\\times G\\times I$, and define multiplication\non $B$ as follows: $$(p,x,q)(r,y,s) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n(p,xy,s) & \\textrm{if }q=r,\\\\\n\\textrm{undefined} & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ Then $B$ with the partial multiplication is a Brandt groupoid.\nThe idempotents in $B$ have the form $(p,e,p)$, where $e\\in G$ is the\ngroup identity. And for any $(p,x,q)$, its source, target, and inverse\nare $(q,e,q)$ and $(p,e,p)$, $(q,x^{-1},p)$ respectively.\n\nIn fact, it may be shown that every Brandt groupoid is isomorphic to one\nconstructed above (for a proof, see ).\n\n**Remark**. A non-trivial Brandt groupoid can not have a zero element,\nfor if $0a=a0=0$ for all $a\\in B$, then $a$ must be the source and\ntarget of $0$, but then $a$ would have to be unique by condition 1,\nwhich is impossible unless $B$ is trivial. If we adjoin $0$ to a Brandt\ngroupoid $B$, and call $S:=B\\cup \\lbrace 0\\rbrace$, then $S$ has the\nstructure of a semigroup. Here\u2019s how the multiplication is defined on\n$S$: $$ab = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nab & \\textrm{if $ab$ is defined in $B$},\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise, or if either $a=0$ or $b=0$}.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ Since the multiplication on $S$ is everywhere defined, $S$ is\na groupoid. To see that $S$ is a semigroup, we must show that\nassociativity of the multiplication applies everywhere. There are four\ncases\n\n-   If both $ab$ and $bc$ are defined in $B$, they are certainly defined\n    in $S$, and the associativity follows from condition 4.\n\n-   If neither $ab$ nor $bc$ is defined in $B$, then\n    $(ab)c=0c=0=a0=a(bc)$ in $S$.\n\n-   If $ab$ is not defined in $B$, but $bc$ is, then\n    $s(a)\\ne t(b)=t(bc)$, and $(ab)c=0c=0=a(bc)$.\n\n-   Similarly, if $ab$ is defined in $B$ but not $bc$, then\n    $(ab)c=0=a(bc)$.\n\nThus, $S$ is a semigroup (with $0$). In fact, Clifford showed that $S$\nis completely simple.\n\n[9]{} H. Brandt, *Uber die Axiome des Gruppoids, Vierteljschr.\nnaturforsch. Ges.
