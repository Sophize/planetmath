  "definition": "Given an alphabet $\\Sigma$, recall that a regular language $R$ is a\ncertain subset of the free monoid $M$ generated by $\\Sigma$, which can\nbe obtained by taking singleton subsets of $\\Sigma$, and perform, in a\nfinite number of steps, any of the three basic operations: taking union,\nstring concatenation, and the Kleene star.\n\nThe construction of a set like $R$ is still possible without $M$ being\nfinitely generated free.\n\nLet $M$ be a monoid, and $\\mathcal{S}_M$ the set of all singleton\nsubsets of $M$. Consider the closure $\\mathcal{R}_M$ of $S$ under the\noperations of union, product, and the formation of a submonoid of $M$.\nIn other words, $\\mathcal{R}_M$ is the smallest subset of $M$ such that\n\n-   $\\varnothing\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$,\n\n-   $A,B\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$ imply $A\\cup B \\in \\mathcal{R}_M$,\n\n-   $A,B\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$ imply $AB\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$, where\n    $AB=\\lbrace ab\\mid a\\in A,b\\in B\\rbrace$,\n\n-   $A\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$ implies $A^*\\in \\mathcal{R}_M$, where $A^*$ is\n    the submonoid generated by $A$.\n\n**Definition**. A *rational set* of $M$ is an element of\n$\\mathcal{R}_M$.\n\nIf $M$ is a finite generated free monoid, then a rational set of $M$ is\nalso called a *rational language*, more commonly known as a *regular\nlanguage*.\n\nLike regular languages, rational sets can also be represented by regular\nexpressions. A regular expression over a monoid $M$ and the set it\nrepresents are defined inductively as follows:\n\n-   $\\varnothing$ and $a$ are regular expressions, for any $a\\in M$,\n    representing sets $\\varnothing$ and $\\lbrace a\\rbrace$ respectively.\n\n-   if $a,b$ are regular expressions, so are $a\\cup b$, $ab$, and $a^*$.\n    Furthermore, if $a,b$ represent sets $A,B$, then $a\\cup b$, $ab$,\n    and $a^*$ represent sets $A\\cup B$, $AB$, and $A^*$ respectively.\n\nParentheses are used, as usual, to avoid ambiguity.\n\nFrom the definition above, it is easy to see that a set $A\\subseteq M$\nis rational iff it can be represented by a regular expression over $M$.\n\nBelow are some basic properties of rational sets:\n\n1.  Any rational set $M$ is a subset of a finitely generated submonoid\n    of $M$. As a result, every rational set over $M$ is finite iff $M$\n    is locally finite (meaning every finitely generated submonoid of $M$\n    is actually finite).\n\n2.  Rationality is preserved under homomorphism: if $A$ is rational over\n    $M$ and $f:M\\to N$ is a homomorphism, then $f(A)$ is rational over\n    $N$.\n\n3.  Conversely, if $B\\in f(M)$ is rational over $N$, then there is a\n    rational set $A$ over $M$ such that $f(A)=B$. Thus if $f$ is onto,\n    every rational set over $N$ is mapped by a rational set over $M$. If\n    $f$ fails to be onto, the statement becomes false. In fact, inverse\n    homomorphisms generally do not preserve rationality.\n\n[8]{} S. Eilenberg, [*Automata, Languages, and Machines, Vol. A*]{},\nAcademic Press (1974).",
