  "definition": "The Mathieu groups are a of 5 sporadic simple groups discovered by the\nFrench mathematician \u00c9mile L\u00e9onard Mathieu. They are usually denoted by\n$M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$, $M_{24}$. They are defined as\nautomorphism groups of certain Steiner systems, and the subscript\ndenotes the size of the underlying set of the Steiner system.\n\nIf $\\Omega$ is a set of $n$ elements, then a $(t,k,n)$-Steiner system on\n$\\Omega$ is a set $S$ of subsets of $\\Omega$, each of size $k$, such\nthat every subset of $\\Omega$ of size $t$ is contained in a unique\nelement of $S$. The automorphism group of the Steiner system is defined\nas the permutations of $\\Omega$ which map $S$ to itself.\n\nThere exists a (5,8,24)-Steiner system, and it is unique up to\npermutation of the elements of $\\Omega$. It can be constructed as the\nset of octads of the extended binary Golay Code ${\\mathcal{G}_{24}}$. We\ndenote it by $S(5,8,24)$ below.\n\nThere exists a (5,6,12)-Steiner system, and it is unique up to\npermutation of the elements. It can be constructed as follows. Take\n$\\Omega'$ to be a dodecad (element of weight 12) of\n${\\mathcal{G}_{24}}$. Then the subsets of size 6 in $\\Omega'$ which are\ncontained in an octad of ${\\mathcal{G}_{24}}$ form a (5,6,12)-Steiner\nsystem. We denote it by $S(5,6,12)$ below.\n\nDefinition of the Mathieu groups\n================================\n\nThe group $M_{24}$ is the automorphism group of $S(5,8,24)$. It has\norder\n$244\\,823\\,040 = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$.\n\nThe group $M_{23}$ is the subgroup of $M_{24}$ fixing a given of\n$\\Omega$. It is the automorphism group of a (4,7,23)-Steiner system). It\nhas order\n$|M_{24}|/24 = 10\\,200\\,960 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$.\n\nThe group $M_{22}$ is the subgroup of $M_{24}$ fixing two given of\n$\\Omega$. It is a subgroup of 2 in the automorphism group of a\n(3,6,22)-Steiner system. It has order\n$|M_{23}|/23 = 443\\,250 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$.\n\nThe group $M_{12}$ is the automorphism group of $S(5,6,12)$. It has\norder $95\\,040 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$.\n\nThe group $M_{11}$ is the subgroup of $M_{12}$ fixing a of $\\Omega'$. It\nis the automorphism group of a (4,5,11)-Steiner system. It has order\n$|M_{12}/12| = 7\\,920 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$.\n\nFor further on the Mathieu groups, consult the ([@splag], Chapters 10\nand 11) and ([@sporadic], Chapters 5-7).\n\n*Note.* It is possible to continue the pattern above and define groups\n$M_{21}$, $M_{20}$, $M_{10}$, $M_9$, $M_8$. However, they are no longer\nsporadic simple groups. The group $M_{21}$ is a subgroup of 3! = 6 in\nthe automorphism group of a (2,5,21)-Steiner system, which are the\npoints and lines of the projective plane over the field of 4 elements.\nIn fact, $M_{21} \\cong PSL(3,\\mathbb{F}_4)$, a . The group $M_{20}$ is a\nsolvable group. The group $M_{10}$ is not simple; it contains, with 2,\nthe alternating group $A_6$ (sometimes denoted $M_{10}'$ in this context\nsince it is the derived subgroup of $M_{10}$). The groups $M_9$ and\n$M_8$ are solvable.\n\n[9]{} J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane. Sphere Packings, Lattices, and\nGroups. Springer-Verlag, 1999. Robert L. Griess, Jr. Twelve Sporadic\nGroups.
