Since $\\Gamma$ acts freely on $T$, the\nquotient graph $T/\\Gamma$ is well-defined, and $T$ is the universal\ncover of $T/\\Gamma$ since $T$ is contractible. Thus by faithfulness\n$\\Gamma\\cong\\pi_1(X/\\Gamma)$. Since any graph is homotopy equivalent to\na wedge of circles, and the fundamental group of such a space is free by\nVan Kampen\u2019s theorem, $\\Gamma$ is free.",
