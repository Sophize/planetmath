  "definition": "Let $G$ be a finite group with order $n$, and let $p$ be a prime\ninteger. We can write $n=p^k m$ for some $k,m$ integers, such that $k$\nand $m$ are coprimes (that is, $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ that\ndivides $n$). Any subgroup of $G$ whose order is $p^k$ is called a Sylow\n$p$-subgroup.\n\nWhile there is no reason for Sylow $p$-subgroups to exist for any finite\ngroup, the fact is that all groups have Sylow $p$-subgroups for every\nprime $p$ that divides $|G|$. This statement is the First Sylow theorem\n\nWhen $|G|=p^k$ we simply say that $G$ is a $p$-group.",
