  "definition": "[*Quasiconformal mappings*]{} are mappings of the complex plane to\nitself that are \u201calmost\u201d conformal. That is, they do not distort angles\narbitrarily and this \u201cdistortion\u201d is uniformly bounded throughout their\ndomain of definition. Alternatively one can think of quasiconformal\nmappings as mappings which take infinitesimal circles to infinitesimal\nellipses. For example invertible linear maps are quasiconformal.\n\nMore rigorously, suppose $f$ is a mapping of the complex plane to\nitself, and here we will only consider sense-preserving mappings, that\nis mappings with a positive jacobian.\n\nDefine the [*dilatation*]{} of the mapping $f$ at the point $z$ as\n$$D_f(z) := \\frac{\\lvert f_z \\rvert + \\lvert f_{\\bar{z}} \\rvert}{\\lvert f_z \\rvert-\\lvert f_{\\bar{z}}\\rvert} \\geq 1 ,$$\nand define the [*maximal dilatation*]{} of the mapping as\n$$K_f := \\sup_z D_f(z) .$$\n\nNow we are ready to define what it means for $f$ to be quasiconformal.\n\nFor $f$ as above, we will call $f$ [*quasiconformal*]{} if the maximal\ndilatation of $f$ is finite. We will say that $f$ is $K$-quasiconformal\nmapping if the maximal dilatation of this mapping is $K$.\n\nNote that sometimes the $K$-quasiconformal is used to that the\ndilatation is $K$ or lower.\n\nIt is easy to see that a conformal sense-preserving mapping has a\ndilatation of $1$ since $\\lvert f_{\\bar{z}} \\rvert = 0$. We can further\ndefine several other related quantities\n\nFor $f$ as above, define the [*small dilatation*]{} as\n$$d_f(z) := \\frac{\\lvert f_{\\bar{z}} \\rvert}{\\lvert f_z \\rvert} .$$\n\nAgain for sense-preserving maps this quantity is less then 1 and it is\nequal to 0 if the mapping is conformal. Some authors call a map\n$k$-quasiconformal if the small dilatation is bounded by $k$. It is\nhowever not ambiguous as the large dilatation is always greater then or\nequal to 1. Furthermore this is related to the large dilatation by\n$$d_f := \\frac{D_f-1}{D_f+1} .$$\n\nFor $f$ as above, define the [*complex dilatation*]{} as\n$$\\mu_f(z) := \\frac{f_{\\bar{z}}}{f_z} .$$\n\nThe complex dilatation now appears in the Beltrami differential equation\n$$f_{\\bar{z}}(z) = \\mu_f(z)f_z(z) .$$ This means that a quasiconformal\nmapping is a solution to the Beltrami equation where a non-negative\nmeasurable $\\mu_f$ is uniformly bounded by some $k < 1$.\n\nThe above results are stated for\n$f\\colon {\\mathbb{C}} \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$, but the statements are exactly\nthe same if you take $f\\colon G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}} \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$\nfor an open set $G$.\n\nThe theory generalizes to other dimensions as well. For example in one\nreal dimension, the analogous mappings are called quasisymmetric. It is\na well-known that an of a mapping of the real line to itself is\nquasiconformal if and only if the mapping is quasisymmetric.\n\n[9]{} L. V. Ahlfors. **.
