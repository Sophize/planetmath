  "statement": "There are several different statements of this theorem, but in essence\nthis theorem will allow us to prescribe zeros and their orders of a\nholomorphic function. It also allows us to factor any holomorphic\nfunction into a product of zeros and a non-zero holomorphic function. We\nwill need to know here how an infinite product converges. It can then be\nshown that if $\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty f_k(z)$ converges uniformly and on\ncompact subsets, then it converges to a holomorphic function given that\nall the $f_k(z)$ are holomorphic. This is what we will by the infinite\nproduct in what follows.\n\nNote that once we can prescribe zeros of a function then we can also\nprescribe the poles as well and get a meromorphic function just by\ndividing two holomorphic functions $f/h$ where $f$ will contribute\nzeros, and $h$ will make poles at the points where $h(z) = 0$. So let\u2019s\nstart with the existence statement.\n\nLet $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a domain, let $\\{a_k\\}$ be a sequence of\npoints in $G$ with no accumulation points in $G$, and let $\\{n_k\\}$ be\nany sequence of non-zero integers (positive or negative). Then there\nexists a function $f$ meromorphic in $G$ whose poles and zeros are\nexactly at the points $a_k$ and the order of the pole or zero at $a_k$\nis $n_k$ (a positive order stands for zero, negative stands for pole).\n\nNext let\u2019s look at a more specific statement with more . For one let\u2019s\nstart looking at the whole complex plane and further let\u2019s forget about\npoles for now to make the following formulas simpler.\n\nWe call $$\\begin{aligned}\nE_0(z) & := 1-z,\n\\\\\nE_p(z) & := (1-z) e^{z+\\frac{1}{2}z^2 + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{p} z^p} \\qquad \\text{for $p \\geq 1$},\\end{aligned}$$\nan [*elementary factor*]{}.\n\nNow note that for some $a \\in {\\mathbb{C}} \\backslash \\{ 0 \\}$,\n$E_p(z/a)$ has a zero (zero of order 1) at $a$.\n\nSuppose $f$ be an entire function and let $\\{ a_k \\}$ be the zeros of\n$f$ such that $a_k \\not= 0$ (the non-zero zeros of $f$). Let $m$ be the\norder of the zero of $f$ at $z=0$ ($m=0$ if $f$ does not have a zero at\n$z=0$). Then there exists an entire function $g$ and a sequence of\nnon-negative integers $\\{ p_k \\}$ such that\n$$f(z) = z^m e^{g(z)} \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty E_{p_k} \\left( \\frac{z}{a_k} \\right) .$$\n\nNote that we can always choose $p_k = k-1$ and the product above will\nconverge as needed, but we may be able to choose better $p_k$ for\nspecific functions.\n\nAs an example we can try to factorize the function $\\sin (\\pi z)$, which\nhas zeros at all the integers. Applying the Weierstrass factorization\ntheorem directly we get that $$\\sin (\\pi z) =\nz e^{g(z)} \\prod_{k = -\\infty, k \\not= 0}^\\infty \\left( 1 - \\frac{z}{k} \\right) e^{z/k},$$\nwhere $g(z)$ is some holomorphic function. It turns out that\n$e^{g(z)} = \\pi$, and rearranging the product we get $$\\sin (\\pi z) =\nz \\pi \\prod_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( 1 - \\frac{z^2}{k^2} \\right) .$$ This\nis an example where we could choose the $p_k = 1$ for all $k$ and thus\nwe could then get rid of the ugly parts of the infinite product.
