  "statement": "In the we see that a rational function has as its only singularities a\nfinite set of poles. It is also valid the converse\n\n**Theorem.** Any single-valued analytic function, which has in the whole\nclosed complex plane no other singularities than poles, is a rational\nfunction.\\\n[*Proof.*]{} Suppose that $z\\mapsto w(z)$ is such an analytic function.\nThe number of the poles of $w$ must be finite, since otherwise the set\nof the poles would have in the closed complex plane an accumulation\npoint which is neither a nor a pole. Let $b_1,\\,b_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,b_k$ and\npossibly $\\infty$ be the poles of the function $w$.\n\nFor every $i = 1,\\,2,\\,\\ldots,\\,k$, the function has at the pole $b_i$\nwith the order $n_i$, the Laurent expansion of the form\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  w(z) = \\frac{c_{-n_i}}{(z-b_i)^{n_i}}+\\frac{c_{-n_i+1}}{(z-b_i)^{n_i-1}}+\\ldots+c_0+c_1(z-b_i)+\\ldots\\end{aligned}$$\nThis is in in the greatest open disc containing no other poles. We write\n(1) as $$\\begin{aligned}\n  w(z) = F_{n_i}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-b_i}\\right)+P(z-b_i),\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere the first addend is the principal part of (1), i.e. consists of\nthe terms of (1) which become infinite in $z = b_i$.\n\nIf we think a circle having center in the origin and containing all the\nfinite poles $b_i$ (an annulus $\\varrho < |z| < \\infty$), then $w(z)$\nhas outside it the Laurent series expansion\n$$w(z) = d_mz^m+d_{m-1}z^{m-1}+\\ldots+d_0+\\frac{d_{-1}}{z}+\\ldots,$$\nwhich we write, corresponding to (2), as $$\\begin{aligned}\n  w(z) = G_m(z)+Q\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\!,\\end{aligned}$$ where\n$G_m(z)$ is a polynomial of $z$ and $Q\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$ a power\nseries in $\\frac{1}{z}$. Then the equation\n$$R(z)\\, := \\sum_{i=1}^kF_{n_i}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-b_i}\\right)+G_m(z)$$\ndefines a rational function having the same poles as $w$. Therefore the\nfunction defined by $$f(z)\\, :=\\, w(z)-R(z)$$ is everywhere except\npossibly at the points $z = b_i$ and $z = \\infty$. If we write $$f(z) = \n\\left[w(z)-F_{n_i}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-b_i}\\right)\\right]-\\sum_{j\\neq i}F_{n_j}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-b_j}\\right)-G_m(z),$$\nwe see that $f(z)$ is bounded in a neighbourhood of the point $b_i$ and\nis analytic also in this point ($i = 1,\\,2,\\,\\ldots,\\,k$). But then\nagain, the $$f(z) = \n\\left[w(z)-G_m(z)\\right]-\\sum_{j=1}^kF_{n_j}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{z-b_j}\\right)$$\nshows that $f$ is analytic in the , too. Thus $f$ is analytic in the\nwhole closed complex plane. By Liouville\u2019s theorem, $f$ is a constant\nfunction. We conclude that $R(z)+f(z) = w(z)$ is a rational function.\nQ.E.D.\\\nThe theorem implies, that if a meromorphic function is regular at\ninfinity or has there a pole, then it is a rational function.\n\n[9]{} : [*Funktioteoria*]{}.
