  "definition": "Let $(\\lambda_n)_{n\\ge 1}$ be an increasing sequence of positive real\nnumbers tending to $\\infty$. A *Dirichlet series* with exponents\n$(\\lambda_n)$ is a series of the form $$\\sum_n a_n e^{-\\lambda_nz}$$\nwhere $z$ and all the $a_n$ are complex numbers.\n\nAn *ordinary Dirichlet series* is one having $\\lambda_n=\\log n$ for all\n$n$. It is written $$\\sum\\frac{a_n}{n^z}\\;.$$ The best-known examples\nare the Riemann zeta function (in which $a_n$ is the $1$) and the more\ngeneral Dirichlet L-series (in which the mapping $n\\mapsto a_n$ is\nmultiplicative and periodic).\n\nWhen $\\lambda_n=n$, the Dirichlet series is just a power series in the\nvariable $e^{-z}$.\n\nThe following are the basic convergence properties of Dirichlet series.\nThere is nothing profound about their proofs, which can be found in\n[@cite:serre_arithm_course_vi] and in various other works on complex\nanalysis and analytic number theory.\n\nLet $f(z)=\\sum_n a_n e^{-\\lambda_nz}$ be a Dirichlet series.\n\n1.  If $f$ converges at $z=z_0$, then $f$ converges uniformly in the\n    region $$\\Re(z-z_0)\\ge 0\\qquad -\\alpha\\le\\arg(z-z_0)\\le \\alpha$$\n    where $\\alpha$ is any real number such that $0<\\alpha<\\pi/2$. (Such\n    a region is known as a \u201cStoltz angle\u201d.)\n\n2.  Therefore, if $f$ converges at $z_0$, its sum defines a holomorphic\n    function on the region $\\Re(z)>\\Re(z_0)$, and moreover\n    $f(z)\\to f(z_0)$ as $z\\to z_0$ within any Stoltz angle.\n\n3.  $f=0$ identically if and only if all the coefficients $a_n$ are\n    zero.\n\nSo, if $f$ converges somewhere but not everywhere in ${\\mathbb{C}}$,\nthen the domain of its convergence is the region $\\Re(z)>\\rho$ for some\nreal number $\\rho$, which is called the *abscissa of convergence* of the\nDirichlet series. The abscissa of convergence of the series\n$f(z)=\\sum_n |a_n| e^{-\\lambda_nz}$, if it exists, is called the\n*abscissa of absolute convergence* of $f$.\n\nNow suppose that the coefficients $a_n$ are all real and nonnegative. If\nthe series $f$ converges for $\\Re(z)>\\rho$, and the resulting function\nadmits an to a neighbourhood of $\\rho$, then the series $f$ converges in\na neighbourhood of $\\rho$. Consequently, the domain of convergence of\n$f$ (unless it is the whole of ${\\mathbb{C}}$) is bounded by a\nsingularity at a point on the real axis.\n\nFinally, return to the general case of any complex numbers $(a_n)$, but\nsuppose $\\lambda_n=\\log n$, so $f$ is an ordinary Dirichlet series\n$\\sum\\frac{a_n}{n^z}$.\n\n1.  If the sequence $(a_n)$ is bounded, then $f$ converges absolutely in\n    the region $\\Re(z)>1$.\n\n2.  If the partial sums $\\sum_{n=k}^l a_n$ are bounded, then $f$\n    converges (not necessarily absolutely) in the region $\\Re(z)>0$.\n\n[1]{}\n\nSerre. , chapter\u00a0VI.
