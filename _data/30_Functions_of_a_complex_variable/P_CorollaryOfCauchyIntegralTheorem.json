  "statement": "**Theorem.** Let $\\gamma$ be a closed contour of $\\mathbb{C}$ not\nintersecting itself and $\\gamma_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\gamma_n$ likewise. Let all\nthe contours $\\gamma_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,\\gamma_n$ be outside each other but\ninsinde $\\gamma$. If the closed, \u201choley\u201d domain between $\\gamma$ and the\n$\\gamma_j$s is contained in a domain $U$ where $f$ is holomorphic, then\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\oint_\\gamma\\!f(z)\\,dz \\;=\\; \\oint_{\\gamma_1}\\!f(z)\\,dz+\\ldots+\\oint_{\\gamma_n}\\!f(z)\\,dz\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere all integrals are taken with the same direction of circulation.\nEspecially, in the case $n = 1$ one has $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\oint_\\gamma\\!f(z)\\,dz \\;=\\; \\oint_{\\gamma_1}\\!f(z)\\,dz.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n**Note 1.** The integrals in (1) and (2) need not necessarily vanish,\nsince inside a $\\gamma_j$ there may be points not belonging to $U$.\\\n**Note 2.** When $n = 0$, i.e. the sum on the right hand side of (1) is\n, it has the value 0; thus also the Cauchy integral theorem is a special\ncase of (1).\\\n**Note 3.** The theorem implies easily the residue theorem.\\\n*Proof.* We prove the theorem only in the case $n = 1$. Other cases may\nbe handled analogously.\\\nDraw two auxiliary ways connecting $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_1$. The integral\nof $f$ taken anticlockwise around the route consisting of the upper\nparts of the curves and the auxiliary ways is, by the fundamental\ntheorem of complex analysis, equal zero. Similarly the integral of $f$\ntaken anticlockwise around the route consisting of the lower parts of\nthe curves and the auxiliary ways is equal zero. Thus also the sum of\nboth equals zero. But in the sum, the portions taken along the auxiliary\nways are run in opposite directions and so they cancel each other.\nTherefore in the sum only the portions, which are run along $\\gamma$ and\n$\\gamma_1$, remain; then\n$$\\oint_\\gamma\\!f(z)\\,dz+\\oint_{\\gamma_1}\\!f(z)\\,dz \\;=\\; 0,$$ i.e.\n$$\\oint_\\gamma\\!f(z)\\,dz \\;=\\; -\\oint_{\\gamma_1}\\!f(z)\\,dz.$$ However,\nhere $\\gamma$ is run anticlockwise and $\\gamma_1$ clockwise. Reversing\nthe direction in the right hand side of this last equation, one obtains\n(2). Q.E.D.\n\n(-4.7,-4)(4.7,4) (0,0)(3.5,2) (0.5,0)[1]{} (-3.5,0)(-0.5,0)\n(1.5,0)(3.5,0) (-0.15,2.18)[$\\gamma$]{} (0.5,1.2)[$\\gamma_1$]{}\n\n**Example.** Calculate $$\\oint_C\\frac{dz}{z\\!-\\!z_0}$$ where the circle\n$C$ of complex plane with centre $z_0$ and radius $R$ is run once\nanticlockwise.\\\nSince $|z\\!-\\!z_0| = R$ we can take the parametric presentation\n$$z\\!-\\!z_0 \\;=\\; R e^{i\\varphi} \\quad \\mbox{with} \\quad 0 \\leqq \\varphi < 2\\pi.$$\nThen $dz \\;=\\; iR e^{i\\varphi}\\,d\\varphi$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\oint_C\\frac{dz}{z\\!-\\!z_0} \\;=\\; \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\!i\\,d\\varphi \\;=\\; 2i\\pi.\\end{aligned}$$\nBy the equation (2) of the theorem, one can infer that the result (3) is\ntrue for any continuous contour going once around the point $z_0$\nanticlockwise (cf. the lemma of ).",
