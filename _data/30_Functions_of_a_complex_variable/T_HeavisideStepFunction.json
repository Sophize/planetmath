  "definition": "The *Heaviside step function* is the function\n$H:{\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ defined as $$\\begin{aligned}\n H(x) &=& \\left\\{ \\begin {array}{ll} 0 & \\mbox{when}\\,\\, x< 0, \\\\\n 1/2 & \\mbox{when}\\,\\, x= 0,\\\\\n 1 & \\mbox{when}\\,\\, x> 0.\\\\\n \\end{array} \\right.\n \\end{aligned}$$ Here, there are many conventions for the value at\n$x=0$. The motivation for setting $H(0)=1/2$ is that we can then write\n$H$ as a function of the signum function (see ). In applications, such\nas the Laplace transform, where the Heaviside function is used\nextensively, the value of $H(0)$ is irrelevant. The Fourier transform of\nheaviside function is\n$$\\mathcal{F}_0 H(t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\delta(t)-\\frac{i}{\\pi t}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\delta$ denotes the Dirac delta centered at $0$. The function is\nnamed after Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925) [@heaviside_bib]. However, the\nfunction was already used by Cauchy[@cauchy_bib], who defined the\nfunction as $$u(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big( 1 + t/\\sqrt{t^2}\\big)$$ and called\nit a *coefficient limitateur* [@hoskins].\n\n[9]{} The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, .
