  "definition": "Let $K \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a compact subset of the complex plane,\nthen the [*polynomially convex hull*]{} of $K$, denoted $\\hat{K}$, is\ndefined as $$\\hat{K} :=\n\\{ z \\in {\\mathbb{C}} : \\lvert p(z) \\rvert \\leq \\max_{\\zeta \\in K} \\lvert p(\\zeta) \\rvert \\text{ for all polynomials $p$ } \\}.$$\nA compact set $K$ is said to be [*polynomially convex*]{} if\n$K = \\hat{K}$\n\nObviously $K \\subset \\hat{K}$. The intuitive idea behind this definition\nis that the polynomially convex hull of $K$ fills in any \u201choles\u201d that\nmay exist in $K$. The following proposition makes that precise.\n\nIf $K \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ is a polynomially convex set, then all the\ncomponents of the interior of $K$ are simply connected.\n\nOne of the reasons for this definition is the following result.\n\nLet $f$ be a function analytic in an open neighbourhood $N$ of a compact\nset $K \\subset\n{\\mathbb{C}}$, and suppose that $f$ can be approximated by polynomials\nuniformly on compact subsets of $N$. Then $f$ can be extended\nanalytically to a neighbourhood of $\\hat{K}$.\n\nFor example if we take\n$K = \\{ z \\in {\\mathbb{C}} : \\lvert z \\rvert = 1 \\}$ (the unit circle)\nthen $\\hat{K} = \\{ z \\in {\\mathbb{C}} : \\lvert z \\rvert \\leq 1 \\}$ (the\nclosed unit disc). The fact that the inside of the disc belongs to\n$\\hat{K}$ follows from the maximum modulus principle as polynomials are\nanalytic functions. The fact that $\\hat{K}$ does not contain anything\noutside the closed unit disc follows by looking at the polynomial\n$p(z) = z$ which has always greater modulus outside of the unit disc\nthen anywhere on the unit circle. So if we have a function defined on a\nneighbourhood of the unit circle and which we can approximate uniformly\non compact subsets of this neighbourhood by polynomials, then we can\nextend this function analytically to the whole unit disc. So this for\nexample implies that $f(z) := \\frac{1}{z}$ cannot be approximated\nuniformly on compact subsets by polynomials on a neighbourhood of the\nunit circle.\n\nThe reason why we call $\\hat{K}$ a \u201chull\u201d of some is that the\nconventional convex hull of $K \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ can be defined as\nthe set of points $x$ such that for all *linear functions*\n$f \\colon {\\mathbb{R}}^n\\to \\mathbb{R}$ we have\n$\\lvert f(x) \\rvert \\leq \\sup_{y\\in K} \\lvert f(y) \\rvert$. This\ncoincides with conventional definition because if $x$ is not in the\nconventional convex hull, then there is a linear functional that\nseparates $x$ from the hull (by Hahn-Banach theorem in general, or more\nelementarily in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ by Farkas\u2019s lemma), and conversely if\n$x$ is in the convex hull of $K$ then such linear function does not\nexist for the same reason. So, intuitively the conventional convex hull\nis set of point that are inseparable from from $K$ by linear functions.\nPolynomially convex hull is the same thing, but with polynomials. Of\ncourse similar definitions can be made with respect to other classes of\nfunctions. For example, hulls with respect to plurisubharmonic functions\nare very useful in multivariate complex analysis.\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B. Conway. [**]{}. Springer-Verlag, New York, New York, 1978.",
