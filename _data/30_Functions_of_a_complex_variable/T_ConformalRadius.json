  "definition": "Let $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a simply connected region that is not\nthe whole plane and let $a \\in G$ be any point. The Riemann mapping\ntheorem tells us that there exists a unique one-to-one and onto\nholomorphic map $f \\colon {\\mathbb{D}} \\to G$ (where ${\\mathbb{D}}$ is\nthe unit disc) such that $f(0) = a$ and $f'(0) > 0$. Then define the\n[*conformal radius*]{} $r(G,a) = f'(0)$.\n\nFor example, take $G = B(0,\\delta)$ (the open ball of radius $\\delta$\naround 0) for some $\\delta > 0$, then $r(G,0) = \\delta$ because we have\na map $f(z) = \\delta \\cdot z$ as our unique map. And thus this\ndefinition coincides with our definition of radius for this special\ncase.\n\nFor another example we look at how the conformal radius is affected by\nthe choice of the point $a$. So suppose that we take $G$ to be the unit\ndisc (${\\mathbb{D}}$) itself and we take some point\n$a \\in {\\mathbb{D}}$. The unique map that takes 0 to $a$ is the map\n$f(z) = \\frac{z+a}{1+\\bar{a}z}$ (where $\\bar{a}$ is the complex\nconjugate of $a$) and by the quotient rule we get that\n$f'(z) = \\frac{1-\\lvert a \\rvert^2}{(1+\\bar{a}z)^2}$. And so\n$r({\\mathbb{D}},a) = f'(0) = 1-\\lvert a \\rvert^2$, so the conformal\nradius of the unit disc goes to 0 as we move the point $a$ towards the\nboundary of the disc, and it is largest (equal to 1) when $a = 0$.\n\nFrom the first example we can now see another way of characterizing the\nconformal radius. Take the inverse map (inverses of holomorphic\none-to-one functions are also always holomorphic) and call it\n$\\varphi \\colon \nG \\to {\\mathbb{D}}$ (the map such that $\\varphi (f(z)) = z$). We take\nthe derivative (see the entry on ) we get\n$\\varphi'(f(0)) = \\frac{1}{f'(0)}$, that is $\\varphi'(a) = \\frac{1}{r}$\n(where we call $r = r(G,a)$ for brevity now). If we multiply the map by\nthe conformal radius we get a map $\\gamma\\colon G \\to B(0,r)$ such that\n$\\gamma (z) = r \\cdot \\varphi(z)$ and $\\gamma'(a) = 1$. By uniqueness of\nthe map arising from the Riemann mapping theorem we can see that\n$\\gamma$ is also unique. Thus we could define the conformal radius as\nfollows.\n\nLet $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a region and let $a \\in G$ be any point.\nBy application of Riemann mapping theorem there exists a unique map\n$\\gamma \\colon G \\to B(0,r)$ for some $r > 0$, such that $\\gamma(a) = 0$\nand $\\gamma'(a) = 1$. The [*conformal radius*]{} is then defined as\n$r(G,a) = r$.\n\nThis definition gives more of an intuitive understanding of why we\u2019d\ncall this the conformal radius of $G$. We look at the unique map with\n$\\gamma'(a) = 1$, that is, the map that doesn\u2019t \u201cstretch\u201d the set. So\nthe radius of $G$ with respect to $a$ is really the radius of the unique\nball around zero to which $G$ is conformally equivalent without any\n\u201cstretching\u201d needed.\n\n[9]{} S. Rohde, M.
