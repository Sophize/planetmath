  "statement": "Let $U\\subset{\\mathbb{C}}$ be an open, simply connected domain, and let\n$f:U\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a function whose complex derivative,\nthat is $$\\lim_{w\\rightarrow z} \\frac{f(w)-f(z)}{w-z},$$ exists for all\n$z\\in U$. Then, the around every closed contour $\\gamma\\subset U$\nvanishes; in symbols $$\\oint_\\gamma f(z)\\, dz = 0.$$\n\nWe also have the following, technically important generalization\ninvolving removable singularities.\n\nLet $U\\subset{\\mathbb{C}}$ be an open, simply connected domain, and\n$S\\subset U$ a finite subset. Let $f:U\\backslash S \\rightarrow\n  {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a function whose complex derivative exists for all\n$z\\in\n  U\\backslash S$, and that is bounded near all $z\\in S$. Let\n$\\gamma\\subset    \n   U\\backslash S$ be a closed contour that avoids the exceptional\npoints. Then, the integral of $f$ around $\\gamma$ vanishes.\n\nCauchy\u2019s theorem is an essential stepping stone in the theory of complex\nanalysis. It is required for the proof of the Cauchy integral formula,\nwhich in turn is required for the proof that the existence of a complex\nderivative implies a power series representation.\n\nThe original version of the theorem, as stated by Cauchy in the early\n1800s, requires that the derivative $f'(z)$ exist and be continuous. The\nexistence of $f'(z)$ implies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which in turn\ncan be restated as the fact that the complex-valued differential\n$f(z)\\, dz$ is closed. The original proof makes use of this fact, and\ncalls on Green\u2019s Theorem to conclude that the contour integral vanishes.\nThe proof of Green\u2019s theorem, however, involves an interchange of order\nin a double integral, and this can only be justified if the integrand,\nwhich involves the real and imaginary parts of $f'(z)$, is assumed to be\ncontinuous. To this date, many authors prove the theorem this way, but\nerroneously fail to mention the continuity assumption.\n\nIn the latter part of the $19{^{\\text{th}}}$ century E. Goursat found a\nproof of the integral theorem that merely required that $f'(z)$ exist.\nContinuity of the derivative, as well as the existence of all higher\nderivatives, then follows as a consequence of the Cauchy integral\nformula. Not only is Goursat\u2019s version a sharper result, but it is also\nmore elementary and self-contained, in that sense that it is does not\nrequire Green\u2019s theorem. Goursat\u2019s argument makes use of rectangular\ncontour (many authors use triangles though), but the extension to an\narbitrary simply-connected domain is relatively straight-forward.\n\nLet $U$ be an open domain containing a rectangle\n$$R = \\{ x+iy\\in{\\mathbb{C}}: a\\leq x\\leq b\\,, c\\leq y\\leq d\\}.$$ If the\ncomplex derivative of a function $f:U\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{C}}$ exists at\nall points of $U$, then the contour integral of $f$ around the boundary\nof $R$ vanishes; in symbols $$\\oint_{\\partial R} f(z)\\,dz = 0.$$\n\n#### Bibliography.\n\n-   Ahlfors, L., Complex Analysis.
