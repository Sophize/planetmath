  "statement": "Let $f$ be an analytic function defined in a disk of radius $R$ about a\npoint $z_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Then the radius of convergence of the Taylor\nseries of $f$ about $z_0$ is at least $R$.\n\nFor example, the function $a(z) = 1 / (1 - z)^2$ is analytic inside the\ndisk $|z| < 1$. Hence its the radius of covergence of its Taylor series\nabout $0$ is at least $1$. By direct examination of the Taylor series we\ncan see that its radius of convergence is, in fact, equal to $1$.\n\nColloquially, this theorem is stated in the sometimes imprecise but\nmemorable form \u201cThe radius of convergence of the Taylor series is the\ndistance to the nearest singularity.\u201d",
