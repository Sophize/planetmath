  "argumentText": "Assume that $a$ is an essential singularity of $f$. Let $V\\subset U$ be\na punctured neighborhood of $a$, and let $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$. We have\nto show that $\\lambda$ is a limit point of $f(V)$. Suppose it is not,\nthen there is an $\\epsilon>0$ such that $|f(z)-\\lambda|>\\epsilon$ for\nall $z\\in V$, and the function\n$$g:V\\to\\mathbb{C}, z\\mapsto\\frac{1}{f(z)-\\lambda}$$ is bounded, since\n$|g(z)|=\\frac{1}{|f(z)-\\lambda|}<\\epsilon^{-1}$ for all $z\\in V$.\nAccording to Riemann\u2019s removable singularity theorem, this implies that\n$a$ is a removable singularity of $g$, so that $g$ can be extended to a\nholomorphic function $\\bar\ng:V\\cup\\{a\\}\\to\\mathbb C$. Now $$f(z)=\\frac{1}{\\bar g(z)}-\\lambda$$ for\n$z\\neq a$, and $a$ is either a removable singularity of $f$ (if\n$\\bar g(z)\\neq 0$) or a pole of order $n$ (if $\\bar g$ has a zero of\norder $n$ at $a$). This contradicts our assumption that $a$ is an\nessential singularity, which means that $\\lambda$ must be a limit point\nof $f(V)$. The argument holds for all $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$, so $f(V)$\nis dense in $\\mathbb{C}$ for any punctured neighborhood $V$ of $a$.\n\nTo prove the converse, assume that $f(V)$ is dense in $\\mathbb{C}$ for\nany punctured neighborhood $V$ of $a$. If $a$ is a removable\nsingularity, then $f$ is bounded near $a$, and if $a$ is a pole,\n$f(z)\\to\\infty$ as $z\\to a$. Either of these possibilities contradicts\nthe assumption that the image of any punctured neighborhood of $a$ under\n$f$ is dense in $\\mathbb C$, so $a$ must be an essential singularity of\n$f$.",
