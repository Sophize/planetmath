  "definition": "An *entire function* is a function\n$f: \\mathbb{C} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ which is holomorphic\neverywhere on the complex domain $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nFor example, a polynomial is holomorphic everywhere, as is the\nexponential function. The function $z\\mapsto 1/z$ is not holomorphic at\nzero, so it is not entire; it is meromorphic.",
