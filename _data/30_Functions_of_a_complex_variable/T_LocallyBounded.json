  "definition": "Suppose that $X$ is a topological space and $Y$ a metric space.\n\nA set ${\\mathcal{F}}$ of functions $f\\colon X \\to Y$ is said to be\n[*locally bounded*]{} if for every $x \\in X$, there exists a\nneighbourhood $N$ of $x$ such that ${\\mathcal{F}}$ is uniformly bounded\non $N$.\n\nIn the special case of functions on the complex plane where it is often\nused, the definition can be given as follows.\n\nA set ${\\mathcal{F}}$ of functions\n$f\\colon G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}} \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$ is said to be\n[*locally bounded*]{} if for every $a \\in G$ there exist constants\n$\\delta > 0$ and $M > 0$ such that for all $z \\in G$ such that\n$\\lvert z-a \\rvert < \\delta$, $\\lvert f(z) \\rvert < M$ for all\n$f \\in {\\mathcal{F}}$.\n\nAs an example we can look at the set ${\\mathcal{F}}$ of entire functions\nwhere $f(z) = z^2 + t$ for any $t \\in [0,1]$. Obviously each such $f$ is\nunbounded itself, however if we take a small neighbourhood around any\npoint we can bound all $f \\in {\\mathcal{F}}$. Say on an open ball\n$B(z_0,1)$ we can show by triangle inequality that\n$\\lvert f(z) \\rvert \\leq (\\lvert z_0 \\rvert +1)^2 + 1$ for all\n$z \\in B(z_0,1)$. So this set of functions is locally bounded.\n\nAnother example would be say the set of all analytic functions from some\nregion $G$ to the unit disc. All those functions are bounded by 1, and\nso we have a uniform bound even over all of $G$.\n\nAs a counterexample suppose the we take the constant functions\n$f_n(z) = n$ for all natural numbers $n$. While each of these functions\nis itself bounded, we can never find a uniform bound for all such\nfunctions.\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B. Conway. [**]{}. Springer-Verlag, New York, New York, 1978.",
