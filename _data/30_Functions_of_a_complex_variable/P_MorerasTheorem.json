If for every closed\ntriangle $\\Delta$ in $G$, we have $$\\int_{\\partial \\Delta} f\\, dz = 0,$$\nthen $f$ is analytic on $G$. (Here, $\\partial \\Delta$ is the piecewise\nlinear of $\\Delta$.)\n\nIn particular, if for every rectifiable closed curve $\\Gamma$ in $G$, we\nhave $\\int_{\\Gamma} f\\, dz = 0,$ then $f$ is analytic on $G$. Proofs of\nthis can be found most undergraduate books on complex analysis\n[@kreyszig93; @silverman].\n\n[9]{} W. Rudin, *Real and complex analysis*, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill Inc.,\n1987. E.
