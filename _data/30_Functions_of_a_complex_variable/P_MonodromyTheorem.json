  "statement": "Let $C(t)$ be a one-parameter family of smooth paths in the complex\nplane with common endpoints $z_0$ and $z_1$. (For definiteness, one may\nsuppose that the parameter $t$ takes values in the interval $[0,1]$.)\nSuppose that an analytic function $f$ is defined in a neighborhood of\n$z_0$ and that it is possible to analytically continue $f$ along every\npath in the family. Then the result of analytic continuation does not\ndepend on the choice of path.\n\nNote that it is *crucial* that it be possible to continue $f$ along all\npaths of the family. As the following example shows, the result will no\nlonger hold if it is impossible to analytically continue $f$ along even\na single path. Let the family of paths be the set of circular arcs (for\nthe present purpose, the straight line is to be considered as a\ndegenerate case of a circular arc) with endpoints $+1$ and $-1$ and let\n$f(z) = \\sqrt{z}$. It is possible to analytically continue $f$ along\nevery arc in the family except the line segment passing through $0$. The\nconclusion of the theorem does not hold in this case because continuing\nalong arcs which lie above $0$ leads to $f(z_1) = +i$ whilst continuing\nalong arcs which lie below $0$ leads to $f(z_1) = -i$.",
