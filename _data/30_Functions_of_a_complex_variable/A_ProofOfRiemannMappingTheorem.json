  "argumentText": "This proof relies on the existence of a solution to the Dirichlet\nproblem, and hence is applicable to any domain for which it can be\nproven that the Dirichlet problem has a solution. For simplicity, I will\nassume that the region $U$ is bounded; Since this proof uses real\ntechniques to prove a complex result, a few simple conventions will make\nit easier to read. The letter $x$ and $y$ will always denote real\nquantities and $z$ will always equal $x + i y$. Functions of a complex\nvariable will be written as functions of two real variables without\nfurther warning; thus, $f(z)$ and $f(x,y)$ will denote the same entity.\n\nConsider the following boundary value problem:\n$${\\partial^2 u \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 u \\over \\partial y^2} = 0$$\n$$u(x,y) = \\log |x + i y - a|$$ when $x + iy$ lies on the boundary of\n$U$. Note that, since $a$ lies in the interior of $U$,\n$\\log |x + i y - a|$ bounded on the boundary of $U$. Hence, by the\nexistence theorem, there exists a unique function $u$ satisfying this\nboundary value problem. Since the boundary values of $u$ are bounded,\n$u$ will be bounded on the interior of $U$ as well. By the regularity\ntheorem for the Laplace equation, $h$ will be differentiable (in fact,\nanalytic) on the interior of $U$.\n\nBecause $u$ satisfies the two-dimensional Laplace equation, the curl of\nthe vector field\n$$\\left( -{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}, {\\partial u \\over \\partial x} \\right)$$\nvanishes. Since $U$ is simply connected, Poincare\u2019s lemma implies that\nthere must exist a function $v$ such that this vector field is the\ngradient of $v$. Since $v$ is only determind up to an additive constant,\nwe may impose the condition $v(a) = 0$. Written out explicitly, the\ncondition that the gradient of $v$ equals the vector field looks like\n$${\\partial v \\over \\partial x} = -{\\partial u \\over \\partial y}$$\n$${\\partial v \\over \\partial x} = {\\partial u \\over \\partial x}$$ Note\nthat these equations are exactly the Cauchy-Riemann equations for $u$\nand $v$ and, hence, $u + i v$ is an analytic function.\n\nDefine $p$ $q$, and $f$ as $$p(z) = u(z) - \\log |z - a|$$\n$$q(z) = v(z) - \\arg |z - a|$$\n$$f(z) = \\exp (-p(z) - iq(z)) = (z-a) \\exp (- u(z) - iv(z) )$$ Because\n$u$ and $v$ satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation, $p$ and $q$ will also satisfy\nLaplace\u2019s equation in $U \\setminus \\{a\\}$. Note that, whilst $p$ is\nsingle-valued, $q$ is multiply-valued with branch point at $a$. Upon\ncircling $a$ once, the value of $q$ increases by $2 \\pi i$. On the other\nhand, $f$ is single valued since the exponentiation operation cancels\nout the multiple-valuedness of $q$. Because $p$ and $q$ satisfy the\nCauchy-Riemann equations and the exponential function is analytic, $f$\nis analytic.\n\nBy construction, $p(z) = 0$ when $z$ lies on the boundary of $U$. It\nwill now be shown that $p(z) \\ge 0$ whenever $z \\in U \\setminus \\{a\\}$.\nSince $\\log |z - a| \\to - \\infty$ as $z \\to a$ and $h(a)$ is finite, it\nfollows that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$, such that $p(z) > 0$ when\n$0 < |z - a| \\le \\epsilon$ Consider the region\n$V = \\{z \\in U \\colon |z| > \\epsilon\\}$. For a point $z$ to lie on the\nboundary of $V$, either $|z - a| = \\epsilon$ or $z$ must lie on the\nboundary of $U$. Either way, $p(z) \\ge 0$, so the maximum principle\nimplies that $p(z) \\ge 0$ whenever $z \\in V$. We already saw that\n$p(z) \\ge 0$ when $0 < |z| < \\epsilon$, so $p(z) > 0$ whenever\n$z \\in U \\setminus \\{a\\}$.\n\nAs a consequence, $|f(z)| \\le 1$ when $z \\in U$ because\n$$|f(z)| = \\exp \\left( -p(z) \\right) \\le 1$$ Also, note that $f(a) = 0$\nand that $f'(a)$ is real and positive because\n$$f'(a) = \\exp \\left( -u(a) + i v(a) \\right) = \\exp \\left( -u(a) \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nsince $v$ was chosen so that $v(a) = 0$.\n\nTo show that $f$ is bijective, we shall study the level sets of $p$. To\nsimplify this study, we shall exclude those points at which the\nderivative of $f$ vanishes. For every real number $r > 0$, define\n$$A(r) = \\{ z \\in U \\colon |f(z)| \\ge e^{-r} \\quad \\& \\quad f'(z) = 0 \\}$$\nWe will now show that $A(r)$ is finite. The set\n$$\\{ z \\in U \\colon |f(z)| \\ge e^{-r} \\}$$ is compact. Hence, were\n$A(r)$ infinite, it would have an accumulation point. Since $f(z) = 0$\nwhenever $s \\in A(r)$ and $f$ is analytic, this would imply that\n$f(z) = 0$ identically, which is not the case. Hence, $A(r)$ must be\nfinite.\n\nChoose $r$ such that $f'(z) \\ne 0$ whenever $|z| = r$. Let $C(r)$ denote\nthe level set $$C(r) = \\{ z \\colon p(z) = r \\}$$ We shall now show that\n$C$ is smooth and is homeomorphic to a circle. As the level set of a\ncontinuous function on a compact set, $C$ is compact. Let $w$ be an\npoint of $C(r)$. By assumption, $f'(w) \\ne 0$. Hence, by the inverse\nfunction theorem, there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $w$ on which $f$ is\ninvertible. Furthermore, $f^{-1}$ is an anlytic function. Since\n$z \\in C(r)$ if and only if $|f(z)| = e^{-r}$, it follows that\n$C(r) \\cap N$ is the image of an arc the circle\n$\\{ z \\colon |z| = e^{-r} \\}$ under $f^{-1}$. Hence, $C(r) \\cap N$ is\ndiffeomorphic to a line segment.\n\nSince this is true of every point $w \\in C(r)$, $C(r)$ is a compact\none-dimensional manifold. A compact, one-dimensional manifold must be\neither a circle or a finite union of circles. Suppose that $C$ is a\nunion of more than one circle. By the Jordan curve theorem, each of\nthese circles divides the compex plane into an interior and an exterior\nreigion. Hence, given two of the circles which would comprise $C(r)$,\none of these circles would have to lie inside the other and there would\nhave to be an open set which has these two circles as boundary. However,\nit is assumed that $p$ is constant on both circles and assumes the same\nvalue on both. By the maximum principle, this would imply that $p$ is\nconstant in the region between the circles which would, in turn, imply\nthat $f$ is constant on $U$, which is impossible. Hence, $C$ consists of\na single circle.\n\nNext, note that $a$ must lie inside $C$. If $a$ did not lie in $C$, it\nwould follow that $|f(z)|<r$ when $z$ lies outside of $C$. But this is\nnot possible because the boundary of $u$ lies on the outsde of $C$ as\nwell and $|f|$ was chosen to satisfy the boundary value $|f(z)| = 1$\nwhen $z$ lies on the boundary of $U$.\n\nSince $a$ lies on the interior of the circle $C$, the winding number of\n$C$ about $a$ is 1. Hence, upon traversing $C$ once, the phase of $q$\nwill increase by $2 \\pi$.\n\nSince $f^{-1}$ is analytic, $C$ is not only homeomorphic to a circle, it\nis also a smooth curve. Hence it makes sense to speak of the tangent to\n$C$ and the normal to $C$. In terms of the normal and tangential\nderivatives, the Cauchy-Riemann equations my be written as\n$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial n},\\quad\n \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial n} = -\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}$$ Since\n$p(x) = r$ when $x$ lies on $C(r)$ and $p(x) \\ge r$ when $x$ lies in the\ninterior of $C(r)$, it follows that $\\partial p / \\partial t = 0$ and\n$\\partial p / \\partial n > 0$. By the Cauchy-Riemann eqations, this\nmeans that $\\partial q / \\partial t \\le 0$. It is not possible that\n$\\partial q / \\partial t \\le 0$ because, if that were so, then all the\nderivatives of $p$ and $q$ would vanish, which would imply that\n$f' = 0$, contrary to hypothesis. Hence $q$ is a monotonically\ndecreasing function on $C(r)$. We already saw that $q$ decreases by\n$2 \\pi$ upon traversing $C(r)$. These two facts together imply that\n$\\exp(-iq)$ is a bijection from $C(r)$ to the unit circle. Hence $f$ is\na bijection from $C(r)$ to the circle of radius $e^{-r}$.\n\nTo finish the proof, we need to deal with the points $z$ such that\n$f'(z) = 0$. We shall use the argument principle to show that these\npoints do not exist! As before, choose $r$ such that $f'(z) \\ne 0$\nwhenever $|z| = r$. Then $C(r)$ is a smooth close curve and we may apply\nthe argument principle to $f'$ along $C(r)$. Differentiating the\ndefinition, $$f'(z) = -f(z) (u'(z) + i v'(z))$$ Since the argument of a\nproduct is the sum of the arguments of the factors, we may consider $f$\nand $u' + iv'$ separately. The argument principle states that, because\n$f$ has only one simple zero (located at $a$) inside $C(r)$, the\nargument of $f$ will increase by $2 \\pi$ upon traversing $C(r)$. To\ncompute the argument of $u' + iv'$, we may make use of the fact that the\nderivative of an analytic function is the same no matter what direction\none chooses to compute the derivative. To compute the derivative of\n$u + i v$ at a point on $C(r)$, choose the normal direction. From what\nwe had seen earlier, it follows that $u' + iv'$ will point along the\ninward normal to $C(r)$. Since the inward normal rotates by by $-2 \\pi$\nupon traversing the curve, the argument of $u' + iv'$ changes by\n$-2 \\pi$ upon traversing $C(r)$. Hence, the argument of $f'$ stays the\nsame after traversing $C(r)$. Since $f'$ is analytic inside $C(r)$, the\nargument principle states that $f'$ can have no zeros inside of $C(r)$.",
