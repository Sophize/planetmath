  "argumentText": "We provide a proof of Morera\u2019s theorem under the hypothesis that\n$\\int_\\Gamma f(z)dz=0$ for any circuit $\\Gamma$ contained in $G$. This\nis apparently more restrictive, but actually equivalent, to supposing\n$\\int_{\\partial\\Delta} f(z)dz=0$ for any triangle $\\Delta\\subseteq G$,\nprovided that $f$ is continuous in $G$.\n\nThe idea is to prove that $f$ has an antiderivative $F$ in $G$. Then\n$F$, being holomorphic in $G$, will have derivatives of any order in\n$G$; but $F^{(n)}(z)=f^{(n-1)}(z)$ for all $z\\in G$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\n$n\\geq 1$.\n\nFirst, suppose $G$ is connected. Then $G$, being open, is also pathwise\nconnected.\n\nFix $z_0\\in G$. For any $z\\in G$ define $F(z)$ as $$\\label{eq:antid}\nF(z) = \\int_{\\gamma(z_0,z)}f(w)dw\\;,$$ where $\\gamma(z_0,z)$ is a path\nentirely contained in $G$ with initial point $z_0$ and final point $z$.\n\nThe function $F:G\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is well defined. In fact, let $\\gamma_1$\nand $\\gamma_2$ be any two paths entirely contained in $G$ with initial\npoint $z_0$ and final point $z$; define a circuit $\\Gamma$ by joining\n$\\gamma_1$ and $-\\gamma_2$, the path obtained from $\\gamma_2$ by\n\u201creversing the parameter direction\u201d. Then by linearity and additivity of\nintegral $$\\label{eq:wd}\n\\int_\\Gamma f(w)dw\n=\\int_{\\gamma_1}f(w)dw+\\int_{-\\gamma_2}f(w)dw\n=\\int_{\\gamma_1}f(w)dw-\\int_{\\gamma_2}f(w)dw\\;;$$ but the left-hand side\nis 0 by hypothesis, thus the two integrals on the right-hand side are\nequal.\n\nWe must now prove that $F'=f$ in $G$. Given $z\\in G$, there exists $r>0$\nsuch that the ball $B_r(z)$ of radius $r$ centered in $z$ is contained\nin $G$. Suppose $0<|\\Delta{z}|<r$: then we can choose as a path from $z$\nto $z+\\Delta{z}$ the segment $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to G$ parameterized by\n$t\\mapsto z+t\\Delta{z}$. Write $f=u+iv$ with $u,v:G\\to\\mathbb{R}$: by\nadditivity of integral and the mean value theorem, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{F(z+\\Delta{z})-F(z)}{\\Delta{z}}\n& = & \\frac{1}{\\Delta{z}}\\int_{\\gamma}f(w)dw \\\\\n& = & \\frac{1}{\\Delta{z}}\\int_0^1f(z+t\\Delta{z})\\Delta{z}dt \\\\\n& = & u(z+\\theta_u\\Delta{z})+iv(z+\\theta_v\\Delta{z})\\end{aligned}$$ for\nsome $\\theta_u,\\theta_v\\in(0,1)$. Since $f$ is continuous, so are $u$\nand $v$, and\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta{z}\\to 0} \\frac{F(z+\\Delta{z})-F(z)}{\\Delta{z}}\n= u(z) + iv(z) = f(z) \\,.$$ In the general case, we just repeat the\nprocedure once for each connected component of $G$.",
