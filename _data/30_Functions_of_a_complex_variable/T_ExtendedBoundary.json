The [*extended boundary*]{} of $G$ denoted\n$\\partial_\\infty G$ is defined as the boundary of $G$ plus the point at\ninfinity if in fact $G$ is unbounded.\n\nThe extended boundary of $G$ is really the boundary of $G$ in the\nextended complex plane (the one-point compactification of\n${\\mathbb{C}}$).\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B.
