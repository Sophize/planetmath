  "definition": "A mapping $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ which preserves the\nmagnitude and orientation of the angles between any two curves which\nintersect in a given point $z_0$ is said to be conformal at $z_0$. A\nmapping that is conformal at any point in a domain $D$ is said to be\nconformal in $D$.\n\nAn important special case is when $m = n = 2$. In this case, we may\nidentify $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\\mathbb{C}$ and speak of conformal\nmappings of the complex plane. It can be shown that a mapping\n$f \\colon \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is conformal if and only if $f$ is\na complex analytic function. The complex conjugate $\\overline{f}$ of a\nconformal mapping $f$ is [*inversely conformal*]{}, i.e. it preserves\nthe magnitude but reverses the orientation of angles.\n\nIf $m = n$, then we can study invertible conformal mappings. It is clear\nfrom the definition that the composition of two such maps and the\ninverse of any such map is again an invertible conformal mapping, so the\nset of such mappings forms a group. In the case $m = n > 2$, the group\nof conformal mappings is finite dimensional and is generated by\nrotations, translations, and spherical inversions.\n\nThis notion of conformal mappings can be generalized to any setting in\nwhich it makes sense to speak of angles between curves or angles between\ntangent vectors. In particular, one can consider conformal mappings of\nRiemannian manifolds. It can be shown that, if $(M,g)$ and $(N,h)$ are\nRiemannian manifolds, then a map $f \\colon M \\to N$ is conformal if and\nonly if $f^* h = s g$ for some scalar field $s$ (on $M$).",
