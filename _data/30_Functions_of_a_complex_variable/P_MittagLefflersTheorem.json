For each $k$,\nlet $A_{1k},\\dots,A_{m_kk}$ be arbitrary complex coefficients, and\ndefine $$S_k(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m_k} \\frac{A_{jk}}{(z-a_k)^j}.$$ Then\nthere exists a meromorphic function $f$ on $G$ whose poles are exactly\nthe points $\\{a_k\\}$ and such that the singular part of $f$ at $a_k$ is\n$S_k(z)$, for each $k$.",
