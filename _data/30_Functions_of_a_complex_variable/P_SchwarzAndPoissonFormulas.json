While solving the\ntwo-dimensional problem for special of boundaries is likely to present\nserious computational difficulties, it is possible to write down\nformulas for a boundary. We shall give Schwarz and Poisson formulas that\nsolve the Dirichlet problem for a circular domain.\n\nSchwarz formula {#schwarz-formula .unnumbered}\n===============\n\nWithout loss of generality, we shall consider the compact disc\n$\\overline{D}:|z|\\leq 1$ in the $z-$plane, its boundary will be denoted\nby $\\gamma$ and any point on this one by $\\zeta=e^{i\\theta}$. Let it be\nrequired to determine a harmonic function $u(x,y)$, which on the\nboundary $\\gamma$ assumes the values $$\\begin{aligned}\nu\\big\\vert_\\gamma=f(\\theta),\\end{aligned}$$ where $f(\\theta)$ is a\ncontinuous single-valued function of $\\theta$. Let $v(x,y)$ be the\nconjugate harmonic function which is determined to within an arbitrary\nconstant from the knowledge of the function $u$. [[^1]]{}Then the\nfunction $$\\begin{aligned}\nw(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)\\end{aligned}$$ is an analytic function for all\nvalues of $z\\in D$. We shall suppose that $w(z)\\in C(\\overline{D})$ the\nclass of continuous functions. Therefore, we may write the boundary\ncondition (1) as $$\\begin{aligned}\nw(\\zeta)+\\overline{w}(\\overline{\\zeta})=2f(\\theta) \\quad on \\,\\, \\gamma.\\end{aligned}$$\nWe define here $\\overline{w}(\\zeta)=\\overline{w(\\overline{\\zeta})}$ and\n$\\overline{w}(\\overline{\\zeta})=\\overline{w(\\zeta)}$. Next, we multiply\n(2) by $\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta-z}$ and, by integrating over\n$\\gamma$, we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{w(\\zeta)}{\\zeta-z}d\\zeta+\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{\\overline{w}(\\overline{\\zeta})}{\\zeta-z}d\\zeta\n=\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta-z}d\\zeta\\:,\\end{aligned}$$\nwhich, by Harnack\u2019s theorem, is to (2). Notice that the first integral\non the left is equal to $w(z)$ by Cauchy\u2019s integral formula, and for the\nsame reason [[^2]]{} the second one is equal to $\\overline{w}(0)$. Let\n$\\overline{w}(0)=a-ib$, thus (3) becomes $$\\begin{aligned}\nw(z)=\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta-z}d\\zeta-a+ib.\\end{aligned}$$\nBy setting $z=0$ in (4), we get $$\\begin{aligned}\na+ib=\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta}d\\zeta-a+ib,\\end{aligned}$$\nwhence $$\\begin{aligned}\n2a=\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta}d\\zeta=\n\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_0^{2\\pi} f(\\theta)d\\theta.\\end{aligned}$$ As one\nwould expect, $b$ is left undetermined because the conjugate harmonic\nfunction $v(x,y)$ is determined to within an arbitrary real constant.\nFinally we substitute $a$ from (5) in (4), $$\\begin{aligned}\nw(z)=\\frac{1}{\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta-z}d\\zeta-\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{f(\\theta)}{\\zeta}d\\zeta+ib=\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma f(\\theta)\\frac{\\zeta+z}{\\zeta-z}\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta}\n+ib,\\end{aligned}$$ the aimed Schwarz formula.[[^3]]{}\n\nPoisson formula {#poisson-formula .unnumbered}\n===============\n\nIf we substitute $z=\\rho\\: e^{i\\phi}$ and $\\zeta=e^{i\\theta}$ in (6) and\nseparate the real and imaginary parts, we find $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Re{w(z)}\\equiv u(\\rho,\\phi)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\!\\!\n\\frac{(1-\\rho^2)f(\\theta)}{1-2\\rho\\cos{(\\theta-\\phi)}+\\rho^2}\\;d\\theta\\:.\\end{aligned}$$\nThis is the Poisson formula (so-called also Poisson integral), which\ngives the solution of Dirichlet problem. It is possible to prove that\n(7) also the solution under the assumption that $f(\\theta)$ is a\npiecewise continuous function.[[^4]]{} It is also possible to generalize\nthe formulas obtained above so as to make them apply to any simply\nconnected region. This is done by introducing a mapping function and the\nidea of conformal mapping of simply connected domains.[[^5]]{}\n\n[99]{} O. D. Kellog, [*Foundations of Potential Theory*]{}, Dover, 1954.\nG. C. Evans, [*The Logarithmic Potential*]{}, Chap. IV, New York, 1927.\n\n[^1]: Since $u+iv$ is an analytic function of $z=x+iy$,it is clear from\n    the Cauchy-Riemann equations that the function $v(x,y)$ is\n    determined by $$\\begin{aligned}\n    v(x,y)=\\int_{z_0}^z\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}dx+\n    \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}dy=\\int_{z_0}^z -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}dx+\n    \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}dy\\:,\\end{aligned}$$ where the integral\n    is evaluated over an arbitrary path joining some point $z_0$ with an\n    arbitrary point $z$ belonging to the unitary open disc $D$. We are\n    concerned to a simply connected domain, so that the function\n    $v(x,y)$ will be single-valued.\n\n[^2]: From Taylor\u2019s formula $$\\begin{aligned}\n    w(z)=w(0)+w'(0)z+\\frac{1}{2!}w''(0)z^2+O(z^3).\\end{aligned}$$ But on\n    $\\gamma$, $\\overline{z}=1/\\zeta$, so $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\overline{w}(\\overline{\\zeta})=\\overline{w}(0)+\\overline{w}'(0)\\frac{1}{\\zeta}+\n    \\frac{1}{2!}\\overline{w}''(0)\\frac{1}{\\zeta^2}+O\\bigg(\\frac{1}{\\zeta^3}\\bigg)\\end{aligned}$$\n    and term-by-term integration gives the desired result recalling that\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_\\gamma\\frac{d\\zeta}{\\zeta^n(\\zeta-z)}=\n    \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n    1, & if \\;\\; n=0, \\\\\n    0, & otherwise.\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n[^3]: It is possible to prove that, if $f(\\theta)$ satisfies H\u00f6lder\n    condition, then the function $w(z)$ given by (6) will be continuous\n    in $\\overline{D}$. Such a condition is less restrictive than the\n    requirement of the existence of a bounded derivative.\n\n[^4]: See [@cite:Kellog].\n\n[^5]: For a discussion of Neumann problem, see [@cite:Evans].",
