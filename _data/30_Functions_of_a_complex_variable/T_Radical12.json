  "definition": "The $\\sqrt{\\hspace{3mm}}$ is called a *radical*. The of the radical\nsymbol is the first letter \u201c[*r*]{}\u201d of the Latin , which \u201c\u201d.\n\nThere is other terminology that is related to radicals: In the\nexpression $\\sqrt[3]{x}$, $x$ is the *radicand* and $3$ is the *index*.\n\nThe index of a radical is usually an integer at least as large as two;\nhowever, if the index is two, it is usually not written. Moreover, if a\nradical does not have a written index, it is understood to be two, in\nwhich case the radical denotes a square root.\n\nA *radical expression* is an expression that involves a radical.\n\nOne can use fractional powers instead of the radical symbol via\n$\\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{\\frac{1}{n}}$. This practice of avoiding the radical\nsymbol may be due to typesetting issues.",
