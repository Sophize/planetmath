Then\n$$\\int_C f(z)\\ dz = 0$$ for any smooth closed curve $C$ in $U$.\n\nMore generally, if $U$ is any domain, and $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two\nhomotopic smooth closed curves in $U$, then\n$$\\int_{C_1} f(z)\\ dz = \\int_{C_2} f(z)\\ dz.$$ for any holomorphic\nfunction $f: U \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$.",
