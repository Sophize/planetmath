  "statement": "For a region $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ define\n$G^* := \\{ z : \\bar{z} \\in G \\}$ (where $\\bar{z}$ is the complex\nconjugate of $z$). If $G$ is a [*symmetric region*]{}, that is\n$G = G^*$, then we define\n$G_+ := \\{ z \\in G : \\operatorname{Im} z > 0 \\}$,\n$G_- := \\{ z \\in G : \\operatorname{Im} z < 0 \\}$ and\n$G_0 := \\{ z \\in G : \\operatorname{Im} z = 0 \\}$.\n\nLet $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a region such that $G = G^*$ and suppose\nthat $f \\colon G_+ \\cup G_0 \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$ is a continuous functions\nthat is analytic on $G_+$ and further that $f(x)$ is real for\n$x \\in G_0$ (that is for real $x$), then there is an analytic function\n$g : G \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$ such that $g(z) = f(z)$ for\n$z \\in G_+ \\cup G_0$.\n\nThat is you can \u201creflect\u201d an analytic function across the real axis.\nNote that by composing with various conformal mappings you could\ngeneralize the above to reflection across an analytic curve. So loosely\nstated, the theorem says that if an analytic function is defined in a\nregion with some \u201cnice\u201d boundary and the function behaves \u201cnice\u201d on this\nboundary, then we can extend the function to a larger domain. Let us\nmake this statement precise with the following generalization.\n\nLet $G, \\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be regions and let $\\gamma$ and\n$\\omega$ be free analytic boundary arcs in $\\partial G$ and\n$\\partial \\Omega$. Suppose that\n$f \\colon G \\cup \\gamma \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$ is a continuous function that\nis analytic on $G$, $f(G) \\subset \\Omega$ and\n$f(\\gamma) \\subset \\omega$, then for any compact set\n$\\kappa \\subset \\gamma$, $f$ has an analytic continuation to an open set\ncontaining $G \\cup \\kappa$.\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B.
