Furthermore, both\n$f_1$ and $f_2$ are analytic inside this disk. Since $z_0$ is a limit\npoint, there must exist a sequence ${x_k}_{k=1}^\\infty$ of distinct\npoints of $s$ which converges to $z_0$. We may further assume that\n$|x_k - z_0| < \\epsilon_0$ for every $k$.\n\nBy the theorem on the radius of convergence of a complex function, the\nTaylor series of $f_1$ and $f_2$ about $z_0$ have radii of convergence\ngreater than or equal to $\\epsilon_0$. Hence, if we can show that the\nTaylor series of the two functions at $z_0$ ar equal, we will have shown\nthat $f_1(z) = g_1(z)$ whenever $z < \\epsilon$.\n\nThe $n$-th coefficient of the Taylor series of a function is constructed\nfrom the $n$-th derivative of the function. The $n$-th derivative may be\nexpressed as a limit of $n$-th divided differences\n$$f^{(n)}(z_0) = \\lim_{y_1, \\ldots y_n \\to z_0} {\\Delta^n f (y_1, \\ldots, y_n) \\over \\Delta^n (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)}$$\nSuppose we choose the points at which to compute the divided differences\nas points of the sequence $x_i$. Then we have\n$$f^{(n)}(z_0) = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} {\\Delta^n f (x_{m+1}, \\ldots, x_{m+n}) \\over \\Delta^n (x_{m+1}, \\ldots, x_{m+n})}$$\nSince $f_1(x_i) = f_2(x_i)$, it follows that\n$f_1^{(n)} (z_0) = f_2^{(n)} \n(z_0)$ for all $n$ and hence $f_1(z) = f_2 (z)$ when\n$|z - z-0| < \\epsilon_0$.\n\nIf $D$ happens to be a circle centred about $z_0$, we are done. If not,\nlet $z_1$ be any point of $D$ such that $|z_1 - z_0| \\ge \\epsilon$.\nSince every connected open subset of the plane is arcwise connected,\nthere exists an arc $C$ with endpoints $z_1$ and $z_0$.\n\nDefine the function $M \\colon D \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows\n$$M(z) = \\sup \\{r \\mid |z - w| < r \\Rightarrow w \\in D \\} \\cap [0,1]$$\nBecause $D$ is open, it follows that $0 < M(z) \\le 1$ for all $z \\in D$.\n\nWe will now show that $M$ is continuous. Let $w_1$ and $w_2$ be any two\ndistinct points of $D$. If $M(w_1) > |w_1 - w_2|$, then a disk of radius\n$M(w_1) - |w_1 - w_2|$ about $w_2$ will be contained in the disk of\nradius $M(w_1)$ about $w_1$. Hence, by the definition of $M$, it will\nfollow that $M(w_2) \\ge M(w_1) - |w_1 - w_2|$. Therefore, for any two\npoints $w_1$ and $w_2$, it is the case that\n$|M(w_1) - M(w_2)| \\le |w_1 - w_2|$, which implies that $M$ is\ncontinuous.\n\nSince $M$ is continuous and the arc $C$ is compact, $M$ attains a\nminimum value $m$ on $C$. Let $\\mu > 0$ be chosen smaller strictly less\nthan both $m/2$ and $\\epsilon_0$. Consider the set of all open disks of\nradius $\\mu$ centred about ponts of $C$. By the way $\\mu$ was selected,\neach of these disks lies inside $D$. Since $C$ is compact a finite\nsubset of these disks will serve to cover $D$. In other words, there\nexsits a finite set of points $y_1, y_2, \\ldots y_n$ such that, if\n$z \\in C$, then $|z - y_j| < \\mu$ for some $j \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$. We\nmay assume that the $y_j$\u2019s are ordered so that, as one traverses $C$\nfrom $z_0$ to $z_1$, one encounters $y_j$ before one encounters\n$y_{j+1}$. This imples that $|y_j - y_{j+1}| < \\mu$. Without loss of\ngenerality, we may assume that $y_1 = z_0$ and $y_n = z_1$.\n\nWe shall now show that $f_1 (z) = f_2(z)$ when $|z - y_j| < \\mu$ for all\n$j$ by induction. From our definitions it follows that\n$f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ when $|z - y_1| < \\mu$. Next, we shall now show that\nif $f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ when $|z - y_j| \\le m/2$, then\n$f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ when $|z - y_{j+i}| \\le m/2$. Since\n$|y_j - y_{j+1}| < \\mu$, there exists a point $w \\in C$ and a constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$ such that $|w - z| < \\epsilon$ implies\n$|z - y_j| \\le \\mu$ and $|z - y_{j+i}| \\le \\mu$. By the induction\nhypothesis, $f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ when $|z - y_j| < \\mu$. Consider a disk\nof radius $m$ about $w$. By the definition of $m$, this disk lies inside\n$D$ and, by what we have already shown, $f_1(z) = f_2 (z)$ when\n$|z - w| \\le m$. Since $|w - y_{j+1}| < \\mu < m/2$, it follows from the\ntriangle inequality that $f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ when $|z - y_{j+1}| < \\mu$.\n\nIn particular, the proposition just proven implies that\n$f_1 (z_1) = f_1 (z_1)$ since $z_1 = y_n$. This means that we have shown\nthat $f_1 (z) = f_2 (z)$ for all $z \\in D$.",
