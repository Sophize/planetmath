  "statement": "Suppose $V$ is a proper analytic variety in an open set $U \\subset\n{\\mathbb{C}}^n$ (that is of dimension at most $n-1$) suppose that\n$f \\colon U \\backslash V \\to\n{\\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic and further that $f$ is locally bounded in\n$U$ Then there exists a unique holomorphic extention of $f$ to all of\n$U$.\n\nIf $V$ is of even lower dimension we can in fact even drop the locally\nbounded requirement, see the Hartogs extension theorem.\n\n[9]{} Steven\u00a0G.
