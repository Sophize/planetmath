  "definition": "A square matrix $A$ is called a [*Hurwitz matrix*]{} if all eigenvalues\nof $A$ have strictly negative real part, $Re[\\lambda_i] < 0$; $A$ is\nalso called a [*stability matrix*]{}, because the feedback system\n$$\\dot x = A x$$ is stable.\n\nIf $G(s)$ is a (matrix-valued) transfer function, then $G$ is called\nHurwitz if the poles of all elements of $G$ have negative real part.\nNote that it is not necessary that $G(s)$, for a specific argument $s$,\nbe a Hurwitz matrix \u2014 it need not even be square. The connection is that\nif $A$ is a Hurwitz matrix, then the dynamical system $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\dot x(t) &=& A x(t) + B u(t) \\\\\n  y(t) &=& C x(t) + D u(t)\\end{aligned}$$ has a Hurwitz transfer\nfunction.\n\nReference: Hassan K.
