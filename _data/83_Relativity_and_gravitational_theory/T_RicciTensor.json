  "definition": "#### Definition.\n\nThe *Ricci curvature tensor* is a rank $2$, symmetric tensor that arises\nnaturally in pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Let $(M,g_{ij})$ be a smooth,\n$n$-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and let $R^i{}_{jkl}$ denote\nthe corresponding Riemann curvature tensor. The Ricci tensor $R_{ij}$ is\ncommonly defined as the following contraction of the full curvature\ntensor: $$R_{ij} = R^k{}_{ikj}.$$ The index symmetry of $R_{ij}$, so\ndefined, follows from the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature.\nTo wit,\n$$R_{ij} = R^k{}_{ikj} = R_{ki}{}^k{}_j = R^k{}_{jki} = R_{ji}.$$ It is\nalso convenient to regard the Ricci tensor as a symmetric bilinear form.\nTo that end for vector-fields $X,Y$ we will write\n$${\\operatorname{Ric}}(X,Y) = X^i Y^j R_{ij}.$$\n\n#### Related objects.\n\nContracting the Ricci tensor, we obtain an important scalar invariant\n$$R=R^i{}_i,$$ called the scalar curvature, and sometimes also called\nthe Ricci scalar. Closely related to the Ricci tensor is the tensor\n$$G_{ij} = R_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2} R\\, g_{ij},$$ called the *Einstein\ntensor*. The Einstein tensor is also known as the trace-reversed Ricci\ntensor owing to the fact that $$G^i{}_i = - R.$$ Another related tensor\nis $$S_{ij} = R_{ij} - \\frac{1}{n} R\\, g_{ij}.$$ This is called the\ntrace-free Ricci tensor, owing to the fact that the above definition\nimplies that $$S^i{}_i=0.$$\n\n#### Geometric interpretation.\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, the Ricci tensor represents the average value of\nthe sectional curvature along a particular direction. Let\n$$K_x(u,v) = \\frac{R_x(u,v,v,u)}{g_x(u,u) g_x(v,v) - g_x(u,v)^2}$$\ndenote the sectional curvature of $M$ along the plane spanned by vectors\n$u,v\\in T_x M$. Fix a point $x\\in M$ and a tangent vector $v\\in T_xM$,\nand let $$S_x(v)=\\{ u\\in T_xM \\colon g_x(u,u) = 1,\\; g_x(u,v)=0 \\}$$\ndenote the $n-2$ dimensional sphere of those unit vectors at $x$ that\nare perpendicular to $v$. Let $\\mu_x$ denote the natural\n$(n-2)$-dimensional volume measure on $T_xM$, normalized so that\n$$\\int_{S_x(v)} \\mu_x = 1.$$ In this way, the quantity\n$$\\int_{S_x(v)}\\!\\! K_x(\\cdot,v) \\mu_x,$$ describes the average value of\nthe sectional curvature for all planes in $T_x M$ that contain $v$. It\nis possible to show that\n$${\\operatorname{Ric}}_x(v,v)= (1-n)\\int_{S_x(v)}\\!\\! K_x(\\cdot,v) \\mu_x,$$\nthereby giving us the desired geometric interpretation.\n\n#### Decomposition of the curvature tensor.\n\nFor $n\\geq 3$, the Ricci tensor can be characterized in terms of the\ndecomposition of the full curvature tensor into three covariantly\ndefined summands, namely $$\\begin{aligned}\n  F_{ijkl} &= \\tfrac{1}{n-2} \\left( S_{jl}\\, g_{ik}+S_{ik}\\,\n    g_{jl}-S_{il}\\, g_{jk}-S_{jk}\\, g_{il}\\right),\\\\\n  E_{ijkl} &= \\tfrac{1}{n(n-1)}R \\left( g_{jl}\\,g_{ik} -\n    g_{il}\\,g_{jk}\\right),\\\\\n    W_{ijkl} &= R_{ijkl}-F_{ijkl}-E_{ijkl}.\\end{aligned}$$ The\n$W_{ijkl}$ is called the *Weyl curvature tensor*. It is the conformally\ninvariant, trace-free part of the curvature tensor. Indeed, with the\nabove definitions, we have $$W^k{}_{ikj}=0.$$ The $E_{ijkl}$ and\n$F_{ijkl}$ correspond to the trace-free part of the Ricci curvature\ntensor, and to the Ricci scalar. Indeed, we can recover $S_{ij}$ and $R$\nfrom $E_{ijkl}$ and $F_{ijkl}$ as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}\n  S_{ij} &=  F^k{}_{ikj},\\\\\n  E^{ij}{}_{ij} &= R.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n#### Relativity.\n\nThe Ricci tensor also plays an important role in the theory of general\nrelativity. In this keystone application, $M$ is a 4-dimensional\npseudo-Riemannian manifold with signature $(3,1)$. The Einstein field\nequations assert that the energy-momentum tensor is proportional to the\nEinstein tensor. In particular, the equation $$R_{ij}=0$$ is the field\nequation for a vacuum space-time. In geometry, a pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold that satisfies this equation is called Ricci-flat. It is\npossible to prove that a manifold is Ricci flat if and only if locally,\nthe manifold, is conformally equivalent to flat space.",
