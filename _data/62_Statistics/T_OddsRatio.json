  "definition": "Suppose the probability of an event $A$ is not 1. The *odds* of the\nevent $A$ is the ratio\n$$\\operatorname{odds}(A):=\\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}=\\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}.$$ For\nexample, if the odds of landing a head in a coin flip is 2, then the\nprobability of landing a head is twice as likely as that of landing a\ntail.\n\nIn a $2\\times2$ contingency table, with a dichotomous explanatory\nvariable $X$ having levels 1 and 2, and a binary response variable $Y$\nwith success and failure as two possible levels of outcomes:\n\n       success    failure\n  --- ---------- ----------\n   1   $n_{11}$   $n_{12}$\n   2   $n_{21}$   $n_{22}$\n\nwhere, given the $i$th level of $X$, $n_{i1}$ and $n_{i2}$ are the\ncounts of success and failure, respectively. Two levels of odds for\nsuccess can be formed:\n$$\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=i)=\\frac{n_{i1}/(n_{i1}+n_{i2})}{n_{i2}/(n_{i1}+n_{i2})}=\\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{i2}}\\mbox{, }i=1,2.$$\nWe can form the ratio of these two odds, called the *odds ratio*:\n$$OR_{XY}=\\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=1)}{\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=2)}.$$\nTo interpret odds ratio, we look at some hypothetical examples:\n\n1.  Suppose that, during an average year, 35 out of 100 young drivers\n    get involved in traffic violations, while 10 out of 100 adult\n    drivers are involved. The odds of a young driver getting involved in\n    traffic violations in a typical year is 35/65, and for the adults,\n    it is 10/90. Calculating the odds ratio,\n    $(35/65)/(10/90)\\approx4.85$, and we find that a young driver is\n    almost 5 times as likely to get a traffic ticket as an adult. This\n    indicates that the driver\u2019s age (the explanatory variable) and the\n    chance of getting a traffic ticket (the response variable) might be\n    associated.\n\n2.  Another example. Suppose a die is tossed 100 times and the face with\n    one dot is observed 20 times. Another die twice the size of the\n    first die is tossed 100 times and one is observed 16 times. The odds\n    ratio of getting one between the smaller die and the bigger die is\n    $(20/80)/(16/84)\\approx1.31$, which shows that the odds of getting a\n    one is about the same for the smaller die as for the bigger die.\n\nFrom the two examples above, we see that the odds ratio can be used to\ntest the association of two dichotomous variables. The further away OR\nis from 1, the higher the association is between the two variables.\n\nOn the other hand, the closer to 1 the odds ratio is, the closer to\nindependence between the variables. In fact, odds ratio = 1 iff the two\ndichotomous variables are independent, as can be readily seen in the\nfollowing argument:\n$$OR_{XY}=1\\mbox{ iff }\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=1)=\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=2).$$\nFrom the last equation, we see that $$\\begin{aligned}\nP(Y=success \\mid X=1) &=& \\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=1)}{1+\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=1)} \\\\ \n&=& \\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=2)}{1+\\operatorname{odds}(Y=success \\mid X=2)} \\\\ &=& P(Y=success \\mid X=2).\\end{aligned}$$\nBecause the random variable $X$ is dichotomous, we see that\n$$P(Y=success)=P(Y=success \\mid X=i)\\mbox{, i=1,2}.$$\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   Since the odds ratio lies in the interval $\\lbrack 0,\\infty)$, 1 is\n    highly skewed towards 0. So we see that even though 10 and 0.1 both\n    indicate similar degrees of association, 0.1 is a lot closer to 1\n    than 10 is to 1.\n\n-   By taking the natural log of the odds ratio,\n    $\\operatorname{ln}(OR_{XY})$, we see that the left boundary value 0\n    of the odds ratio is now stretched to $-\\infty$, and testing of\n    independence is now boiled down to testing whether the *log-odds\n    ratio*, is 0 or not. It turns out that the log-odds ratio has an\n    asymptotic normal distribution, which can be used to find the\n    confidence interval of OR.\n\n-   Another way of transforming the odds ratio so as to get a more\n    symmetrical distribution is: $$\\frac{OR-1}{OR+1}.$$ The transformed\n    odds ratio lies in the interval $\\lbrack -1,1 \\rbrack$. This\n    transformed value is also known as the *Yule\u2019s Q*.\n\n-   The use of odds ratios can be generalized to applications of $M$ by\n    $N$ 2-way contingency tables, where $M>2$ and $N\\ge2$, as well as\n    higher way contingency tables involving more than one explanatory\n    variable.\n\n[8]{} A.
