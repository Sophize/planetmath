  "definition": "Before describing what a *Simpson\u2019s paradox* is, let\u2019s start with a\nhypothetical example. During a particular summer, an experiment was\nconducted to find out the preference between two types of beverages:\nsoda and lemonade. The data was drawn from two locations: city and\nrural. In each location, the gender and the choice of drinks were\ncollected. The results are summarized as follows:\n\n   location   gender   lemonade   soda   total   % preferring lemonade  \n  ---------- -------- ---------- ------ ------- ----------------------- --\n              female     150      300     450            24.9%          \n               male      300      660     960            23.1%          \n              female     285      860    1145            33.3%          \n               male       30      100     130            31.3%          \n\nThe odds ratio given that location = city is about 1.1, showing that\nfemales are about 10% more likely to drink lemonade than males. Because\nthe conditional odds ratio given that location = rural is also 1.1, the\nsame conclusion can be drawn.\n\nNext, combine the results from both locations and form the following 2\nby 2 contingency table:\n\n   gender   lemonade   soda   total   % preferring lemonade   odds ratio\n  -------- ---------- ------ ------- ----------------------- ------------\n   female     435      1160   1595            27.3%          \n    male      330      760    1090            30.3%          \n\nThe odds ratio of 0.86 shows that females are about 14% less likely to\ndrink lemonade than males, rather than 10% more likely as was shown\nearlier! This is an example of *Simpson\u2019s paradox*.\n\nIn general, Simpson\u2019s paradox illustrates that the effect of an omission\nof a categorical explanatory variable $Z$ can have on the measure of\nassociation between a categorical explanatory variable $X$ and a\ncategorical response variable $Y$.\n\nIn the example, given the location variable $Z$, the conditional odds\nratios show that the gender variable $X$ and choice of drinks response\nvariable $Y$ have a positive association, with positive log-odds ratios.\nHowever, when the location variable $Z$ is removed, the marginal\nassociation between $X$ and $Y$ is negative, with a negative log-odds\nratio.\n\nOne reason for this apparent paradox is due to the dissimilar\npopulations between the city and the rural groups. In the rural area,\nthe majority of the test subjects are female, whereas in the city area,\nthe majority is male.\n\nFor an excellent explanation of Simpson\u2019s paradox, please refer to the\nbook below.\n\n[8]{} A.
