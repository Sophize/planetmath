  "definition": "### Set-up {#set-up .unnumbered}\n\nAn $n$-dimensional rectangle $S$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ of the\nform $I_1\\times \\cdots \\times I_n$, where each $I_k$ is an interval,\nwith end points $a_k\\le b_k\\in \\mathbb{R}^*$, where $\\mathbb{R}^*$ is\nthe set of extended real numbers (so that $\\mathbb{R}$ itself may be\nconsidered as an interval).\n\n**Groundedness**. A function $C:S\\to \\mathbb{R}$ is said to be\n*grounded* if for each $1\\le k\\le n$, and each $r_j\\in I_j$ where\n$j\\ne k$, the function $C_k:I_k\\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by\n$$C_k(x):=C(r_1,\\ldots,r_{j-1},x,r_{j+1},\\ldots,r_n)$$ is\nright-continuous at $a_k$, the lower end point of $I_k$.\n\n**Margin**. Note that $C_k$ defined above may or may not exist as each\n$r_j\\to b_j$, the upper end point of $I_j$ ($j\\ne k$). If the limit\nexists, then we call this limiting function, also written $C_k$, a\n(one-dimensional) *margin* of $C$:\n$$C_k(x):=\\lim_{r_j\\to b_j}\\ C(r_1,\\ldots,r_{j-1},x,r_{j+1},\\ldots,r_n),\\mbox{ where }j\\in\\lbrace 1,\\ldots,n\\rbrace\\mbox{, }j\\neq i.$$\n\nGiven an $n$-dimensional rectangle $S=I_1\\times \\cdots \\times I_n$,\nlet\u2019s call each $I_k$ a *side* of $S$. A *vertex* of $S$ is a point\n$v\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that each of its coordinates is an end point.\nClearly $S$ is a convex set and the sides and vertices lie on the\nboundary of $S$.\n\n**$C$-volume**. Suppose we have a function $C:S\\to \\mathbb{R}$, with $S$\ndefined as above. Let $T$ be a closed $n$-dimensional rectangle in $S$\n($T\\subseteq S$), with sides $J_k=[c_k,d_k]$, $1\\le k\\le n$. The\n*$C$-volume* of $T$ is the sum\n$$\\operatorname{Vol}_C(T)=\\sum (-1)^{n(v)}C(v)$$ where $v$ is a vertex\nof $T$, $n(v)$ is the number of lower end points that occur in the\ncoordinate representation of $v$, and the sum is taken over all vertices\nof $T$.\n\nThe name is derived from the fact that if\n$C(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=x_1\\cdots x_n$, then for each closed rectangle $T$,\n$\\operatorname{Vol}_C(T)$ is the volume of $T$ in the traditional sense.\n\nNote, however, depending on the function $C$, $\\operatorname{Vol}_C(T)$\nmay be $0$ or even negative. For example, if $C$ is a linear function,\nthen the $C$-volume is identically $0$ for every closed rectangle $T$,\nwhenever $n$ is even. An example where $\\operatorname{Vol}_C(T)$ is\nnegative is given by the function $C(x,y)=-xy$, and $T$ is the unit\nsquare.\n\n**$n$-increasing**. A function $C:S\\to\\mathbb{R}$ where $S$ is an open\n$n$-dimensional rectange is said to be *$n$-increasing* if\n$\\operatorname{Vol}_C$ is non-negative evaluated at each closed\nrectangle $T\\subseteq S$.\n\nAny multivariate distribution function is both grounded and\n$n$-increasing.\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nA copula, introduced by Sklar, is both a variant and a generalization of\na multivariate distribution function.\n\nFormally, a *copula* is a function $C$ from the $n$-dimensional unit\ncube $I^n$ ($I=[0,1]$) to $\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the following\nconditions:\n\n1.  $C$ is $n$-increasing,\n\n2.  $C$ is grounded,\n\n3.  every margin $C_k$ of $C$ is the identity function.\n\nIf we replace the domain by any $n$-dimensional rectangle $S$, then the\nresulting function is called a *subcopula*.\n\nFor example, the functions $C(x,y,z)=xyz$, $C(x,y,z)=\\min(x,y,z)$, and\n$C(x,y,z)=\\max(0,(x+y+z-2))$ defined on the unit cube are all copulas.\n\n(This entry is in the process of being expanded, more to come shortly).\n\n[8]{} B.
