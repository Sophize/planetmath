  "definition": "Cramer\u2019s V is a statistic measuring the strength of association or\ndependency between two (nominal) categorical variables in a contingency\ntable.\\\n\\\n**Setup.** Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two categorical variables that are to\nbe analyzed in a some experimental or observational data with the\nfollowing information:\n\n-   $X$ has $M$ distinct categories or classes, labeled\n    $X_1,\\ldots,X_M$,\n\n-   $Y$ has $N$ distinct categories, labeled $Y_1,\\ldots,Y_N$,\n\n-   $n$ pairs of observations $(x_k,y_k)$ are taken, where $x_i$ belongs\n    to one of the $M$ categories in $X$ and $y_i$ belongs to one of the\n    $N$ categories in $Y$.\n\nForm a $M\\times N$ contingency table such that Cell $(i,j)$ contains the\ncount $n_{ij}$ of occurrences of Category $X_i$ in $X$ and Category\n$Y_j$ in $Y$:\n\n   $X\\backslash Y$    $Y_1$      $Y_2$     $\\cdots$    $Y_N$\n  ----------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------\n        $X_1$        $n_{11}$   $n_{12}$   $\\cdots$   $n_{1N}$\n        $X_2$        $n_{21}$   $n_{22}$   $\\cdots$   $n_{2N}$\n      $\\vdots$       $\\vdots$   $\\vdots$   $\\ddots$   $\\vdots$\n        $X_M$        $n_{M1}$   $n_{M2}$   $\\cdots$   $n_{MN}$\n\nNote that $n=\\sum n_{ij}$.\\\n\\\n**Definition.** Suppose that the null hypothesis is that $X$ and $Y$ are\nindependent random variables. Based on the table and the null\nhypothesis, the chi-squared statistic $\\chi^2$ can be computed. Then,\n*Cramer\u2019s V* is defined to be\n$$V=V(X,Y)=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2}{n\\operatorname{min}(M-1,N-1)}}.$$ Of\ncourse, in order for $V$ to make sense, each categorical variable must\nhave at least 2 categories.\\\n\\\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  $0\\leq V\\leq 1$. The closer $V$ is to 0, the smaller the association\n    between the categorical variables $X$ and $Y$. On the other hand,\n    $V$ being close to 1 is an indication of a strong association\n    between $X$ and $Y$. If $X=Y$, then $V(X,Y)=1$.\n\n2.  When comparing more than two categorical variables, it is customary\n    to set up a square matrix, where cell $(i,j)$ represents the\n    Cramer\u2019s V between the $i$th variable and the $j$th variable. If\n    there are $n$ variables, there are $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ Cramer\u2019s V\u2019s\n    to calculate, since, for any discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$,\n    $V(X,X)=1$ and $V(X,Y)=V(Y,X)$. Consequently, this matrix is\n    symmetric.\n\n3.  If one of the categorical variables is dichotomous, (either $M$ or\n    $N=2$), Cramer\u2019s V is equal to the *phi statistic* ($\\Phi$), which\n    is defined to be $$\\Phi=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2}{n}}.$$\n\n4.  Cramer\u2019s V is named after the Swedish mathematician and statistician\n    Harald Cram\u00e9r, who sought to make statistics mathematically\n    rigorous, much like Kolmogorov\u2019s axiomatization of probability\n    theory. Cram\u00e9r also made contributions to number theory, probability\n    theory, and actuarial mathematics widely used by the insurance\n    industry.\n\n[8]{} A.
