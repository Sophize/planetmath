  "definition": "Given a random sample of $N$ observations\n$\\textbf{Z}_i=(Y_i,X_{i1},\\ldots,X_{ik})$ where\n\n1.  the response variables $Y_i$ are identically distributed as $Y$\n\n2.  $Y$ is categorical in nature (coming from a multinomial\n    distribution)\n\n3.  each of the explanatory variables $X_{ij}$ is categorical in nature\n\nThen we can analyze the data by forming a *contingency table*. The table\nis customarily formed by labeling the categories for the response across\nthe top, and then the combinations of the levels for each explanatory\nvariable down the left-most columns. Then the cells are filled with\ncounts or frequencies of occurrences corresponding to the specific\nexplanatory variable level combination to the left and the response to\nthe top.\n\nThe simplest example of a contingency table is where the response\nvariable $Y$ comes from a binomial distribution (with two possible\nresponses $r_1$ and $r_2$) and there is only one explanatory variable\n$X$, which has only two levels, $A_1$ and $A_2$. This is an instance of\na *2 way contingency table*:\n\n            $r_1$      $r_2$\n  ------- ---------- ----------\n   $A_1$   $n_{11}$   $n_{12}$\n   $A_2$   $n_{21}$   $n_{22}$\n\nwhere $n_{ij}$ corresponds to the count or frequency of level $A_i$ and\nresponse $r_j$.\n\n**Example** A penny $P$ and a quarter $Q$ are each tossed separately 100\ntimes. The outcome for each toss is recorded, $H$ for head and $T$ for\ntail. The numbers of heads and tails obtained from the tosses are\nrecorded in the following 2 way table:\n\n   Coin Type   $H$   $T$\n  ----------- ----- -----\n      $P$      45    55\n      $Q$      56    44\n\nA *3 way contingency table* consists of one response variable and two\nexplanatory variables.\n\n**Example** Four dice are used in an experiment to test whether they are\nmore or less the \u201csame\u201d (having the same probability distribution). Each\ndie comes from a combination of one of two casinos, $C_1$ and $C_2$,\nmade by one of two manufacturers, $M_1$ and $M_2$. Furthermore, no two\ndice have the same combination. Now, each dice is tossed 120 times and\nthe outcomes (1 through 6) are recorded. We have the following\ncontingency table:\n\n   Casino   Manufacturer   1    2    3    4    5    6\n  -------- -------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----\n               $M_1$       17   21   19   20   22   21\n               $M_2$       22   20   20   19   21   18\n               $M_1$       21   18   18   23   21   19\n               $M_2$       20   19   18   21   21   21\n\nThe explanatory variables are the casinos ($C$\u2019s) and the manufacturers\n($M$\u2019s), and the response variable is the number appearing on the top\nface of a thrown die ($1$ through $6$).",
