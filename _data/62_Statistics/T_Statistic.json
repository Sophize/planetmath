  "definition": "A *statistic*, or *sample statistic*, $S$ is simply a function, usually\nreal-valued, of a set of (sample) data or observations\n$\\boldsymbol{X}=(X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n)$: $S=S(\\boldsymbol{X})$. More\nformally, let $\\Omega$ be the sample space of the data $\\boldsymbol{X}$,\nthen $S$ is a function from $\\Omega$ to some set $T$, usually a subset\nof $\\mathbb{R}^k$. The data $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is usually considered as a\nvector of iid random variables $X_i$.\n\n**Examples**\n\n1.  100 light bulbs out of 1,000,000 are tested for their functionality.\n    Then the number $n$, of defective light bulbs in the 100 samples is\n    a statistic. To see this, define, for each $i$ from 1 to 100,\n    $$x_i = \n    \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if the event }X_i=\\lbrace \\text{the }i\\text{th light bulb is defective}\\rbrace \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n    \\end{cases}$$ Then $n=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i$, a function of the data.\n    Similarly, the number of operating light bulbs is also a statistic\n    if we switch the 1 and 0 in the above definitions for the $x_i$\u2019s.\n    If we make all $x_i=1$, then $n$ is just the count of the\n    observations, one of the simplest forms of sample statistics. If we\n    make all $x_i=0$, then $n=0$ is a statistic that is not at all\n    useful.\n\n2.  Let $w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_{20}$ be the weights of 20 students from a\n    particular college. Then the average weight defined by\n    $$\\overline{w}=\\frac{1}{20}\\sum_{i=1}^{20}w_i$$ is a statistic. It\n    is commonly called the *sample mean*. It is often used to estimate\n    $\\operatorname{E}[X]$, the expectation of a particular random\n    variable, which, in this case, is the weight of a student in the\n    college. Of course, other averages, such as medians, mode, trimmed\n    mean, are also examples of (sample) statistics.\n\n3.  Using the same example as in (2), we can define\n    $$s^2=\\frac{1}{20-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{20}(w_i-\\overline{w})^2.$$ This is\n    also a statistic, for, after some substitution and rewriting,\n    $$s^2=\\frac{1}{20-1}\\Big[\\sum_{i=1}^{20}{w_i}^2-\\frac{1}{20}(\\sum_{i=1}^{20}{w_i)}^2\\Big],$$\n    which is a function explicitly in terms of the $w_i$\u2019s. This\n    statistic is known as the *sample variance*, which is a common\n    estimate of $\\operatorname{Var}[X]$, the variance of the random\n    variable $X$. Again, in this example, the $X$ is the weight of a\n    student in the college.\n\n4.  Again, borrowing from the same example above, we can simply order\n    the weights of the 20 students in an ascending order, so we get a\n    vector of 20 real numbers $(w_{(1)},w_{(2)},\\ldots,w_{(20)})$. This\n    is also a statistic, called an order statistic. It is not\n    real-valued and its range is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{20}$.\n\n5.  Given a set of numeric observations $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$, without\n    knowing the distribution of these observations, one can define what\n    is known as the empirical distribution function $\\hat{F}$, which is\n    a real-valued function, based on the observations. This is an\n    example of a statistic whose range is a function space.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Any function of a statistic is again a statistic.\n\n-   Since the underlying data is assumed to be random, a statistic is\n    necessarily a random variable.\n\n-   Although mostly real-valued, a statistic can be vector-valued, or\n    even function-valued as we have seen in earlier examples.",
