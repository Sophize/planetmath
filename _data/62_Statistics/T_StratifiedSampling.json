  "definition": "In sampling surveys, it is sometimes a good idea to break up the\npopulation into subdivisions before any sampling were to take place. For\nexample, from a population $U$ of automobile insurance policies, the\nclaim frequencies (loosely speaking, this is the ratio of the number of\nclaims to the number of policies in the $U$) are found in the following\ntable:\n\n   male drivers   female drivers   all drivers\n  -------------- ---------------- -------------\n      $10\\%$          $7\\%$           $9\\%$\n\nSuppose that we would like to take a sample from $U$ so that when the\nsample units are divided up into male drivers and female drivers, the\nrespective sample claim frequencies are more or less $10\\%$ and $7\\%$.\nHow would we do this? If a simple random sample is taken directly from\nthe population, we may get the total claim frequency (for all drivers)\nto be more or less $9\\%$, but when the sample is broken down into two\ngroups by gender, we may no longer guarantee that the claim frequencies\nby gender match (more or less) those calculated from the population. To\ninsure that the sample taken preserves claim frequencies by gender, we\nwould take a *stratified sampling*.\\\n\\\nFormally, in *stratified sampling*, the following steps are taken, in\norder, from a population $U$ of $N$ units:\n\n1.  Decide what subdivisions are to be analyzed from within $U$ and what\n    information (or statistics) within the subdivisions should be\n    \u201cpreserved\u201d. For example, if we want to analyze our data by gender,\n    then we would have two subdivisions to study. If there is more than\n    one categorical variable, then we would look at all the *possible*\n    combinations of the these variables.\n\n2.  Make sure all the possible combinations are mutually exclusive\n    events;\n\n3.  Divide $U$ into $k$ subdivisions, or *strata*, $U_i$, where $k$ is\n    the total number of possible combinations described above. From the\n    first two steps, we have $$U=U_1\\cup U_2\\cup\\ldots\n    U_k \\mbox{ such that }U_i\\cap U_j=\\varnothing,$$ for all $i\\neq j$\n    and $1\\leq i,j\\leq k$. In addition, if we let $N_i=\\lvert U_i\n    \\rvert$, then $$N=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}N_i.$$\n\n4.  Draw a sample $S_i$ from each stratum $U_i$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   When each $S_i$ is a simple random sample within each $U_i$, then we\n    call this procedure a *stratified random sampling*.\n\n-   Each stratum corresponds to a number $$W_i:=\\frac{N}{N_i},$$ called\n    a *stratum weight*.\n\n-   Suppose each sample $S_i$ contains $n_i$ units ($\\lvert S_i\n    \\rvert = n_i$) and that $n=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i$. We call the\n    stratified sampling *proportional* if, for each $i$,\n    $$\\frac{n}{n_i}=W_i.$$",
