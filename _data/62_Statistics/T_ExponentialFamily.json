  "definition": "A probability (density) function $f_X(x\\mid\\theta)$ given a parameter\n$\\theta$ is said to belong to the (one parameter) *exponential family*\nof distributions if it can be written in one of the following two\nequivalent forms:\n\n1.  $a(x)b(\\theta)\\operatorname{exp}\\big[ c(x)d(\\theta)\\big ]$\n\n2.  $\\operatorname{exp}\\big[ a(x)+b(\\theta)+c(x)d(\\theta) \\big]$\n\nwhere $a,b,c,d$ are known functions. If $c(x)=x$, then the distribution\nis said to be in *canonical form*. When the distribution is in canonical\nform, the function $d(\\theta)$ is called a *natural parameter*. Other\nparameters present in the distribution that are not of any interest, or\nthat are already calculated in advance, are called *nuisance\nparameters*.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n-   The normal distribution, $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, treating $\\sigma^2$ as a\n    nuisance parameter, belongs to the exponential family. To see this,\n    take the natural logarithm of $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ to get\n    $$-\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{ln}(2\\pi\\sigma^2)-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2$$\n    Rearrange the above expression and we have\n    $$\\frac{x\\mu}{\\sigma^2}-\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\Big[\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}+\\operatorname{ln}(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\\Big]$$\n    Set $c(x)=x$, $d(\\mu)=\\mu/\\sigma^2$, $b(\\mu)=-\\mu^2/(2\\sigma^2)$,\n    and\n    $a(x)=-1/2\\big[x^2/\\sigma^2+\\operatorname{ln}(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\\big]$.\n    Then we see that $N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ does indeed belong to the\n    exponential family. Furthermore, it is in canonical form. The\n    natural parameter is $d(\\mu)=\\mu/\\sigma^2$.\n\n-   Similarly, the Poisson, binomial, Gamma, and inverse Gaussian\n    distributions all belong to the exponential family and they are all\n    in canonical form.\n\n-   Lognormal and Weibull distributions also belong to the exponential\n    family but they are not in canonical form.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   If the p.d.f of a random variable $X$ belongs to an exponential\n    family, and it is expressed in the second of the two above forms,\n    then $$\\operatorname{E}[c(X)]=-\\frac{b'(\\theta)}{d'(\\theta)},$$\n\n    and\n\n    $$\\operatorname{Var}[c(X)]=\\frac{d''(\\theta)b'(\\theta)-d'(\\theta)b''(\\theta)}{d'(\\theta)^3},$$\n\n    provided that functions $b$ and $d$ are appropriately conditioned.\n\n-   Given a member from the exponential family of distributions, we have\n    $\\operatorname{E}[U]=0$ and $I=-\\operatorname{E}[U']$, where $U$ is\n    the score function and $I$ the Fisher information. To see this,\n    first observe that the log-likelihood function from a member of the\n    exponential family of distributions is given by\n    $$\\ell(\\theta\\mid x)=a(x)+b(\\theta)+c(x)d(\\theta),$$ and hence the\n    score function is $$U(\\theta)=b'(\\theta)+c(X)d'(\\theta).$$ From (1),\n    $\\operatorname{E}[U]=0$. Next, we obtain the Fisher information $I$.\n    By definition, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n    I&=&\\operatorname{E}[U^2]-\\operatorname{E}[U]^2\\\\\n    &=&\\operatorname{E}[U^2]\\\\\n    &=&d'(\\theta)^2\\operatorname{Var}[c(X)]\\\\\n    &=&\\frac{d''(\\theta)b'(\\theta)-d'(\\theta)b''(\\theta)}{d'(\\theta)}\\end{aligned}$$\n    On the other hand,\n    $$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial\\theta}=b''(\\theta)+c(X)d''(\\theta)$$ so\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\operatorname{E}\\Big[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial\\theta}\\Big]\n    &=&b''(\\theta)+\\operatorname{E}[c(X)]d''(\\theta)\\\\\n    &=&b''(\\theta)-\\frac{b'(\\theta)}{d'(\\theta)}d''(\\theta)\\\\\n    &=&\\frac{b''(\\theta)d'(\\theta)-b'(\\theta)d''(\\theta)}{d'(\\theta)}\\\\\n    &=&-I\\end{aligned}$$\n\n-   For example, for a Poisson distribution\n    $$f_X(x\\mid\\theta) = \\frac{\\theta^x e^{-\\theta}}{x!},$$ the natural\n    parameter $d(\\theta)$ is $\\operatorname{ln}\\theta$ and\n    $b(\\theta)=-\\theta$. $c(x)=x$ since Poisson is in canonical form.\n    Then\n    $$U(\\theta)=-1+\\frac{X}{\\theta}\\mbox{ and }I=-\\operatorname{E}\\Big[\\frac{-X}{\\theta^2}\\Big]=\\frac{1}{\\theta}$$\n    as expected.",
