  "definition": "Below is a table of the values of the area (probabilities) $\\Phi(z)$\nunder the standard normal distribution function\n$N(1,0)=\\operatorname{exp}(-x^2/2)$ given by\n$$\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^z N(1,0) \\, dx\\,,$$\nevaluated from $-\\infty$ to various $z$-scores. The values are rounded\nto the nearest ten thousandths.\n\nGraphically, this looks like\n\n(-2,-0.2)(2,1) (0,0)(-2,0)(2,1) (2,0)[x]{}(0,0.9)[y]{} (-1.8,0)(0.4,2)\n(0.4,-0.05)[$z$]{} (-0.1,0.4)[$\\Phi(z)$]{}\n\nwhere the curve is the probability density function $N(0,1)$ of the\nstandard normal distribution (with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$),\n$z$ on the $x$-axis is the $z$-score, and $\\Phi(z)$ (represented by the\nlight gray region) is the area bounded by $N(0,1)$, the $x$-axis, and\n$x\\le z$.\n\n### Finding $\\Phi(z)$ from $z$ {#finding-phiz-from-z .unnumbered}\n\nGiven a $z$-score, one can easily find $\\Phi(z)$ as follows:\n\n1.  round the $z$-score $z$ to the nearest hundredths decimal place; for\n    example, if $z=1.2345$, then rounding it to the hundredths gives you\n    $1.23$.\n\n2.  if $0\\le z\\le 4$, write $z=a+b$, where $a$ is the truncation of $r$\n    at the tenths place, and $b=r-a$; for example, if $z=1.23$, then\n    $a=1.2$ and $b=0.03$.\n\n3.  locate $a$ in the first column of the table, and then locate $b$ in\n    the first row of the table\n\n4.  find the value in the cell corresponding to row $a$ and column $b$;\n    this value is $\\Phi(z)$; for example, if $a=1.2$ and $b=0.03$, then\n    the corresponding value is $0.8907$.\n\nIf $z>4$, then $\\Phi(z)=1$ when rounded to the nearest ten thousandths.\nIf $z<0$, then we will not be able to use the table above. However,\nsince $N(0,1)$ is an even function, $\\Phi(z)$, the area bounded by\n$N(0,1)$, the $x$-axis, and $x\\le z$ is the same as the area bounded by\n$N(0,1)$, the $x$-axis, and $x\\ge -z$, which is equal to $1-\\Phi(-z)$.\nThese two facts can be summarized:\n\n1.  If $z>4$, then $\\Phi(z)=1$ when rounded to the nearest ten\n    thousandths to the right of the decimal point.\n\n2.  If $z<0$, then use the formula $\\Phi(z)=1-\\Phi(-z)$ before applying\n    the table. For example, $\\Phi(-1.23)=1-\\Phi(1.23)=1-0.8907=0.1093$.\n\nAlso, we may use linear interpolation to find (approximate) $\\Phi(z)$\nfor any arbitrary $z$-score. For example, if we want to compute\n$\\Phi(1.234)$, then we first find $\\Phi(1.23)$ and $\\Phi(1.24)$. Then\n$$\\Phi(1.234)\\approx 0.6\\cdot \\Phi(1.23)+ 0.4\\cdot \\Phi(1.24)=0.6\\cdot 0.8907+0.4\\cdot 0.8925 \\approx 0.8914.$$\n\n### Finding $z$ from $\\Phi(z)$ {#finding-z-from-phiz .unnumbered}\n\nGiven $\\Phi(z)$, we may use the table to find $z$. The process works in\nreverse of the process presented in the previous section:\n\n1.  round $r=\\Phi(z)$ to the nearest ten thousandths; for example if\n    $\\Phi(z)=0.91236$, then $r=0.9124$ after rounding\n\n2.  if $0.5\\le r\\le 1$, then find the cell in the table with value as\n    close to $r$ as possible; for example, for $r=0.9124$, the closest\n    value that can be found in the table is $0.9131$\n\n3.  if this cell is found, then find the corresponding value $a$ in the\n    first column and $b$ in the first row, and $z^*=a+b$ is the\n    approximate $z$-score that we are looking for; for example, $0.9131$\n    corresponds to $a=1.3$ and $b=0.06$ so that $z^*=1.36$.\n\n4.  if $\\Phi(z)<0.5$, then use $r=1-\\Phi(z)$ to find $z^*$ using the\n    first three steps above. Then $z=-z^*$ is the $z$-score that we are\n    looking for.\n\nNote that if $\\Phi(z)=1$, then any $z\\ge 3.9$ will work. Also, linear\ninterpolation can again be applied to get better approximations of the\n$z$-scores given $\\Phi(z)$. For example, $\\Phi(z)=0.91236$ is between\n$0.9115$ and $0.9131$, two consecutive values found in the table, and\ncan be written\n$$0.91236 \\approx 0.4625 \\cdot 0.9115 + 0.5375 \\cdot 0.9131.$$ So, the\n$z$-score corresponding to $0.91236$ can be obtained similarly\n$$0.4625 \\cdot 1.35 + 0.5375 \\cdot 1.36 \\approx 1.3554 \\approx z,$$\nwhere $1.35$ is the $z$-score for $0.9115$ and $1.36$ is the $z$-score\nfor $0.9131$.",
