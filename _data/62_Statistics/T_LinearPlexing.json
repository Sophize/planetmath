But associated with each normalized test of\nsignificance is $\\gamma$, the probability of commiting a type $I$ error.\n\nNotice that as we make $\\gamma$ smaller, the smaller the critical region\nbecomes and thus the larger the value of the test statistic must be for\nthe null hypothesis to be rejected.\n\nFind $p$, defined as the smallest $\\gamma$ for which we can still reject\n$H_0$.\n\nReject $H_0$ if $\\alpha < p$.",
