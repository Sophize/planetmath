  "definition": "In statistical modeling of $N$ data observations ($N<\\infty$), two types\nof variables are usually defined. One is the response variable or\nvariate, usually denoted by $Y$, and the other is the explanatory\nvariable or covariate $X$. While there is only one response variable,\nthere may be one or more than one explanatory variables. The response\nvariable is considered random, where as the explanatory variable(s) may\nor may not be random.\n\nBased on the above setup, a *general linear model*, or *normal linear\nmodel*, is a statistical model with the following assumptions:\n\n1.  the response variable $Y$ is a continuous random variable\n\n2.  the response variable $Y$ can be expressed as a linear combination\n    of functions $z_i(\\textbf{X})$, of the explanatory variables, plus a\n    random error term $\\varepsilon$:\n    $$Y=\\beta_0z_0(\\textbf{X})+\\cdots+\\beta_kz_k(\\textbf{X})+\\varepsilon.$$\n    The portion of $Y$ without the error term is known as the\n    *systematic component* of $Y$.\n\n3.  the error component and the systematic component are independent\n\n4.  random error variables $\\varepsilon_i$ for the $N$ observations are\n    iid normal with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   Conditioning on the explanatory variables, the random variables\n    $Y_i$ corresponding to the individual responses are independent,\n    normally distributed, with mean\n    $$\\mu=\\operatorname{E}[Y\\mid\\textbf{X}=\\boldsymbol{x}]=\\beta_0z_0(\\textbf{X})+\\cdots+\\beta_kz_k(\\textbf{X})$$\n    and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\n-   A linear regression model is a special case of the general linear\n    model where all explanatory variables are assumed to be continuous.\n\n-   *Analysis of variance* model, or *ANOVA*, is another special case of\n    the general linear model, where all of the explantory variables are\n    categorical in nature (for example, gender, marital status, etc..).\n\n-   *Analysis of covariance*, or *ANCOVA*, sits between a linear\n    regression model and the ANOVA, where some of the explanatory\n    variables are continuous and some are categorical.\n\n-   The general linear model is a special case of the *generalized\n    linear model*, where the assumption that the response variable $Y$\n    has a normal distribution is dropped.",
