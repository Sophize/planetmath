  "definition": "A $\\tau$-$(\\nu,\\kappa,\\lambda)$ [**design**]{}, aka\n$\\tau$[**-design**]{} or [**block design**]{}, is an incidence structure\n$(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{B},\\mathcal{I})$ with\n\n-   $|\\mathcal{P}| = \\nu$ points in all,\n\n-   $|\\mathcal{P}_B| = \\kappa$ points in each block $B$, and such that\n\n-   any set $T\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$ of $|T|=\\tau$ points occurs as\n    subset $T\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}_B$ in exactly $\\lambda$ blocks.\n\nThe numbers $\\tau,\\nu,\\kappa,lambda$ are called the parameters of a\ndesign. They are often called $t$, $v$, $k$, $\\lambda$ (in mixed Latin\nand Greek alphabets) by some authors.\n\nGiven parameters $\\tau,\\nu,\\kappa,lambda$, there may be several\nnon-isomorphic designs, or no designs at all.\n\nDesigns need not be simple (they can have [**repeated blocks**]{}), but\nthey usually are (and don\u2019t) in which case $B$ can again be used as\nsynonym for $\\mathcal{P}_B$.\n\n-   0-designs ($\\tau=0$) are allowed.\n\n-   1-designs ($\\tau=1$) are known as [**tactical configurations**]{}.\n\n-   2-designs are called [**balanced incomplete block designs**]{} or\n    [**BIBD**]{}.\n\n-   3, 4, 5\u2026\u00a0-designs have all been studied.\n\nBeing a $\\tau$-$(\\nu,\\kappa,\\lambda)$ design implies also being an\n$\\iota$-$(\\nu,\\kappa,\\lambda_{\\,\\iota})$ design for every\n$0\\le\\iota\\le\\tau$ (on the same $\\nu$ points and with the same block\nsize $\\kappa$), with $\\lambda_{\\,\\iota}$ given by\n$\\lambda_{\\,\\tau}=\\lambda$ and recursively\n$$\\lambda_{\\,\\iota} \\,=\\; {\\nu-\\iota \\over \\kappa-\\iota} \\,\\lambda_{\\,\\iota+1}$$\nfrom which we get the number of blocks as\n$$\\lambda_0 \\,=\\; {\\nu!\\,/\\,(\\nu-\\tau)! \\over \\kappa!\\,/\\,(\\kappa-\\tau)!}\n            \\;=\\; {\\nu\\choose\\tau} \\bigg/ {\\kappa\\choose\\tau}$$ Being a\n0-design says nothing more than all blocks having the same size. As soon\nas we have $\\tau\\ge1$ however we also have a 1-design, so the number\n$\\lambda_1 = |\\mathcal{B}_P|$ of blocks per point $P$ is constant\nthroughout the structure. Note now\n$$\\lambda_0\\,\\kappa \\;=\\; \\lambda_1\\,\\nu$$ which is also evident from\ntheir interpretation.\n\nAs an example: designs (simple designs) with $\\kappa=2$ are multigraphs\n(simple [**graphs**]{}), now\n\n-   $\\tau=0$ implies no more than that,\n\n-   $\\tau=1$ gives [**regular graphs**]{}, and\n\n-   $\\tau=2$ gives [**complete graphs**]{}.\n\nA more elaborate \u201clambda calculus\u201d (pun intended) can be introduced as\nfollows. Let $I\\subseteq P$ and $O\\subseteq P$ with $|I|=\\iota$ and\n$|O|=o$. The number of blocks $B$ such that all the points of $I$ are\ninside $B$ and all the points of $O$ are outside $B$ is independent of\nthe choice of $I$ and $O$, only depending on $\\iota$ and $o$, provided\n$\\iota+o\\le\\tau$. Call this number $\\lambda_\\iota^o$. It satisfies a\nkind of reverse Pascal triangle like recursion $$\\lambda_\\iota^o \\,=\\,\n  \\lambda_{\\iota+1}^o +\n  \\lambda_\\iota^{o+1}$$ that starts off for $o=0$ with\n$\\lambda_\\iota^0 = \\lambda_\\iota$. An important quantity (for designs\nwith $\\tau\\ge2$) is the [**order**]{}\n$\\lambda_1^1 = \\lambda_1^0 - \\lambda_2^0 = \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2$.\n\nFinally, the dual of a design can be a design but need not be.\n\n-   A [**square design**]{} aka [**symmetric design**]{} is one where\n    $\\tau=2$ and $|\\mathcal{P}|=|\\mathcal{B}|$, now also\n    $|\\mathcal{P}_B|=|\\mathcal{B}_P|$. Here the dual is also a square\n    design.\n\nNote that for $\\tau\\ge3$ no designs exist with\n$|\\mathcal{P}|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ other than trivial ones (where any\n$\\kappa=\\nu-1$ points form a block).",
