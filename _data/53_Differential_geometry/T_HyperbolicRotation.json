  "definition": "Let $\\mathbb{E}$ be the Euclidean plane equipped with the Cartesian\ncoordinate system. Recall that given a circle $C$ centered at the origin\n$O$, one can define an \u201cordinary\u201d rotation $R$ to be a linear\ntransformation that takes any point on $C$ to another point on $C$. In\nother words, $R(C)\\subseteq C$.\n\nSimilarly, given a rectangular hyperbola (the counterpart of a circle)\n$H$ centered at the origin, we define a *hyperbolic rotation* (with\nrespect to $H$) as a linear transformation $T$ (on $\\mathbb{E}$) such\nthat $T(H)\\subseteq H$.\n\nSince a hyperbolic rotation is defined as a linear transformation, let\nus see what it looks like in matrix form. We start with the simple case\nwhen a rectangular hyperbola $H$ has the form $xy=r$, where $r$ is a\nnon-negative real number.\n\nSuppose $T$ denotes a hyperbolic rotation such that $T(H)\\subseteq H$.\nSet\n\n$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$\n\nwhere $\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}$ is the matrix representation of $T$, and $xy=x'y'=r$.\nSolving for $a,b,c,d$ and we get $ad=1$ and $b=c=0$. In other words,\nwith respect to rectangular hyperbolas of the form $xy=r$, the matrix\nrepresentation of a hyperbolic rotation looks like\n\n$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & a^{-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$\n\nSince the matrix is non-singular, we see that in fact $T(H)=H$.\n\nNow that we know the matrix form of a hyperbolic rotation when the\nrectangular hyperbolas have the form $xy=r$, it is not hard to solve the\ngeneral case. Since the two asymptotes of any rectangular hyperbola $H$\nare perpendicular, by an appropriate change of bases (ordinary\nrotation), $H$ can be transformed into a rectangular hyperbola $H'$\nwhose asymptotes are the $x$ and $y$ axes, so that $H'$ has the\nalgebraic form $xy=r$. As a result, the matrix representation of a\nhyperbolic rotation $T$ with respect to $H$ has the form\n\n$\nP\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & a^{-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\nP^{-1}\n$\n\nfor some $0\\ne a\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and some orthogonal matrix $P$. In other\nwords, $T$ is diagonalizable with $a$ and $a^{-1}$ as eigenvalues ($T$\nis non-singular as a result).\n\nBelow are some simple properties:\n\n-   Unlike an ordinary rotation $R$, where $R$ fixes any circle centered\n    at $O$, a hyperbolic rotation $T$ fixing one rectangular hyperbola\n    centered at $O$ may not fix another hyperbola of the same kind (as\n    implied by the discussion above).\n\n-   Let $P$ be the pencil of all rectangular hyperbolas centered at $O$.\n    For each $H\\in P$, let $[H]$ be the subset of $P$ containing all\n    hyperbolas whose asymptotes are same as the asymptotes for $H$. If a\n    hyperbolic rotation $T$ fixing $H$, then $T(H')=H'$ for any\n    $H'\\in [H]$.\n\n-   $[\\cdot]$ defined above partitions $P$ into disjoint subsets. Call\n    each of these subset a sub-pencil. Let $A$ be a sub-pencil of $P$.\n    Call $T$ fixes $A$ if $T$ *fixes* any element of $A$. Let $A\\ne B$\n    be sub-pencils of $P$. Then $T$ fixes $A$ iff $T$ does not fix $B$.\n\n-   Let $A,B$ be sub-pencils of $P$. Let $T,S$ be hyperbolic rotations\n    such that $T$ fixes $A$ and $S$ fixes $B$. Then $T\\circ S$ is a\n    hyperbolic rotation iff $A=B$.\n\n-   In other words, the set of all hyperbolic rotations fixing a\n    sub-pencil is closed under composition. In fact, it is a group.\n\n-   Let $T$ be a hyperbolic rotation fixing the hyperbola $xy=r$. Then\n    $T$ fixes its branches (connected components) iff $T$ has positive\n    eigenvalues.\n\n-   $T$ preserves area.\n\n-   Suppose $T$ fixes the unit hyperbola $H$. Let $P,Q\\in H$. Then $T$\n    fixes the (measure of) hyperbolic angle between $P$ and $Q$. In\n    other words, if $\\alpha$ is the measure of the hyperbolic angle\n    between $P$ and $Q$ and, by abuse of notation, let $T(\\alpha)$ be\n    the measure of the hyperbolic angle between $T(P)$ and $T(Q)$. Then\n    $\\alpha = T(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe definition of a hyperbolic rotation can be generalized into an\narbitrary two-dimensional vector space: it is any diagonalizable linear\ntransformation with a pair of eigenvalues $a,b$ such that $ab=1$.",
