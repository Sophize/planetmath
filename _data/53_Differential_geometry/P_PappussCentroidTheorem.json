  "statement": "The surface of revolution generated by a smooth curve $\\gamma$ in the\nxz-plane (with $x \\geq 0$), rotated about the z axis, has surface area\n$$A = sd\\,,$$ where $s$ is the arc length of $\\gamma$, and $d$ is the\ndistance travelled by the centroid $\\mu$ of $\\gamma$ under a full\nrotation. (The centroid is also called the centre of mass, assuming the\ncurve has uniform line density.)\n\nThe solid of revolution generated by a region (Lebesgue-measurable set)\n$\\mathcal{S}$ in the xz-plane (with $x \\geq 0$) rotated about the z\naxis, has volume $$V = Ad\\,,$$ where $A$ is the area of $\\mathcal{S}$,\nand $d$ is the distance travelled by the centroid $\\mu$ of $\\mathcal{S}$\nunder a full rotation.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, these two theorems are known as Pappus\u2019s\ntheorems, after the ancient Greek geometer Pappus of Alexandria. In\ncontinental Europe, these theorems are more commonly associated with the\nname of Paul Guldin (who rediscovered them): e.g. in German \u201cdie\nguldinsche Regeln\u201d; in Finnish \u201cGuldinin s\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00f6t\u201d; in French \u201cle\nth\u00e9or\u00e8me de Guldin\u201d.\n\nThe surface area of the torus, with the generating circle having radius\n$r$, and ring \u201cradius\u201d $R$ (measured from the centre of the torus to the\ncentre of the generating circle), is $A = (2\\pi r)(2\\pi R) = 4\\pi^2 rR$.\nWe used here the obvious fact that the centroid of a circle is at its\ncentre.\n\nThe volume of the (solid) torus, with the same parameters as above, is\n$V = (\\pi r^2) (2\\pi R) = 2\\pi^2 r^2 R$.\n\nWe compute the volume of the three-dimensional ball in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$.\nThe ball can be considered to be the solid of revolution generated by a\nhalf-disk. So we will need to know the centroid of the upper-half disk\n$B^2_+(r)$, radius $r$, in the plane. By symmetry, this centroid has\nonly a vertical component and no horizontal component. The vertical\ncomponent is calculated by: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\pi r^2/2} \\int_{B^2_+(r)} y \\, dx dy &= \n\\frac{r}{\\pi/2} \\int_{B^2_+(1)} y \\, dx dy \\\\\n&= \n\\frac{r}{\\pi/2} \\int_0^1 \\int_{-\\sqrt{1-y^2}}^{\\sqrt{1-y^2}} y \\, dx \\, dy \\\\\n&=\n\\frac{r}{\\pi/2} \\int_0^1 2y \\sqrt{1-y^2} \\, dy \\\\\n&=\n\\frac{4r}{3\\pi}\\,.\\end{aligned}$$ Then the volume of the ball of radius\n$r$ is\n$$V = \\left(\\frac{4r}{3\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\pi\\right) \\left( \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} r^3\\,.$$\n\nSimilarly we can compute the surface area of the sphere of radius $r$,\ngenerated by revolving a half-circular arc. The centroid of the upper\nhalf-circle $S^1_+(r)$ in the plane only has the vertical component:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\pi r} \\int_0^\\pi y \\, r dt = \\frac{1}{\\pi r} \\int_0^\\pi (r \\sin t) \\, r dt = \\frac{r}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin t \\, dt = \\frac{2r}{\\pi}\\,.$$\nThus the surface area of the sphere is given by\n$$A = \\left( \\frac{2r}{\\pi} \\cdot 2\\pi  \\right) \\pi r = 4\\pi r^2\\,.$$",
