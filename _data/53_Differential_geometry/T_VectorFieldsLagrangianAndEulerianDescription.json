  "definition": "When we deal with vector fields defined over a [*continuum*]{} media, a\nsuitable choice of coordinate systems becomes indispensable in produce\non the continuum and the subsequent physical behavior that such a\nmaterial media experiences. We shall discuss two possible methods that\nallow to approach the mentioned phenomena.\n\n**Some basic concepts and definitions**\n\nLet us consider a continuum embedded in an [*Euclidean vector space*]{}\n$(\\mathbb{R}^3,\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert)$. This continuum, alternatively called\n[*body*]{}, can be either deformable or undeformable. Let $\\Re_0$ be the\nregion initially accupied by the body and $\\Re$ any subsequently space\noccupied by that continuum. Each region of the Euclidean space filled by\nthe body shall be called [*configuration.*]{} In a system of coordinates\narbitrarily chosen, every particle of the body is identified in $\\Re_0$\nas a point $P_0$ of coordinates $(a,b,c)$, and let this point be carried\nover to a point $P$ in $\\Re$, being its coordinates $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$.\nThus, the transformation of all the points $(a,b,c)$ in $\\Re_0$ into the\npoints $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ in $\\Re$, indeed corresponds to a mapping which\nit can be expressed by $$\\begin{aligned}\nx_1=x_1(a,b,c), \\quad x_2=x_2(a,b,c), \\quad x_3=x_3(a,b,c),\\end{aligned}$$\nprovided $\\Re_0$ and $\\Re$ are subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and the mapping\nrepresented by $$x_i:\\Re_0 \\to \\Re, \\quad i = 1,\\,2,\\,3,$$ occupying the\nbody different regions or configurations in the space. The change of\nconfiguration that the body experiences we shall call it\n[*deformation.*]{} It is essential to understand that it is the body\nthat deforms, not the space the body occupies.\n\nLet us assume that Eq.(1) is a smooth continuous transformation (or\ndeformation) and it can be inverted to the equations $$\\begin{aligned}\na=a(x_1,x_2,x_3), \\quad b=b(x_1,x_2,x_3), \\quad c=c(x_1,x_2,x_3),\\end{aligned}$$\nthen the equations (1) and (2) define the continuum or body on study. So\nfar, we have introduced some basic concepts in to give a physical\ndescription of a continuum adopting different configurations as it\nexperiences a deformation. We shall now consider a more general and\nformal description.\n\n**Material and spatial coordinates**\n\nLet $X^\\alpha$ be the coordinates defining the points $P_0$ of a\ncontinuum initially located in the region $\\Re_0$ and let\n$G_{\\alpha\\beta}$ be the respective metric tensor. The $X^\\alpha$ are\ncalled [*material*]{} or [*Lagrangian*]{} coordinates which allow a\ndescription of the configuration $\\Re_0$. Analogously, let $x^i$ be the\ncoordinates defining the position of points $P$ in the configuration\n$\\Re$, once a deformation of body ocurrs, and let $g_{ij}$ be the\ncorrespondent metric tensor. The $x^i$ are called [*spatial*]{} or\n[*Eulerian*]{} coordinates which describe the space occupied for the\ncontinuum in the configuration $\\Re$. Thus, for instance, the squares of\nline elements in those regions $\\Re_0$ and $\\Re$ are given by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n dS_0^2=G_{\\alpha\\beta}dX^\\alpha dX^\\beta, \\quad ds^2=g_{ij}dx^i dx^j\\end{aligned}$$\nrespectively. Consequently, whereas the Lagrangian coordinates describe\nan initial configuration of the body in $\\Re_0$, the Eulerian\ncoordinates describe the region $\\Re$ of the space occupied by the\ncontinuum once the deformation takes place. That very general scheme, in\nwhich the choice of material system is independent of the choice of\nspatial coordinates, was introduced by Murnagham [@cite:Murnagham].\n\nIndeed those so-called descriptions are current erroneous German\nterminology, which refers as Lagrangian to the material coordinates that\nwere introduced by Euler [@cite:Euler] and spatial coordinates as\nEulerian that were introduced by D\u2019Alembert [@cite:D'Alembert].\n\nPossibly a more useful scheme is that introduced by Brillouin\n[@cite:Brillouin], as it allows a suitable definition of [*motion of a\ncontinuum.*]{} In that case a parameter is introduced (usually the time\n$t$) and the approach requires that metric tensors coincide, i.e.\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ng_{ij}(x^k)=G_{ij}(X^\\alpha(x^k,t)),\\end{aligned}$$ considering the\nmotion as a transformation of coordinates. (See the motion of continuum\nfor more details.)\n\nIt is relevant to mention that certain quantities which are relative\ninvariants in Brillouin\u2019s scheme, are absolute in Murnagham\u2019s. In\nparticular, if $\\rho_0$ is the density of the media in $\\Re_0$ and\n$\\rho$ in $\\Re$, considering the Jacobian of the transformation, we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_0=J\\rho.\\end{aligned}$$ With respect to the transformations of\neither spatial (Eulerian) or material (Lagrangian) alone, all of those\nquantities are absolute scalars, but if $\\rho$ is considered as the\ntransformed value of $\\rho_0$, then both values must be the densities in\nthe $x^i$ and $X^\\alpha$ systems, respectively, therefore showing a\nfundamental difference between the mentioned schemes.\n\n[1]{} F.
