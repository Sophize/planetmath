  "definition": "Summary. {#summary. .unnumbered}\n========\n\nThe term *curve* is associated with two closely related notions. The\nfirst notion is kinematic: a parameterized curve is a function of one\nreal variable taking values in some ambient geometric setting. This\nvariable can be interpreted as time, in which case the function\ndescribes the evolution of a moving particle. The second notion is\ngeometric; in this sense a curve is an arc, a 1-dimensional subset of an\nambient space. The two notions are related: the image of a parameterized\ncurve describes the trajectory of a moving particle. Conversely, a given\narc admits multiple parameterizations. A trajectory can be traversed by\nmoving particles at different speeds.\n\nIn algebraic geometry, the term curve is used to describe a\n1-dimensional variety relative to the complex numbers or some other\nground field. This can be potentially confusing, because a curve over\nthe complex numbers refers to an object which, in conventional geometry,\none would refer to as a surface. In particular, a Riemann surface can be\nregarded as as complex curve.\n\nKinematic definition {#kinematic-definition .unnumbered}\n====================\n\nLet $I\\subset {\\mathbb{R}}$ be an of the real line. A parameterized\ncurve is a continuous mapping $\\gamma:I\\to X$ taking values in a\ntopological space $X$. We say that $\\gamma$ is a *simple curve* if it\nhas no self-intersections, that is if the mapping $\\gamma$ is injective.\n\nWe say that $\\gamma$ is a *closed curve*, or a ** whenever $I=[a,b]$ is\na closed interval, and the endpoints are mapped to the same value;\n$\\gamma(a)=\\gamma(b).$ Equivalently, a loop may be defined to be a\ncontinuous mapping $\\gamma \\colon \\mathbb{S}^1\\to X$ whose domain\n$\\mathbb{S}^1$ is the unit circle. A simple closed curve is often called\na *Jordan curve*.\n\nIf $X=\\mathbb{R}^2$ then $\\gamma$ is called a *plane curve* or *planar\ncurve*.\n\nA smooth closed curve $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is *locally* if the\nlocal multiplicity of intersection of $\\gamma$ with each hyperplane at\nof each of the intersection points does not exceed $n$. The *global\nmultiplicity* is the sum of the local multiplicities. A simple smooth\ncurve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is called ** (or *globally* ) if the global\nmultiplicity of its intersection with any affine hyperplane is less than\nor equal to $n$. An example of a closed convex curve in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is the normalized generalized ellipse:\n$$(\\sin t, \\cos t, \\frac{\\sin 2t}{2}, \\frac{\\cos 2t}{2}, \\ldots , \\frac{\\sin nt}{n}, \\frac{\\cos nt}{n}).$$\nIn odd dimension there are no closed convex curves.\n\nIn many instances the ambient space $X$ is a differential manifold, in\nwhich case we can speak of differentiable curves. Let $I$ be an open\ninterval, and let $\\gamma:I\\to X$ be a differentiable curve. For every\n$t\\in I$ can regard the , $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, as the of a moving\nparticle, at time $t$. The velocity $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is a , which\nbelongs to $T_{\\gamma(t)} X$, the tangent space of the manifold $X$ at\nthe point $\\gamma(t)$. We say that a differentiable curve $\\gamma(t)$ is\n*regular*, if its velocity, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, is non-vanishing for all\n$t\\in I$.\n\nIt is also quite common to consider curves that take values in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. In this case, a parameterized curve can be regarded as\na vector-valued function $\\vec{\\gamma}:I \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, that is an\n$n$-tuple of functions $$\\vec{\\gamma}(t) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma_1(t)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma_n(t)\n\\end{pmatrix},$$ where $\\gamma_i:I\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$ are\nscalar-valued functions.\n\nGeometric definition. {#geometric-definition. .unnumbered}\n=====================\n\nA (non-singular) curve $C$, equivalently, an arc, is a connected,\n1-dimensional submanifold of a differential manifold $X$. This means\nthat for every point $p\\in C$ there exists an open neighbourhood\n$U\\subset X$ of $p$ and a chart $\\alpha:U\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ such that\n$$\\alpha(C\\cap U) = \\{ (t,0,\\ldots,0)\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n :\n-\\epsilon<t<\\epsilon\\}$$ for some real $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nAn alternative, but equivalent definition, describes an arc as the image\nof a regular parameterized curve. To accomplish this, we need to define\nthe notion of reparameterization. Let $I_1,I_2\\subset\n{\\mathbb{R}}$ be intervals. A reparameterization is a continuously\ndifferentiable function $$s:I_1\\to I_2$$ whose derivative is never\nvanishing. Thus, $s$ is either monotone increasing, or monotone\ndecreasing. Two regular, parameterized curves\n$$\\gamma_i:I_i\\to X,\\quad i=1,2$$ are said to be related by a\nreparameterization if there exists a reparameterization $s:I_1\\to I_2$\nsuch that $$\\gamma_1 = \\gamma_2\\circ s.$$ The inverse of a\nreparameterization function is also a reparameterization. Likewise, the\ncomposition of two parameterizations is again a reparameterization. Thus\nthe reparameterization relation between curves, is in fact an\nequivalence relation. An arc can now be defined as an equivalence class\nof regular, simple curves related by reparameterizations. In order to\nexclude pathological embeddings with wild endpoints we also impose the\ncondition that the arc, as a subset of $X$, be homeomorphic to an open\ninterval.",
