  "definition": "Let $M$ be a complex manifold with integrable $J$.\n\nSuppose $M$ is also a Riemannian manifold with metric tensor $g$ such\nthat $\\forall_{X,Y} g(X,Y) = g(JX,JY)$. We say that $g$ is an *Hermitian\nmetric tensor*.\n\nA differentiable manifold $M$ is said to be a *K\u00e4hler manifold* iff all\nthe following conditions are verified:\n\n-   $M$ is a complex manifold with complex structure $J$\n\n-   $M$ is a Riemannian manifold with an Hermitian metric $g$\n\n-   $J$ is covariantly constant with regard to the Levi-Civita\n    connection ($\\nabla J = 0$)\n\nK\u00e4hler manifolds are symplectic in a natural way with symplectic form\ndefined by $\\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$",
