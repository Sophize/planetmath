  "definition": "An *ellipse* that is centered at the origin is the curve in the plane\ndetermined by\n$$\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y}{b}\\right)^2 = 1,$$ where\n$a,b>0$.\n\nBelow is a graph of the ellipse\n$\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{x}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2=1$:\n\n(-3.2,-2.2)(3.5,2.5) (0,0)(-3.2,-2.2)(3.5,2.5) (0,0)(3,2)\n(3.5,-0.5)[$x$]{} (0,2.5)[$y$]{}\n\nThe *major axis* of an ellipse is the longest line segment whose\nendpoints are on the ellipse. The *minor axis* of an ellipse is the\nshortest line segment through the midpoint of the ellipse whose\nendpoints are on the ellipse.\n\nIn the first equation given above, if $a=b$, the ellipse reduces to a\ncircle of radius $a$, whereas if $a>b$ (as in the graph above), $a$ is\nsaid to be the [*major semi-axis*]{} length and $b$ the [*minor\nsemi-axis*]{} length; , the lengths of the major axis and minor axis are\n$2a$ and $2b$, respectively.\n\nMore generally, given any two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in the (Euclidean)\nplane and any real number $r$, let $E$ be the set of points $p$ having\nthe property that the sum of the distances from $p$ to $p_1$ and $p_2$\nis $r$; i.e.,\n$$E = \\left\\{ p\\, |\\, r=\\lvert p-p_1\\rvert + \\vert p-p_2\\rvert\\right\\}.$$\nIn terms of the geometric look of $E$, there are three possible\nscenarios for $E$: $E=\\varnothing$, $E=\\overline{p_1p_2}$, the line\nsegment with end-points $p_1$ and $p_2$, or $E$ is an ellipse. Points\n$p_1$ and $p_2$ are called *foci* of the ellipse; the line segments\nconnecting a point of the ellipse to the foci are the [*focal radii*]{}\nbelonging to that point. When $p_1=p_2$ and $r>0$, $E$ is a circle.\nUnder appropriate linear transformations (a translation followed by a\nrotation), $E$ has an algebraic appearance expressed in (1).\n\nIn polar coordinates, the ellipse is parametrized as $$\\begin{aligned}\n   x(t) &=& a\\cos t, \\\\\n   y(t) &=& b\\sin t,  \\quad t\\in[0,\\,2\\pi).\\end{aligned}$$ If $a>b$,\nthen $t$ is the [*eccentric anomaly*]{}; i.e., the polar angle of the\npoint on the circumscribed circle having the same abscissa as the point\nof the ellipse.\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n1.  If $a > b$, the foci of the ellipse (1) are on the $x$-axis with\n    distances $\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$ from the origin. The constant sum of the\n    of a point $p$ is equal to $2a$.\n\n2.  The normal line of the ellipse at its point $p$ halves the angle\n    between the focal radii drawn from $p$.\n\n3.  The area of an ellipse is $\\pi a b$. (See .)\n\n4.  The length of the perimeter of an ellipse can be expressed using an\n    elliptic integral.\n\n### Eccentricity {#eccentricity .unnumbered}\n\nBy definition, the [*eccentricity*]{} $\\epsilon$ ($0\\leq\\epsilon<1$) of\nthe ellipse is given by $$\\epsilon=\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{a}\\cdot$$ For\n$\\epsilon=0$, the ellipse reduces to a circle. Further,\n$b=a\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon^2}$, and by assuming that foci are located on\n$x$-axis, $p_1$ on $x<0$ and $p_2$ on $x>0$, then\n$|O-p_1|=|O-p_2|=\\epsilon a$, where $O(0,0)$ is the origin of the\nrectangular coordinate system.\n\n### Polar equation of the ellipse {#polar-equation-of-the-ellipse .unnumbered}\n\nBy translating the $y$-axis towards the focus $p_1$, we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx' &=& x+\\epsilon a,  \\\\\ny' &=& y,\\end{aligned}$$ but from (1) we get\n$$\\left(\\frac{x'-\\epsilon a}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y'}{b}\\right)^2 = 1.$$\nBy using the transformation equations to polar coordinates\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx' &=& r\\cos\\theta, \\\\\ny' &=& r\\sin\\theta,\\end{aligned}$$ and through (2) we arrive at the\npolar equation\n$$r(\\theta)=\\frac{(1-\\epsilon^2)a}{1-\\epsilon\\cos\\theta}\\cdot$$ This\nequation allows us to determine some additional properties about the\nellipse: $$\\begin{aligned}\nr_{max}:=r(0)=(1+\\epsilon)a, \\qquad \\text{which is called the {\\em aphelium}}; \\\\\nr_{min}:=r(\\pi)=(1-\\epsilon)a, \\qquad \\text{which is called the {\\em perihelium}}.\\end{aligned}$$\nHence, the general definition of the ellipse expressed above shows that\n$r_{min}+r_{max}=2a$ and also that the arithmetic mean\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{r_{min}+r_{max}}{2}=a$ corresponds to the major\nsemi-axis, while the geometric mean $\\sqrt{r_{min}r_{max}}=b$\ncorresponds to the minor semi-axis of the ellipse. Likewise, if\n$\\theta_\\epsilon$ is the angle between the [*polar axis*]{} $x'$ and the\nradial distance $|B-p_1|$, where $B(0,b)$ is the point of the ellipse\nover the $y$-axis, then we get the useful equation\n$\\cos\\theta_\\epsilon=\\epsilon$.",
