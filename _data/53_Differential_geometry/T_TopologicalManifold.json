  "definition": "The definition given in the manifold article is in fact the definition\nof topological manifold. If we change it to allow only smooth\n(differentiable) transition (maximal rank) functions, then we speak of a\nsmooth manifold. Or if we take real analytic function as the transition\nones we get $\\mathbb{R}$-analytic manifolds.\n\nOne must emphasize that the invariant number $n$ appearing in the\ndefinition there is the dimension of the manifold which is also the\ndimension of the tangent space at a point, in a smooth manifold.",
