  "definition": "A line $\\gamma$ on a surface $S$ is a [*line of curvature*]{} of $S$, if\nin every point of $\\gamma$ one of the principal sections has common\ntangent with $\\gamma$.\n\nBy the , a surface $F(x,\\,y,\\,z) = 0$, where $F$ has continuous first\nand partial derivatives, has two distinct families of lines of\ncurvature, which families are to each other.\n\nFor example, the meridian curves and the circles of latitude are the two\nfamilies of the lines of curvature on a surface of revolution.\n\nOn a developable surface, the other family of its curvature lines\nconsists of the generatrices of the surface.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for that the surface normals of a\nsurface $S$ set along a curve $c$ on $S$ would form a developable\nsurface, is that $c$ is a line of curvature of $S$.",
