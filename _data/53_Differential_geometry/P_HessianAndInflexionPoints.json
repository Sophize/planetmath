  "statement": "Suppose that $C$ is a curve in the real projective plane\n$\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb{P}^2$ given by a homogeneous equation $F(x,y,z) = 0$\nof $n$. If $F$ has continuous first derivatives in a neighborhood of a\npoint $P$ and the gradient of $F$ is non-zero at $P$ and $P$ is an\ninflection point of $C$, then $H(P) = 0$, where $H$ is the Hessian\ndeterminant: $$H = \\left| \\begin{matrix}\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x^2} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial z} \\\\\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y \\partial x} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y^2} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y \\partial z} \\\\\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial z \\partial x} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial z \\partial y} &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial z^2}\n \\end{matrix} \\right|$$\n\nWe may choose a system $x,y,z$ of homogenous coordinates such that the\npoint $P$ lies at $(0,0,1)$ and the equation of the tangent to $C$ at\n$P$ is $y = 0$. Using the implicit function theorem, we may conclude\nthat there exists an interval $(-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$ and a function\n$f \\colon (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n$F(t, f(t), 1) = 0$ when $-\\epsilon < t < \\epsilon$. In other words, the\nportion of curve near $P$ may be described in non-homogenous coordinates\nby $y = f(x)$. By the way the coordinates were chosen, $f(0) = 0$ and\n$f'(0) = 0$. Because $P$ is an inflection point, we also have\n$f''(0) = 0$.\n\nDifferentiating the equation $F(t, f(t), 1) = 0$ twice, we obtain the\nfollowing: $$\\begin{aligned}\n 0 = {d \\over dt} F(t, f(t), 1) &=\n   {\\partial F \\over \\partial x} (t, f(t), 1) +\n   f'(t) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (t, f(t), 1)\n\\\\\n 0 = {d^2 \\over dt^2} F(t, f(t), 1) &=\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x^2} (t, f(t), 1) +\n   f'(t) {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} (t, f(t), 1) \\\\ &\\quad+\n   \\left(f'(t)\\right)^2 {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y^2} (t, f(t), 1) +\n   f''(t) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (t, f(t), 1)\\end{aligned}$$ We\nwill now put $t=0$ but, for reasons which will be explained later, we do\nnot yet want to make use of the fact that $f''(0) = 0$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n {\\partial F \\over \\partial x} (0,0,1) &= 0 \\\\\n {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x^2} (0,0,1) &= \n -f''(0) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $F$ is homogenous, Euler\u2019s formula holds:\n$$x {\\partial F \\over \\partial x} +\n y {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} +\n z {\\partial F \\over \\partial z} = n F$$ Taking partial derivatives, we\nobtain the following: $$\\begin{aligned}\n x {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x^2} +\n y {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} +\n z {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial z} = \n (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial x} \\\\\n x {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} +\n y {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y^2} +\n z {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y \\partial z} = \n (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} \\\\\n x {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial z} +\n y {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y \\partial z} +\n z {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial z^2} = \n (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial z}\\end{aligned}$$ Evaluating at\n$(0,0,1)$ and making use of the equations deduced above, we obtain the\nfollowing: $$\\begin{aligned}\n {\\partial F \\over \\partial z} (0,0,1) &= 0 \\\\\n {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial z} (0,0,1) &= 0 \\\\\n {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial y \\partial z} (0,0,1) &= \n    (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) \\\\\n {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial z^2} (0,0,1) &= 0\\end{aligned}$$ Making\nuse of these facts, we may now evaluate the determinant:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n H (0,0,1) &= \\left| \\begin{matrix}\n   - f''(0) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} (0,0,1) &\n   0 \\\\\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial x \\partial y} (0,0,1) &\n   {\\partial^2 F \\over \\partial^2 y} (0,0,1) & \n   (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) \\\\\n   0 &\n   (n - 1) {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) &\n   0\n  \\end{matrix} \\right| \\\\ &=\n (n - 1)^2 \n \\left( {\\partial F \\over \\partial y} (0,0,1) \\right)^2\n f'' (0)\\end{aligned}$$ Since $P$ is an inflection point, $f''(0) = 0$,\nso we have $H(0,0,1) = 0$.\n\nActually, we proved slightly more than what was stated. Because the\ngradient is assumed not to vanish at $P$, but\n$\\partial F / \\partial x = 0$ and $\\partial F\n/ \\partial z = 0$ by the way we set up our coordinate system, we must\nhave $\\partial F / \\partial y \\neq 0$. Thus, we see that, if $n \\neq 1$,\nthen $H(0,0,1) = 0$ if and only if $f''(0)$. However, note that this\ndoes not mean that the Hessian vanishes if and only if $P$ is an\ninflection point since the definition of inflection point not only\nrequires that $f''(0) = 0$ but that the sign of $f''(t)$ change as $t$\npasses through $0$.\n\nThis result is used quite often in algebraic geometry, where $F$ is a\nhomogenous polynomial. In such a context, it is desirable to keep\ndemonstrations purely algebraic and avoid introducing analysis where\npossible, so a variant of this result is preferred. The theorem may be\nrestated as follows:\n\nSuppose that $C$ is a curve in the real projective plane\n$\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb{P}^2$ given by an equation $F(x,y,z) = 0$ where $F$\nis a homogenous polynomial of degree $n$. If $C$ is regular at a point\n$P$ and $P$ is an inflection point of $C$, then $H(P) = 0$, where $H$ is\nthe Hessian determinant.\n\nTo make our proof purely algebraic, we replace the use of the implicit\nfunction theorem to obtain $f$ with an expansion in a formal power\nseries. As above, we choose our $x,y,z$ coordinates so as to place $P$\nat $(0,0,1)$ and make $C$ tangent to the line $y=0$ at $P$. Then, since\n$P$ is a regular point of $C$, we may parameterize $C$ by a formal power\nseries $f(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k t^k$ such that $F(t,f(t),1) = 0$.\nThen, if we , we may proceed with the rest of the proof exactly as\nabove.",
