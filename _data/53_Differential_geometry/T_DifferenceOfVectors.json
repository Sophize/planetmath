  "definition": "Let $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ be two vectors in the plane (or in a vector\nspace). The [*difference vector*]{} or [*difference*]{}\n$\\vec{a}\\!-\\!\\vec{b}$ of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ is a vector $\\vec{d}$\nsuch that $$\\vec{b}+\\vec{d} = \\vec{a}.$$ Thus we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{b}+(\\vec{a}\\!-\\!\\vec{b}) = \\vec{a}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAccording to the procedure of forming the sum of vectors by setting the\naddends one after the other, the equation (1) tallies with the picture\nbelow; when the minuend and the subtrahend emanate from a common initial\npoint, their difference vector can be directed from the terminal point\nof the subtrahend to the terminal point of the minuend.\n\n(-2,-1)(4,2.5) (0,0) (0,0)(-1.5,2) (-1.5,2)(4,1) (0,0)(4,1)\n(2.1,0.2)[$\\vec{a}$]{} (-1,0.7)[$\\vec{b}$]{}\n(1.6,1.76)[$\\vec{a}\\!-\\!\\vec{b}$]{} (-2,-1)[.]{} (4,2.5)[.]{}\n\n**Remark.** It is easily seen that the difference $\\vec{a}\\!-\\!\\vec{b}$\nis same as the sum vector $$\\vec{a}\\!+\\!(-\\vec{b})$$ where $-\\vec{b}$ is\nthe [*opposite vector*]{} of $\\vec{b}$: it may be represented by the\ndirected line segment from the terminal point of $\\vec{b}$ to the\ninitial point of $\\vec{b}$.",
