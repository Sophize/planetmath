  "definition": "### Equation of a line {#equation-of-a-line .unnumbered}\n\nSuppose $a,b,c\\in {\\mathbbmss{R}}$. Then the set of points $(x,y)$ in\nthe plane that satisf[y]{} $$ax+by+c \\;=\\; 0,$$ where $a$ and $b$ can\nnot be both 0, is an (infinite) *line*.\n\nThe value of $y$ when $x=0$, if it exists, is called the\n*$y$-intercept*. Geometrically, if $d$ is the $y$-intercept, then\n$(0,d)$ is the point of intersection of the line and the $y$-axis. The\n$y$-intercept exists iff the line is not parallel to the $y$-axis. The\n*$x$-intercept* is defined similarly.\n\nIf $b\\neq0$, then the above equation of the line can be rewritten as\n$$y = mx + d.$$ This is called the *slope-intercept form* of a line,\nbecause both the slope and the $y$-intercept are easily identifiable in\nthe equation. The slope is $m$ and the $y$-intercept is $d$.\n\nThree finite points $(x_1,\\,y_1)$, $(x_2,\\,y_2)$, $(x_3,\\,y_3)$ in\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2$ are collinear if and only if the following\ndeterminant vanishes:\n$$\\left| \\begin{array}{ccc} x_1 & x_2 &x_3 \\\\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\\\ 1 & 1& 1\\end{array} \\right|=0.$$\nTherefore, the line through distinct points $(x_1,\\,y_1)$ and\n$(x_2,\\,y_2)$ has equation\n$$\\left| \\begin{array}{ccc} x_1 & x_2 &x \\\\ y_1 & y_2 & y \\\\ 1 & 1& 1\\end{array} \\right|=0,$$\nor more simply $$(y_1-y_2)x+(x_2 - x_1)y + y_2 x_1-x_2 y_1=0.$$\n\n### Line segment {#line-segment .unnumbered}\n\nLet $p_1 = (x_1,\\,y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2,\\,y_2)$ be distinct points in\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2$. The closed line segement generated by these points\nis the set\n$$\\{ p\\in {\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\mid   p=t p_1+(1-t) p_2,\\; 0\\leq t\\leq 1\\}.$$",
