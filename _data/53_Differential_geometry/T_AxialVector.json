  "definition": "Axial vector behaves like a vector (polar vector) except that it is\ninvariant under the inversion of its coordinate axes. For example, the\ncross product of two vectors $\\bold{A}$ and $\\bold{B}$,\n$$\\bold{A}\\times\\bold{B}$$ is an axial vector. The cross product of two\naxial vectors stays as an axial vector, whereas the cross product of an\naxial vector and a polar vector turns to be a polar vector.",
