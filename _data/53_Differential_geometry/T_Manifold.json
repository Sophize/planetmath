  "definition": "#### Summary.\n\nA [*manifold*]{} is a space that is locally like ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$,\nhowever lacking a preferred system of coordinates. Furthermore, a\nmanifold can have global topological properties, such as\nnon-contractible , that distinguish it from the topologically trivial\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$.\n\n#### Standard Definition.\n\nAn $n$-dimensional topological manifold $M$ is a second countable,\nHausdorff topological space[^1] that is locally homeomorphic to open\nsubsets of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$.\n\nA differential manifold is a topological manifold with some additional\nstructure information. A *chart*, also known as a *system of local\ncoordinates*, is a mapping $\\alpha: U \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, such that the\ndomain $U\\subset M$ is an open set, and such that $U$ is homeomorphic to\nthe image $\\alpha(U)$. Let\n$\\alpha: U_\\alpha \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{R}}^n,$ and\n$\\beta:U_\\beta\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^n$ be two charts with overlapping\n. The continuous injection $$\\beta\\circ\\alpha^{-1}: \\alpha(U_\\alpha\\cap\nU_\\beta)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^n$$ is called a *transition function*,\nand also called a *a change of coordinates*. An [*atlas*]{}\n${\\mathcal{A}}$ is a collection of charts\n$\\alpha:U_\\alpha\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose domains cover $M$, i.e.\n$$M = \\bigcup_{\\alpha} U_\\alpha.$$ Note that each transition function is\nreally just $n$ real-valued functions of $n$ real variables, and so we\ncan ask whether these are continuously differentiable. The atlas\n${\\mathcal{A}}$ defines a differential structure on $M$, if every\ntransition function is continuously differentiable.\n\nMore generally, for $k=1,2,\\ldots,\\infty,\\omega$, the atlas\n${\\mathcal{A}}$ is said to define a ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$ differential\nstructure, and $M$ is said to be of class ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$, if all the\ntransition functions are $k$-times continuously differentiable, or real\nanalytic in the case of ${\\mathcal{C}}^\\omega$. Two differential\nstructures of class ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$ on $M$ are said to be isomorphic\nif the union of the corresponding atlases is also a ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$\natlas, i.e. if all the new transition functions arising from the merger\nof the two atlases remain of class ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$. More generally,\ntwo ${\\mathcal{C}}^k$ manifolds $M$ and $N$ are said to be\ndiffeomorphic, i.e. have equivalent differential structure, if there\nexists a homeomorphism $\\phi:M\\to N$ such that the atlas of $M$ is\nequivalent to the atlas obtained as $\\phi$-pullbacks of charts on $N$.\n\nThe atlas allows us to define differentiable mappings to and from a\nmanifold. Let $$f:U\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}},\\quad U\\subset M$$ be a\ncontinuous function. For each $\\alpha\\in {\\mathcal{A}}$ we define\n$$f_\\alpha: V \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{R}},\\quad V\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^n,$$\ncalled the representation of $f$ relative to chart $\\alpha$, as the\nsuitably restricted composition $$f_\\alpha = f\\circ \\alpha^{-1}.$$ We\njudge $f$ to be differentiable if all the representations $f_\\alpha$ are\ndifferentiable. A path\n$$\\gamma: I\\rightarrow M,\\quad I\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}$$ is judged to be\ndifferentiable, if for all differentiable functions $f$, the suitably\nrestricted composition $f\\circ\\gamma$ is a differentiable function from\n${\\mathbb{R}}$ to ${\\mathbb{R}}$. Finally, given manifolds $M, N$, we\njudge a continuous mapping $\\phi:M\\rightarrow\nN$ between them to be differentiable if for all differentiable functions\n$f$ on $N$, the suitably restricted composition $f\\circ\\phi$ is a\ndifferentiable function on $M$.\n\n[^1]: For connected manifolds, the assumption that $M$ is\n    second-countable is logically equivalent to $M$ being paracompact,\n    or equivalently to $M$ being metrizable. The topological hypotheses\n    in the definition of a manifold are needed to exclude certain\n    counter-intuitive pathologies. Standard illustrations of these\n    pathologies are given by the [*long line*]{} (lack of\n    paracompactness) and the [*forked line*]{} (points cannot be\n    separated). These pathologies are fully described in Spivak. See .",
