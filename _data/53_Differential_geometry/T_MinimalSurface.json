  "definition": "Among the surfaces $F(x,\\,y,\\,z) = 0$, with $F$ twice continuously\ndifferentiable, a [*minimal surface*]{} is such that in every of its\npoints, the mean curvature vanishes. Because the mean curvature is the\narithmetic mean of the principal curvatures $\\varkappa_1$ and\n$\\varkappa_2$, the equation $$\\varkappa_2 \\;=\\; -\\varkappa_1$$ is valid\nin each point of a minimal surface.\n\nA minimal surface has also the property that every sufficiently little\nportion of it has smaller area than any other regular surface with the\nsame boundary curve.\n\nTrivially, a plane is a minimal surface. The catenoid is the only\nsurface of revolution which is also a minimal surface.",
