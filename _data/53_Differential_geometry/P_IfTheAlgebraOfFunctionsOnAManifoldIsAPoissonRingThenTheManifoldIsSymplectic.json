  "statement": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $A$ be the algebra of smooth\nfunctions from $M$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that there exists a bilinear\noperation $[,] \\colon A \\times A \\to A$ which makes $A$ a Poisson ring.\n\nFor this proof, we shall use the fact that $T^*(M)$ is the\nsheafification of the $A$-module generated by the set\n$\\{ df | f \\in A \\}$ modulo the relations\n\n-   $d(f+g) = df + dg$\n\n-   $dfg = g \\, df + f \\, dg$\n\nLet us define a map $\\omega \\colon T^*(M) \\to T(M)$ by the following\nconditions:\n\n-   $\\omega (df) (g) = [f,g]$ for all $fg \\in A$\n\n-   $\\omega (fX + gY) = f \\omega(X) + g \\omega(Y)$ for all $f,g \\in A$\n    and all $X,Y \\in T^*(M)$\n\nFor this map to be well-defined, it must respect the relations:\n$$\\omega (f+g)(h) = [f+g,h] = [f,h] + [g,h] = \\omega (f)(h) +  \\omega (g)(h)$$\n$$\\omega (fg)(h) = [fg,h] = f[g,h] + g[f,h] = f \\omega (g)(h) + g \\omega (g)(h)$$\nThese two equations show that $\\omega$ is a well-defined map from the\npresheaf hence, by general nonsense, a well defined map from the sheaf.\nThe fact that $\\omega (f \\, dg)$ is a derivation readily follows from\nthe fact that $[,]$ is a derivation in each slot.\n\nSince $[,]$ is non-degenerate, $\\omega$ is invertible. Denote its\ninverse by $\\Omega$. Since our manifold is finite-dimensional, we may\nnaturally regard $\\Omega$ as an element of $T^*(M) \\otimes T^*(M)$. The\nfact that $\\Omega$ is an antisymmetric tensor field (in other words, a\n2-form) follows from the fact that\n$\\Omega (df)(g) = [f,g] = -[g,f] = - \\Omega (dg)(f)$.\n\nFinally, we will use the Jacobi identity to show that $\\Omega$ is\nclosed. If $u,v,w \\in T(M)$ then, by a general identity of differential\ngeometry, $$\\langle d \\Omega, u \\wedge v \\wedge w \\rangle = \\langle u, d\n \\langle \\Omega, v \\wedge w \\rangle \\rangle + \\langle v, d \\langle\n \\Omega, w \\wedge u \\rangle \\rangle + \\langle w, d \\langle \\Omega, u\n \\wedge v \\rangle \\rangle$$ Since this identity is trilinear in $u,v,w$,\nwe can restrict attention to a generating set. Because of the\nnon-degeneracy assumption, vector fields of the form $ad_f$ where $f$ is\na function form such a set.\n\nBy the definition of $\\Omega$, we have $\\langle \\Omega, ad_f\n\\wedge ad_g \\rangle = [f,g]$. Then $\\langle ad_f, d\\,\n\\langle \\Omega, ad_g \\wedge ad_h \\rangle = [f,[g,h]]$ so the Jacobi\nidentity is satisfied.",
