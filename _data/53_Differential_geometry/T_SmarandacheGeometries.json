  "definition": "An axiom is said *smarandachely denied* (S-denied) if in the same space\nthe axiom behaves differently (i.e., validated and invalided; or only\ninvalidated but in at least two distinct ways).\n\nA *Smarandache geometry* (SG) is a geometry which has at least one\nsmarandachely denied axiom (1969).\n\nThus, as a particular case, Euclidean, Lobachevsky-Bolyai-Gauss, and\nRiemannian geometries may be united altogether, in the same space, by\nsome SGs. These last geometries can be partially Euclidean and partially\nnon-Euclidean.\n\nThe novelty of the SG is the fact that they introduce for the first time\n*the degree of negation in geometry*, similarly to the degree of\nfalsehood in fuzzy or neutrosophic logic. For example an axiom can be\ndenied in percentage of 30Also SG are defined on multispaces, i.e.\nunions of Euclidean and non-Euclidean subspaces, or unions of distinct\nnon-Euclidean spaces.\n\nAs an example of S-denying, a proposition $\\phi$, which is the\nconjunction of a set $\\phi_{i}$ of propositions, can be *invalidated in\nmany ways* if it is minimally unsatisfiable, that is, such that the\nconjunction of any proper subset of the $\\phi_{i}$ is satisfied in a\nstructure, but $\\phi$ itself is not.\n\nMany axioms have one of the following forms in the sequential logic: Let\n$n, m \\geqslant 1$ be two integers, also\n$A=A_1 \\times A_2 \\times \\cdots \\times A_{n}$ and\n$B=B_1 \\times B_2 \\times \\cdots \\times B_{m}$. Let\n$x = (x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_{n})$ and $y = (y_1, y_2, \\cdots, y_{m})$,\nalso $\\textit{P}(x)$ and $\\textit{Q}(x)$ be relationships on $x$ and\n$\\textit{R}(x, y)$ a relationship between $x$ and $y$. Then: $a_1$\n$\\forall x \\in A$, $\\exists$ and is unique $y \\in B$, such that\n$\\textit{R}(x, y)$. \u00a0$a_2$ If $x \\in A$ such that $\\textit{P}(x)$, then\n$\\textit{Q}(x)$. $a_3$ $\\forall x \\in A$ one has $\\textit{P}(x)$.\n\nOne can invalidate in many ways the first class of axioms $a_1$ as\nfollows: 1.1. $\\exists x \\in A$ and $\\exists$ finitely many (at least\ntwo) $y \\in B$ such that $\\textit{R}(x, y)$. 1.2. $\\exists x \\in A$ and\n$\\exists$ infinitely many $y \\in B$ such that $\\textit{R}(x, y)$. 1.3.\n$\\exists x \\in A$ such that $\\nexists y \\in B$ for which\n$\\textit{R}(x, y)$.\n\nOne can invalidate in many ways the second class of axioms $a_2$ as\nfollows: 2.1. $\\exists$ a unique $x \\in A$ such that $\\textit{P}(x)$ but\n$\\neg \\textit{Q}(x)$. 2.2. $\\exists$ finitely many (more than one)\n$x \\in A$ such that $\\textit{P}(x)$ but $\\neg \\textit{Q}(x)$. 2.3.\n$\\exists$ infinitely many $x \\in A$ such that $\\textit{P}(x)$ but\n$\\neg \\textit{Q}(x)$. 2.4. $\\forall x \\in A$ such that $\\textit{P}(x)$\none has $\\neg \\textit{Q}(x)$.\n\nOne can invalidate in many ways the third class of axioms $a_3$ as\nfollows: 3.1. $\\exists x \\in A$ and is unique such that\n$\\neg \\textit{P}(x)$. 3.2. $\\exists$ finitely many $x \\in A$ such that\n$\\neg \\textit{P}(x)$. 3.3. $\\exists$ infinitely many $x \\in A$ such that\n$\\neg \\textit{P}(x)$.\n\nNot all axioms can be smarandachely denied.\n\nHere it is an example of what it means for *an axiom to be invalidated\nin multiple ways* $[2]$: As a particular axiom let\u2019s take Euclid\u2019s Fifth\nPostulate. In Euclidean or parabolic geometry a line has one parallel\nonly through a given point. In Lobacevskian or hyperbolic geometry a\nline has at least two parallels through a given point. In Riemannian or\nelliptic geometry a line has no parallel through a given point. Whereas\nin Smarandache geometries there are lines which have no parallels\nthrough a given point and other lines which have one or more parallels\nthrough a given point (the fifth postulate is invalidated in many ways).\n\nTherefore, the Euclid\u2019s Fifth Postulate (which asserts that there is\nonly one parallel passing through an exterior point to a given line) can\nbe invalidated in many ways, i.e. *Smarandachely denied*, as follows:\n\n- first invalidation: there is no parallel passing through an exterior\npoint to a given line;\n\n- second invalidation: there is a finite number of parallels passing\nthrough an exterior point to a given line;\n\n- third invalidation: there are infinitely many parallels passing\nthrough an exterior point to a given line.\n\n[6]{} S.
