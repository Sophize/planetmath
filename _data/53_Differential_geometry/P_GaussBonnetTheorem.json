  "statement": "(Carl Friedrich Gauss and Pierre Ossian Bonnet) Given a two-dimensional\ncompact Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary, Gaussian curvature of\npoints $G$ and geodesic curvature of points $g_x$ on the boundary\n$\\partial M$, it is the case that\n$$\\int_M G \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M}g_x ds = 2\\pi\\chi(M),$$ where\n$\\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of the manifold, $dA$ denotes the\nmeasure with respect to area, and $ds$ denotes the measure with respect\nto arclength on the boundary. This theorem expresses a topological\ninvariant in terms of geometrical information.",
