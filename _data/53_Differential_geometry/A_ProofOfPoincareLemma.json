  "argumentText": "Let $X$ be a smooth manifold, and let $\\omega$ be a closed differential\nform of degree $k>0$ on $X$. For any $x\\in X$, there exists a\ncontractible neighbourhood $U\\subset X$ of $x$ (i.e. $U$ is homotopy\nequivalent to a single point), with inclusion map\n$$\\iota\\colon U\\hookrightarrow X.$$ To construct such a neighbourhood,\ntake for example an open ball in a coordinate chart around $x$. Because\nof the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology, the $k$th de Rham\ncohomology group ${\\rm H}^k(U)$ is isomorphic to that of a point; in\nparticular, $${\\rm H}^k(U)=0\\quad\\hbox{for all $k>0$}.$$ Since\n$d(\\iota^*\\omega)=\\iota^*(d\\omega)=0$, this implies that there exists a\n$(k-1)$-form $\\eta$ on $U$ such that $d\\eta=\\iota^*\\omega$. In the case\nwhere $X$ is a contractible manifold, such an $\\eta$ exists globally\nsince we can choose $U=X$ above.",
