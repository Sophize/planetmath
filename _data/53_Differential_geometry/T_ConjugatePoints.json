  "definition": "Let $M$ be a manifold on which a notion of geodesic is defined. (For\ninstance, $M$ could be a Riemannian manifold, $M$ could be a manifold\nwith affine connection, or $M$ could be a Finsler space.)\n\nTwo distinct points, $P$ and $Q$ of $M$ are said to be conjugate points\nif there exist two or more distinct geodesic segments having $P$ and $Q$\nas endpoints.\n\nA simple example of conjugate points are the north and south poles of a\nsphere (endowed with the usual metric of constant curvature) \u2014 every\nmeridian is a geodesic segment having the poles as endpoints.",
