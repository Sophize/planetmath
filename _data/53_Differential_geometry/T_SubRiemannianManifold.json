  "definition": "A *Sub-Riemannian* manifold is a triple\n$(M,\\mathcal{H},g_{\\mathcal{H}})$ where $M$ is a manifold, $\\mathcal{H}$\nis a distribution (that is, a linear subbundle of the tangent bundle\n$TM$ of $M$), and $g_{\\mathcal{H}}$ is a metric on $\\mathcal{H}$ induced\nby a fiber inner product on $\\mathcal{H}$. The distribution\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is often referred to as the *horizontal* distribution.",
