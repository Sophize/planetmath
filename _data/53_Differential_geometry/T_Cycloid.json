  "definition": "A *cycloid* is a curve that a point on the perimeter of a wheel when\nrolling along the $x$-axis without slipping. If the radius of the\nrolling wheel is $a$, then the cycloid may be presented in the\nparametric form $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\;=\\; a(\\varphi-\\sin\\varphi),\\\\\ny \\;=\\; a(1-\\cos\\varphi),\n\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\varphi$ expresses the angle rotated\nby the wheel around its .\n\nIn what follows, a blue curve indicates a cycloid (or a portion thereof)\nand red line segments indicate radii of the wheel.\n\nBelow is a picture of the wheel on the $x$-axis with $\\varphi = 0$.\n\n(-1,0)(1,2) (0,1)[1]{} (0,0)(0,1) (-1,0)(1,0) (1,-0.3)[$x$]{} (0,0)(0,1)\n(-1,0)[.]{} (0,2)[.]{}\n\nAs the wheel rolls, $\\varphi$ increases.
