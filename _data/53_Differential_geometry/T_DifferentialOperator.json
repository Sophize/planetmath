  "definition": "Roughly speaking, a [*differential operator*]{} is a mapping, typically\nunderstood to be linear, that transforms a function into another\nfunction by means of partial derivatives and multiplication by other\nfunctions.\n\nOn ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, a differential operator is commonly understood to\nbe a linear transformation of ${\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}({\\mathbb{R}}^n)$\nhaving the form $$f \\mapsto \\sum_{I} a^I f_I,\\quad f\\in\n{\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}({\\mathbb{R}}^n),$$ where the sum is taken over a\nfinite number of multi-indices $I=(i^1,\\ldots,i^n)\\in {\\mathbb{N}}^n$,\nwhere $a^I\\in\n{\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}({\\mathbb{R}}^n)$, and where $f_I$ denotes a partial\nderivative of $f$ taken $i_1$ times with respect to the first variable,\n$i_2$ times with respect to the second variable, etc. The [*order*]{} of\nthe operator is the maximum number of derivatives taken in the above\nformula, i.e. the maximum of $i_1+\\ldots+i_n$ taken over all the $I$\ninvolved in the above summation.\n\nOn a ${\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}$ manifold $M$, a differential operator is\ncommonly understood to be a linear transformation of\n${\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}(M)$ having the above form relative to some system\nof coordinates. Alternatively, one can equip ${\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}(M)$\nwith the limit-order topology, and define a differential operator as a\ncontinuous transformation of ${\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}(M)$.\n\nThe order of a differential operator is a more subtle notion on a\nmanifold than on ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. There are two complications. First,\none would like a definition that is independent of any particular system\nof coordinates. Furthermore, the order of an operator is at best a local\nconcept: it can change from point to point, and indeed be unbounded if\nthe manifold is non-compact. To address these issues, for a differential\noperator $T$ and $x\\in M$, we define\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}_x(T)$ the order of $T$ at $x$, to be\nthe smallest $k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $$T[f^{k+1}](x) = 0$$ for all\n$f\\in{\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}(M)$ such that $f(x)=0$. For a fixed\ndifferential operator $T$, the function\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}(T):M\\rightarrow\n{\\mathbb{N}}$ defined by\n$$x\\mapsto {\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}_x(T)$$ is lower\nsemi-continuous, meaning that\n$${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}_y(T)\\geq {\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}_x(T)$$\nfor all $y\\in M$ sufficiently close to $x$.\n\nThe global order of $T$ is defined to be the maximum of\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ord}}\\nolimits}_x(T)$ taken over all $x\\in M$. This\nmaximum may not exist if $M$ is non-compact, in which case one says that\nthe order of $T$ is infinite.\n\nLet us conclude by making two remarks. The notion of a differential\noperator can be generalized even further by allowing the operator to act\non sections of a bundle.\n\nA differential operator $T$ is a local operator, meaning that\n$$T[f](x) = T[g](x),\\quad f,g\\in{\\mathcal{C}^\\infty}(M),\\; x\\in M,$$ if\n$f\\equiv g$ in some neighborhood of $x$. A theorem, proved by Peetre\nstates that the converse is also true, namely that every local operator\nis necessarily a differential operator.\n\n1.
