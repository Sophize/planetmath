In formal logic, differential logic treats the\nprinciples that govern the use of a **differential logical calculus**,\nthat is, a formal system with the expressive capacity to describe change\nand diversity in logical universes of discourse.\n\nA simple example of a differential logical calculus is furnished by a .\nThis extends an ordinary in the same way that extends analytic geometry.\n\nReadings\n========\n\n-   Awbrey, J., \u201c\".\n\n-   Awbrey, J., \u201c\".",
