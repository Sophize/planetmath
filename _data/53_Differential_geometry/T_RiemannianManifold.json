  "definition": "A [*Riemannian metric tensor*]{} is a covariant, type $(0,2)$ tensor\nfield $g\\in\\Gamma({\\operatorname{T}}^* M\\otimes {\\operatorname{T}}^*M)$\nsuch that at each point $p\\in M$, the bilinear form\n$g_p:{\\operatorname{T}}_pM\\times {\\operatorname{T}}_p M\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$\nis symmetric and positive definite. Here $T^* M$ is the cotangent bundle\nof $M$ (defined as a sheaf), $\\Gamma$ is the set of global sections of\n$T^* M \\otimes T^* M$, and $g_p$ is the value of the function $g$ at the\npoint $p \\in M$.\n\nLet $(x^1,\\ldots,x^n)$ be a system of local coordinates on an open\nsubset $U\\subset M$, let $dx^i,\\; i=1,\\ldots, n$ be the corresponding\ncoframe of 1-forms, and let\n$\\displaystyle {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial  x^{i}}},\\; i=1,\\ldots, n$ be\nthe corresponding dual frame of vector fields. Using the local\ncoordinates, the metric tensor has the unique expression\n$$g=\\sum_{i,j=1}^n g_{ij}\\, dx^i\\otimes dx^j,$$ where the metric tensor\ncomponents\n$$g_{ij}=g\\left({\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial  x^{i}}},{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial  x^{j}}}\\right)$$\nare smooth functions on $U$.\n\nOnce we fix the local coordinates, the functions $g_{ij}$ completely\ndetermine the Riemannian metric. Thus, at each point $p\\in U$, the\nmatrix $(g_{ij}(p))$ is symmetric, and positive definite. Indeed, it is\npossible to define a Riemannian structure on a manifold $M$ by\nspecifying an atlas over $M$ together with a matrix of functions\n$g_{ij}$ on each coordinate chart which are symmetric and positive\ndefinite, with the proviso that the $g_{ij}$\u2019s must be compatible with\neach other on overlaps.\n\nA manifold $M$ together with a Riemannian metric tensor $g$ is called a\n[*Riemannian manifold*]{}.\n\n[**Note:**]{} A Riemannian metric tensor on $M$ is not a distance metric\non $M$. However, on a connected manifold every Riemannian metric tensor\non $M$ induces a distance metric on $M$, given by $$d(x,y) :=\n\\inf \\left\\{ \\int_0^1 \\left[g\\!\\!\\left( \\frac{dc}{dt},\n      \\frac{dc}{dt}\\right)_{\\!c(t)}\\right]^{1/2}dt \\right\\} ,\\quad\nx,y\\in M,$$ where the infimum is taken over all rectifiable curves\n$c:[0,1]\\to M$ with $c(0)=x$ and $c(1)=y$.\n\nOften, it is the $g_{ij}$ that are referred to as the \u201cRiemannian\nmetric\u201d. This, however, is a misnomer. Properly speaking, the $g_{ij}$\nshould be called local coordinate components of a metric tensor, where\nas \u201cRiemannian metric\u201d should refer to the distance function defined\nabove. However, the practice of calling the collection of $g_{ij}$\u2019s by\nthe misnomer \u201cRiemannian metric\u201d appears to have stuck.\n\n**Remarks:**\n\n-   Both the Riemannian manifold and Riemannian metric tensor are\n    fundamental concepts in Einstein\u2019s General Relativity (GR) theory\n    where the \u201cRiemannian metric\u201d and curvature of the physical\n    Riemannian space-time are changed by the presence of massive bodies\n    and energy according to .\n\n-   The category of Riemannian manifolds (or \u2018spaces\u2019) provides an\n    alternative framework for GR theories as well as algebraic quantum\n    field theories (AQFTs);\n\n-   The category of \u2018pseudo-Riemannian\u2019 manifolds, deals in fact with\n    extensions of Minkowski spaces, does not possess the Riemannian\n    metric defined in this entry on Riemannian manifolds, and is claimed\n    as a useful approach to defining 4D-spacetimes in relativity\n    theories.",
