  "definition": "Let $I\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}$ be an interval, and let\n$\\gamma:I\\to{\\mathbb{R}}^3$ be an arclength parameterization of an\noriented space curve, assumed to be regular, and free of points of\ninflection. We interpret $\\gamma(t)$ as the trajectory of a particle\nmoving through 3-dimensional space. Let $T(t), N(t), B(t)$ denote the\ncorresponding moving trihedron. The speed of this particle is given by\n$$v(t) = \\Vert \\gamma'(t) \\Vert.$$\n\nThe quantity $$\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\Vert T'(t)\\Vert}{v(t)} = \n               \\frac{\\Vert \\gamma'(t)\\times \\gamma''(t)\\Vert}\n                     {\\Vert \\gamma'(t)\\Vert^3}$$ is called the\n*curvature* of the space curve. It is invariant with respect to\nreparameterization, and is therefore a measure of an intrinsic property\nof the curve, a real number geometrically assigned to the point\n$\\gamma(t)$. If one parameterizes the curve with respect to the\narclength $s$, one gets the more concise relation that\n$$\\kappa(s) = \\frac{1\\cdot\\Vert\\gamma''(s)\\Vert\\cdot\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{1^3} \n             = \\Vert\\gamma''(s)\\Vert.$$\n\nPhysically, curvature may be conceived as the ratio of the normal\nacceleration of a particle to the particle\u2019s speed. This ratio measures\nthe degree to which the curve deviates from the straight line at a\nparticular point. Indeed, one can show that of all the circles passing\nthrough $\\gamma(t)$ and lying on the osculating plane, the one of radius\n$1/\\kappa(t)$ serves as the best approximation to the space curve at the\npoint $\\gamma(t)$.\n\nTo treat curvature analytically, we take the derivative of the relation\n$$\\gamma'(t) = v(t) T(t).$$ This yields the following decomposition of\nthe acceleration vector: $$\\gamma''(t) = v'(t) T(t) + v(t) T'(t)\n              = v(t) \\left\\{ (\\log v)'(t)\\, T(t) + \\kappa(t)\\, N(t)\\right\\}.$$\nThus, to change speed, one needs to apply acceleration along the tangent\nvector; to change heading the acceleration must be applied along the\nnormal.",
