  "definition": "The notion of a derivative has numerous interpretations and\napplications. A well-known geometric interpretation is that of a slope,\nor more generally that of a linear approximation to a mapping between\nlinear spaces (see ). Another useful interpretation comes from physics\nand is based on the idea of related rates. This second point of view is\nquite general, and sheds light on the definition of the derivative of a\nmanifold mapping (the latter is described in the pushforward entry).\n\nConsider two physical quantities $x$ and $y$ that are somehow coupled.\nFor example:\n\n-   the quantities $x$ and $y$ could be the coordinates of a point as it\n    moves along the unit circle;\n\n-   the quantity $x$ could be the radius of a sphere and $y$ the\n    sphere\u2019s surface area;\n\n-   the quantity $x$ could be the horizontal position of a point on a\n    given curve and $y$ the distance traversed by that point as it moves\n    from some fixed starting position;\n\n-   the quantity $x$ could be depth of water in a conical tank and $y$\n    the rate at which the water flows out the bottom.\n\nRegardless of the application, the situation is such that a change in\nthe value of one quantity is accompanied by a change in the value of the\nother quantity. So let\u2019s imagine that we take control of one of the\nquantities, say $x$, and change it in any way we like. As we do so,\nquantity $y$ follows suit and changes along with $x$. Now the analytical\nrelation between the values of $x$ and $y$ could be quite complicated\nand non-linear, but the relation between the instantaneous rates of\nchange of $x$ and $y$ [*is linear*]{}.\n\nIt does not matter how we vary the two quantities, the ratio of the\nrates of change depends only on the values of $x$ and $y$. This ratio\nis, of course, the derivative of the function that maps the values of\n$x$ to the values of $y$. Letting $\\dot{x}, \\dot{y}$ denote the rates of\nchange of the two quantities, we describe this conception of the\nderivative as $$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\dot{y}}{\\dot{x}},$$ or\nequivalently as $$\\label{eq:deriv}\n  \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\,  \\dot{x}.$$\n\nNext, let us generalize the discussion and suppose that the two\nquantities ${\\mathbf{x}}$ and ${\\mathbf{y}}$ represent physical states\nwith multiple degrees of freedom. For example, ${\\mathbf{x}}$ could be a\npoint on the earth\u2019s surface, and ${\\mathbf{y}}$ the position of a point\n1 kilometer to the north of ${\\mathbf{x}}$. Again, the dependence of\n${\\mathbf{y}}$ and ${\\mathbf{x}}$ is, in general, non-linear, but the\nrate of change of ${\\mathbf{y}}$ does have a linear dependence on the\nrate of change of ${\\mathbf{x}}$. We would like to say that the\nderivative is precisely this linear relation, but we must first contend\nwith the following complication. The rates of change are no longer\nscalars, but rather velocity vectors, and therefore the derivative must\nbe regarded as a linear transformation that changes one vector into\nanother.\n\nIn order to formalize this generalized notion of the derivative we must\nconsider ${\\mathbf{x}}$ and ${\\mathbf{y}}$ to be points on manifolds $X$\nand $Y$, and the relation between them a manifold mapping\n$\\phi:X\\rightarrow\nY$. A varying ${\\mathbf{x}}$ is formally described by a parameterized\ncurve $$\\gamma:I\\rightarrow X,\\quad I\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}.$$ The\ncorresponding velocities take their value in the tangent spaces of $X$:\n$$\\gamma'(t) \\in {\\mathrm{T}}_{\\gamma(t)} X.$$ The \u201ccoupling\u201d of the two\nquantities is described by the composition\n$$\\phi\\circ\\gamma:I\\rightarrow Y.$$ The derivative of $\\phi$ at any\ngiven ${\\mathbf{x}}\\in X$ is a linear mapping\n$$\\phi_*({\\mathbf{x}}): {\\mathrm{T}}_{{\\mathbf{x}}} X \\rightarrow {\\mathrm{T}}_{\\phi({\\mathbf{x}})} Y,$$\ncalled the pushforward of $\\phi$ at ${\\mathbf{x}}$, with the property\nthat for every trajectory $\\gamma$ passing through ${\\mathbf{x}}$ at\ntime $t$, we have\n$$(\\phi\\circ\\gamma)'(t) = \\phi_*({\\mathbf{x}})\\gamma'(t).$$ The above is\nthe multi-dimensional and coordinate-free generalization of the related\nrates relation .\n\nAll of the above has a perfectly rigorous presentation in terms of\nmanifold theory. The approach of the present entry is more informal; our\nambition was merely to motivate the notion of a derivative by describing\nit as a linear transformation between velocity vectors.",
