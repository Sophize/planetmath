  "definition": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\\alpha$ a one form on $M$. Then\n$\\alpha$ is a *contact form* on $M$ if\n\n1.  for each point $m \\in M$, $\\alpha_{m} \\neq 0$ and\n\n2.  the restriction $d\\alpha_{m}|_{\\ker{\\alpha_{m}}}$ of the\n    differential of $\\alpha$ is nondegenerate.\n\nCondition 1 ensures that $\\xi=\\ker{\\alpha}$ is a subbundle of the vector\nbundle $TM$. Condition 2 equivalently says $d\\alpha$ is a symplectic\nstructure on the vector bundle $\\xi \\to M$. A *contact structure* $\\xi$\non a manifold $M$ is a subbundle of $TM$ so that for each $m \\in M$,\nthere is a contact form $\\alpha$ defined on some neighborhood of $m$ so\nthat $\\xi = \\ker{\\alpha}$. A co-oriented contact structure is a\nsubbundle of $TM$ of the form $\\xi=\\ker{\\alpha}$ for some globally\ndefined contact form $\\alpha$.\n\nA (co-oriented) *contact manifold* is a pair $(M,\\xi)$ where $M$ is a\nmanifold and $\\xi$ is a (co-oriented) contact structure. Note,\nsymplectic linear algebra implies that $\\dim{M}$ is odd. If\n$\\dim{M} = 2n+1$ for some positive integer $n$, then a one form $\\alpha$\nis a contact form if and only if $\\alpha \\wedge (d\\alpha)^{n}$ is\neverywhere nonzero.\n\nSuppose now that $(M_1,\\xi_1=\\ker{\\alpha_1})$ and\n$(M_2,\\xi_2=\\ker{\\alpha_2})$ are co-oriented contact manifolds. A\ndiffeomorphism $\\phi:M_1 \\to M_2$ is called a *contactomorphism* if the\npullback along $\\phi$ of $\\alpha_2$ differs from $\\alpha_1$ by some\npositive smooth function $f:M_1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, that is,\n$\\phi^{*}\\alpha_{2} = f\\alpha_{1}$.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n1.  $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a contact manifold with the contact structure\n    induced by the one form $\\alpha = dz + xdy$.\n\n2.  Denote by $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ the two-torus\n    $\\mathbb{T}^{2} = S^1 \\times S^1$. Then,\n    $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}^2$ (with coordinates\n    $t,\\theta_1,\\theta_2$) is a contact manifold with the contact\n    structure induced by $\\alpha = \\cos{t\\theta_1}+\\sin{t\\theta_2}$.",
