  "definition": "Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold (at least two times differentiable)\nwith affine connection $\\nabla$. The solution to the equation\n$$\\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma}\\dot{\\gamma}=0$$ defined in the interval $[0,a]$,\nis called a *geodesic* or a *geodesic curve*. It can be shown that if\n$\\nabla$ is a Levi-Civita connection and $a$ is \u2018small enough\u2019, then the\ncurve $\\gamma$ is the shortest possible curve between the points\n$\\gamma(0)$ and $\\gamma(a)$, and is often referred to as a *minimizing\ngeodesic* between these points.\n\nConversely, any curve which minimizes the between two arbitrary points\nin a manifold, is a geodesic.\n\nexamples of geodesics includes straight lines in Euclidean space\n($\\mathbb{R}^n$) and great circles on spheres (such as the equator of\nearth). The latter of which is not minimizing if the geodesic from the\npoint $p$ is extended beyond its antipodal point. This example also\npoints out to us that between any two points there may be more than one\ngeodesic. In fact, between a point and its antipodal point on the\nsphere, there are an infinite number of geodesics. Given a $p$, it is\nalso a property for a point $q$ (known as a *focal point* of $p$) where\ndifferent geodesics issuing from $p$ intersects, to be the point where\nany given geodesic from $p$ ceases to be minimizing.\n\n#### Coordinates\n\nIn coordinates the equation is given by the system\n$$\\frac{d^2x_k}{dt^2}+\\sum_{i,j}\\Gamma^k_{ij}\\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\frac{dx_j}{dt}=0 \\qquad 1\\leq k \\leq n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ is the Christoffel symbols (see entry about\nconnection), $t$ is the parameter of the curve and\n$\\{x_1, \\ldots , x_n\\}$ are coordinates on $M$.\n\nThe formula follows since if\n$\\displaystyle {\\dot{\\gamma}}= \\sum_i\\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\partial_{x_i}$,\nwhere $\\{\\partial_{x_1}, \\ldots , \\partial_{x_n}\\}$ are the\ncorresponding coordinate vectors, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}{\\dot{\\gamma}}&= \\nabla_{\\sum_i\\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\partial_{x_i}}{\\sum_j\\frac{dx_j}{dt}\\partial_{x_j}}\\\\\n&=\\sum_k\\dot{\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{dx_k}{dt}\\right)\\partial_{x_k}+ \\sum_{i,j}\\frac{dx_j}{dt}\\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\nabla_{\\partial_{x_i}}\\partial_{x_j} \\\\\n&=\\sum_k\\left( \\frac{d^2x_k}{dt^2}+\\sum_{i,j} \\frac{dx_i}{dt}\\frac{dx_j}{dt}\\Gamma^k_{ij}\\right)\\partial_{x_k}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n#### Metric spaces\n\nA geodesic in a metric space $(X,d)$ is simply a continuous\n$f:[0,a]\\to X$ such that the of $f$ is $a$. Of course, the may be\ninfinite. A geodesic metric space is a metric space where the distance\nbetween two points may be realized by a geodesic.",
