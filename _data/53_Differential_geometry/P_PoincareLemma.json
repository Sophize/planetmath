If $H^k(X)=0$, then every $k$ form is exact, but if $H^k(X)$ is\nnon-zero, then $X$ has a non-trivial topology (or \u201choles\u201d) such that\n$k$-forms are not globally exact. For instance, in\n$X={\\mathbb{R}}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with polar coordinates $(r,\\phi)$, the\n$1$-form $\\omega=d\\phi$ is not globally exact.\n\n[9]{} L.
