  "definition": "A locally Euclidean space $X$ is a topological space that locally\n\u201clooks\u201d like ${\\mathbbmss{R}}^n$. This makes it possible to talk about\ncoordinate axes around $X$. It also gives some topological structure to\nthe space: for example, since ${\\mathbbmss{R}}^n$ is locally compact, so\nis $X$. However, the restriction does not induce any geometry onto $X$.\n\nSuppose $X$ is a topological space. Then $X$ is called *locally\nEuclidean* if for each $x\\in X$ there is a neighbourhood $U\\subseteq X$,\na $V\\subseteq {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, and a homeomorphism $\\phi: U\\to V$. Then\nthe triple $(U,\\phi, n)$ is called a *chart* for $X$.\n\nHere, ${\\mathbb{R}}$ is the set of real numbers, and for $n=0$ we define\n${\\mathbb{R}}^0$ as set with a single point equipped with the discrete\ntopology.\n\n### Local dimension {#local-dimension .unnumbered}\n\nSuppose $X$ is a locally Euclidean space with $x\\in X$. Further, suppose\n$(U,\\phi, n)$ is a chart of $X$ such that $x\\in U$. Then we define the\n*local* of $X$ at $x$ is $n$. This is well defined, that is, the local\ndimension does not depend on the chosen chart. If $(U',\\phi', n')$ is\nanother chart with $x\\in U'$, then\n$\\psi\\circ \\phi^{-1}: \\phi(U\\cap U') \\to \\psi(U\\cap U')$ is a\nhomeomorphism between $\\phi(U\\cap U')\\subseteq {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and\n$\\psi(U\\cap U')\\subseteq {\\mathbb{R}}^{n'}$. By Brouwer\u2019s theorem for\nthe invariance of dimension (which is nontrivial), it follows that\n$n=n'$.\n\nIf the local dimension is constant, say $n$, we say that the dimension\nof $X$ is $n$, and write $\\dim X = n$.\n\n### Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n\n-   Any set with the discrete topology, is a locally Euclidean of\n    dimension $0.$\n\n-   Any open subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is locally Euclidean.\n\n-   Any manifold is locally Euclidean. For example, using a\n    stereographic projection, one can show that the sphere $S^n$ is\n    locally Euclidean.\n\n-   The long line is locally Euclidean of dimension one. Note that the\n    long line is not Hausforff. [@conlon].\n\n### Notes {#notes .unnumbered}\n\nThe concept locally Euclidean has a different meaning in the setting of\nRiemannian manifolds.\n\n[9]{} L.
