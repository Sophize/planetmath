  "definition": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A *moving frame* (sometimes just a\n*frame*) on $M$ is a choice, for every $P\\in M$, of a basis for the\ntangent space $T_pM$ to $M$ at $P$. More formally (and abstractly), a\nframe is a (smooth) section of the principal bundle for\n$\\operatorname{GL}_n$ over $M$.\n\nExamples and Remarks {#examples-and-remarks .unnumbered}\n--------------------\n\n-   If $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$, then any basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ trivially\n    gives a frame as well.\n\n-   A more interesting example (and perhaps a source for the definition)\n    is when $M=\\mathbb{R}^2-\\{(0,0)\\},$ and we take the vectors\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$\n    at a point $(r,\\theta)$. Note that this frame cannot be extended to\n    a smooth frame on all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n-   Similar to the previous example, one can show that the 2-sphere\n    admits no frames. A manifold which admits a (global) frame is called\n    *parallelizable.*\n\n-   A key example of a frame is the Frenet frame.\n\n-   One places adjective in front of \u201cmoving frame\u201d if that adjective\n    pertains to each basis, e.g. an *orthogonal frame* is a frame for\n    which each basis is orthogonal (with respect to a given inner\n    product). Given any frame, one can always \u201corthonormalize\u201d it in a\n    smooth manner to provide an orthonormal frame.\n\n-   Frames arise in general relativity as a formalization of the\n    observation that there is no \u201cpreferred\u201d observer standpoint.\n\n[9]{} Wikipedia\u2019s",
