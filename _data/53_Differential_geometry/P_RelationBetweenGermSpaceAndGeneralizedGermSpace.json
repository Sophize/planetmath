  "statement": "Let $X$, $Y$ be a topological spaces and $x\\in X$. Consider and at $x$:\n$$G_x(X,Y);\\ \\ G_x^*(X,Y).$$ If $f:X\\to Y$ is a continuous function,\nthen we have an induced element $[f]\\in G_x^*(X,Y)$. It can be easily\nseen, that if $[f]=[g]\\in G_x(X,Y)$, then $[f]=[g]\\in G_x^*(X,Y)$. In\nparticular we have a well-defined mapping\n$$\\tau:G_x(X,Y)\\to G_x^*(X,Y);$$ $$\\tau([f])=[f].$$\n\n**Proposition 1.** $\\tau$ is injective.\n\n*Proof.* Indeed, assume that $\\tau([f])=\\tau([g])$ for some\n$f,g:X\\to Y$. Let $f':U\\to Y$ and $g':U'\\to Y$ be a representatives of\n$\\tau([f])$ and $\\tau([g])$ respectively. It follows, that there exists\nan open neighbourhood $V\\subseteq X$ of $x$ such that\n$$f_{|V}=f'_{|V}=g'_{|V}=g_{|V}.$$ In particular $[f]=[g]$ in\n$G_x(X,Y)$, which completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Proposition 2.** If $X$ is a normal space and $Y$ is a normal absolute\nretract (for example $Y=\\mathbb{R}$), then $\\tau$ is onto.\n\n*Proof.* Assume that $[f]\\in G_x^*(X,Y)$ for some $f:U\\to Y$. Since $X$\nis regular (because it is normal) then there exists an open\nneighbourhood $V\\subseteq X$ such that the closure\n$\\overline{V}\\subseteq U$. Now since $X$ is normal and $Y$ is a normal\nabsolute retract, then $f_{|\\overline{V}}$ can be extended to entire $X$\n(by the generalized Tietze extension theorem). It is easily seen that\nany such extension gives the same element in $G_x(X,Y)$ (and it is\nindependent on the choice of the representative $f$) and if $F:X\\to Y$\nis an extension of $f_{|\\overline{V}}$, then $$\\tau([F])=[f]$$ because\n$F_{|V}=f_{|V}$. This completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Remark.** If in addition $Y$ is a topological ring (for example\n$Y=\\mathbb{R}$), then it can be easily checked that $\\tau$ preserves\nring structures. In particular if $X$ is normal and $Y=\\mathbb{R}$ or\n$Y=\\mathbb{C}$, then $\\tau$ is an isomorphism of rings. Also it is a\ngood question whether the assumptions in proposition 2 can be weakened.",
