  "definition": "[**Definition:**]{} Let [*M*]{} be a smooth manifold, and [*I,J,K $\\in$\nEnd(TM)*]{} endomorphisms of the tangent bundle satisfying the\nquaternionic relation $$I^2=J^2=K^2=IJK=-Id_{TM}.$$ The manifold\n[*(M,I,J,K)*]{} is called [**hypercomplex**]{} if the almost complex\nstructures [*I, J, K*]{} are [**integrable**]{}. If, in addition,\n[*M*]{} is equipped with a Riemannian metric [*g*]{} which is K\u00e4hler\nwith respect to [*I,J,K*]{}, the manifold [*(M,I,J,K,g)*]{} is called\n[**hyperk\u00e4hler**]{}.\n\nSince [*g*]{} is K\u00e4hler with respect to [*(I,J,K)*]{}, we have\n$$\\nabla I = \\nabla J = \\nabla K=0$$ where $\\nabla$ denotes the\nLevi-Civita connection. This means that the holonomy of $\\nabla$ lies\ninside the group [*Sp(n)*]{} of quaternionic-Hermitian endomorphisms.\nThe converse is also true: a Riemannian manifold is hyperk\u00e4hler if and\nonly if its holonomy is contained in [*Sp(n)*]{}. This definition is\nstandard in differential geometry.\n\nIn physics literature, one sometimes assumes that the holonomy of a\nhyperk\u00e4hler manifold is precisely [*Sp(n)*]{}, and not its proper\nsubgroup. In mathematics, such hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds are called\n[**simple hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds**]{}.\n\nThe following splitting theorem (due to F. Bogomolov) is implied by\nBerger\u2019s classification of irreducible holonomies.\n\n[**Theorem:**]{} Any hyperk\u00e4hler manifold has a finite covering which is\na product of a hyperk\u00e4hler torus and several simple hyperk\u00e4hler\nmanifolds.\n\nConsider the K\u00e4hler forms $\\omega_I, \\omega_J, \\omega_K$ on [*M*]{}:\n$$\\omega_I(\\cdot, \\cdot):= g(\\cdot, I\\cdot), \\ \\\n\\omega_J(\\cdot, \\cdot):= g(\\cdot, J\\cdot), \\ \\\n\\omega_K(\\cdot, \\cdot):= g(\\cdot, K\\cdot).$$ An elementary\nlinear-algebraic calculation implies that the 2-form\n$\\omega_J+\\sqrt{-1}\\omega_K$ is of Hodge type (2,0) on [*(M,I)*]{}. This\nform is clearly closed and non-degenerate, hence it is a holomorphic\nsymplectic form.\n\nIn algebraic geometry, the word \u201chyperk\u00e4hler\u201d is essentially synonymous\nwith \u201cholomorphically symplectic\u201d, due to the following theorem, which\nis implied by Yau\u2019s solution of Calabi conjecture (the famous Calabi-Yau\ntheorem).\n\n[**Theorem:**]{} \\[\\_Calabi-Yau\\_Theorem\\_\\] Let [*(M,I)*]{} be a\ncompact, K\u00e4hler, holomorphically symplectic manifold. Then there exists\na unique hyperk\u00e4hler metric on [*(M,I)*]{} with the same K\u00e4hler class.\n\n[**Remark:**]{} The hyperk\u00e4hler metric is unique, but there could be\nseveral hyperk\u00e4hler structures compatible with a given hyperk\u00e4hler\nmetric on [*(M,I)*]{}.\n\n[6666]{}\n\nBeauville, A.
