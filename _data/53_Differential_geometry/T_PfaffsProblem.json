  "definition": "Given a manifold $M$, let $S$ be a set of differential forms on $M$.\n*Pfaff\u2019s problem* is to determine all submanifolds of $M$ such that the\npullback of any form in $S$ vanishes identically.\n\nIn the context of Pfaff\u2019s problem, a set of differential forms is often\ncalled a *Pfaffian system* and a manifold on which the of these forms\nvanishes is called a solution to this system. Sometimes, (especially in\nolder literature) one also sees a notation like $a \\, dx + b\\,dx = 0$ to\nindicate that the pullback of the form $a \\, dx + b \\, dy$ is required\nto vanish. A more accurate notation would be\n$\\iota_M^* (a \\, dx + b \\,dy) = 0$ which explicitly indicates the\npullback to the submanifold.\n\nGiven a system of local coordinates on $M$, Pfaff\u2019s problem is\nequivalent to a system of partial differential equations. Conversely,\ngiven a system of differential equations, one can find a set of\ndifferential forms such that solutions of the system of equations\ncorrespond to solutions of Pfaff\u2019s problem for that set of forms. In\nthis way, Pfaff\u2019s problem differential geometry and the theory of\ndifferential equations. The resulting cross-fertilization has been\nbeneficial for both .\n\nOn the one hand, translating a system of differential equations into a\nPfaff\u2019s problem makes it easier to discuss the transformation properties\nof that equation since changes of variable for the equation correspond\nto diffeomorphisms of the manifold on which the Pfaff\u2019s problem is\nformulated. This is especially true when the transformations mix\ndependent and independent variables or involve derivatives of variables.\nFor this reason, it is often easier to study the transformation\nproperties and symmetries of a system of differential equations by\nexamining the transformation properties and symmetries of a system of\ndifferential forms corresponding to the system of equations. Also,\nquestions of consistency and integrability conditions are usually much\nmore easily discussed for systems of differential forms than for systems\nof differential equations.\n\nOn the other hand, to prove the existence or uniqueness of a solution to\nPfaff\u2019s problem for a certain class of systems of differential forms, it\nis typical to first translate the statement to be proven to a statement\nabout the existence or uniqueness of a solution to a system of\ndifferential equations and then apply existence and uniqueness theorems\nfor differential equations.\n\nReference: Schouten and v. d.
