  "definition": "Given a plane curve $\\gamma$, its *catacaustic* (Greek\n$\\varkappa\\alpha\\tau\\acute{\\alpha}\\, \\varkappa\\alpha\\upsilon\\sigma\\tau\\iota\\varkappa \\acute{o}\\varsigma$\n\u2018burning along\u2019) is the envelope of a family of rays reflected from\n$\\gamma$ after having emanated from a point (which may be infinitely\nfar, in which case the rays are initially parallel).\n\nFor example, the catacaustic of a logarithmic spiral reflecting the rays\nemanating from the origin is a congruent spiral. The catacaustic of the\n$y = e^x$ reflecting the vertical rays $x = t$ is the catenary\n$y = \\cosh(x\\!+\\!1)$.",
