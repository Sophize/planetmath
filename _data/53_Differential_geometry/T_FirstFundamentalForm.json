  "definition": "In classical differential geometry for embedded two-dimensional surfaces\n$M$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, the Riemannian metric for $M$ induced from the\ndot product of ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ is called the [*first fundamental\nform*]{}.\n\nThere are various notations for the first fundamental form; a common\nnotation is $\\mathcal{I}$, for the roman letter one. Thus,\n$$\\label{simple}\n\\mathcal{I}(v, w) = v \\cdot w$$ for vectors $v, w \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^3$.\n(We consider the tangent planes of $M$ to be two-dimensional subspaces\nof ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$.)\n\nQuadratic form representation {#quadratic-form-representation .unnumbered}\n=============================\n\nRecall, in linear algebra, that a symmetric bilinear form $T$ over\n${\\mathbb{R}}$ can always be represented by its quadratic form $Q$:\n$$T(u, v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\bigl( Q(u+v) - Q(u) - Q(v) \\bigr)\\,, \\quad Q(w) = T(w,w)\\,,$$\nfor any vectors $u$ and $v$. This process may be applied to the first\nfundamental form, and classically, the first fundamental form is\nexpressed as $$\\label{quadratic}\nds^2 = E \\, du^2 + 2F \\, du dv + G \\, dv^2\\,.$$ In modern terminology,\nis the quadratic form that represents the bilinear form $\\mathcal{I}$.\nThe use of the letters $E, F, G$ for the coefficients of the quadratic\nform is traditional, and dates back to Gauss; in terms of the metric\ntensor $g_{ij}$, these coefficients are defined by $E = g_{11}$,\n$F = g_{12} = g_{21}$, $G = g_{22}$.\n\nThe letters $u$ and $v$ in denote local coordinates on $M$. Classically,\n$du$ and $dv$ meant \u201cinfinitesimally small\u201d changes in $u$ and $v$, but\nin modern differential geometry, $du$ and $dv$ have been given a precise\nmeaning using differential forms.\n\nIn tensor notation, is written as $$\\label{tensor}\n\\mathcal{I} = E \\, du \\otimes du + F \\, du \\otimes dv + F \\, dv \\otimes du + G \\, dv \\otimes dv\\,,$$\nAlthough the tensor notation is more clumsy, it allows us to rigorously\njustify a change of variables, by the rule\n$\\alpha^* (du \\otimes dv) = d(\\alpha^*u) \\otimes d(\\alpha^*v)$. See the\nexample below.\n\nThe symbol $ds$ in alludes to $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2\\,,$$ the\ninfinitesimal length of a curve. Compare with the modern notation\n$$\\label{cartesian}\n\\mathcal{I} = dx \\otimes dx + dy \\otimes dy + dz \\otimes dz\\,.$$ (This\nis just an alternate way of writing the definition of $\\mathcal{I}$: the\nrestriction of the dot product on ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$.)\n\nExample: sphere {#example-sphere .unnumbered}\n===============\n\nWe illustrate an example: we compute the first fundamental form\n$\\mathcal{I}$ of the sphere $S^2$ in spherical coordinates\n(latitude/longitude system). We set $$\\begin{aligned}\nx &= \\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta \\\\\ny &= \\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta \\\\\nz &= \\sin \\phi\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ and substitute these in :\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I} &= d (\\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta) \\otimes d(\\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta)\n+ d(\\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta) \\otimes d(\\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta)  \\\\\n&  \\quad + d(\\sin \\phi) \\otimes d(\\sin \\phi) \\\\\n&= (- \\sin \\phi \\cos \\theta \\, d\\phi - \\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta \\, d\\theta)\n\\otimes\n(- \\sin \\phi \\cos \\theta \\, d\\phi - \\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta \\, d\\theta) \\\\\n& \\quad + (- \\sin \\phi \\sin \\theta \\, d\\phi + \\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta) \n\\otimes\n(- \\sin \\phi \\sin \\theta \\, d\\phi + \\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta) \\\\\n& \\quad + (\\cos \\phi \\, d\\phi) \\otimes (\\cos \\phi \\, d\\phi) \\\\\n&= (\\sin \\phi \\cos \\theta)^2 \\, d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi + (\\cos \\phi \\sin \\theta)^2 \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta \\\\\n& \\quad + (\\sin \\phi \\sin \\theta)^2 \\, d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi + (\\cos \\phi \\cos \\theta)^2 \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta  \\\\\n& \\quad + (\\cos \\phi)^2 \\, d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi \\\\\n\\intertext{(note that the cross terms with $d\\phi \\otimes d\\theta$ and $d\\theta \\otimes d\\phi$ cancel)} \n&= \\sin^2 \\phi \\, d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi  + \\cos^2 \\phi \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta + \\cos^2 \\phi \\, d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi \\\\\n&= d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi + \\cos^2 \\phi \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta\\,.\\end{aligned}$$\nOf course this was a very cumbersome calculation; the writing would be\nsimplified if we had just dropped the $\\otimes$ signs and wrote\n$d\\phi^2$ for $d\\phi \\otimes d\\phi$, etc. And even then the calculation\nwould be more organized if we computed the coefficients $g_{ij}$\ndirectly. We only show this kind calculation in order to justify what\nexactly is meant by the classical expression\n$$d\\phi^2 + \\cos^2 \\phi \\, d\\theta^2$$ for the first fundamental form of\nthe sphere.\n\nUse of first fundamental form to compute lengths and areas {#use-of-first-fundamental-form-to-compute-lengths-and-areas .unnumbered}\n==========================================================\n\nThe first fundamental form is related to the area form. If\n$$ds^2 = E \\, du^2 + 2F \\, du dv + G \\, dv^2$$ then\n$$dA = \\sqrt{EG-F^2} \\: du \\wedge dv$$ is the area form. For the sphere,\nthis is\n$$dA = \\sqrt{\\cos^2 \\phi - 0} \\: d\\phi \\wedge d\\theta = \\cos \\phi \\: d\\phi \\wedge d\\theta\\,,$$\nwhich is just the formula given in calculus for evaluating surface\nintegrals on the sphere using spherical coordinates.\n\nThe first fundamental form itself may be used to find the length $s$ of\na curve $\\gamma$ on a surface $M$, when $\\gamma$ is parameterized by\nlocal coordinates: $$\\begin{aligned}\ns &= \\int_\\gamma ds = \\int_\\gamma \\sqrt{ds^2} \\\\\n&= \\int_\\gamma \\sqrt{E \\, du^2 + 2F \\, du dv + G \\, dv^2} \\,,\n\\quad \n\\gamma(t) = (u,v)\\,, \\\\\n&= \\int_a^b \\sqrt{E \\, \\left(\\frac{du}{dt}\\right)^2 + 2F \\, \\frac{du}{dt} \\frac{dv}{dt} + \nG \\, \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt} \\right)^2} \\, dt\\,.\\end{aligned}$$ Although in\npractice it is probably easier to directly use cartesian coordinates,\nrather than the above expressions, to compute the length of $\\gamma$,\nthe first fundamental form plays an essential role in the theoretical\ninvestigation of the lengths of curves on a surface.\n\nExample: plane and cylinder {#example-plane-and-cylinder .unnumbered}\n===========================\n\nFor the plane ${\\mathbb{R}}^2 \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^3$ with $z = 0$, the\nfirst fundamental form is just $$\\label{plane}\nds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2\\,.$$\n\nFor the cylinder with the coordinates $$\\begin{aligned}\nx &= \\cos u \\\\\ny &= \\sin u \\\\\nz &= v\\end{aligned}$$ the first fundamental form is $$\\label{cylinder}\nds^2 = du^2 + dv^2\\,.$$\n\nRelation with isometric maps {#relation-with-isometric-maps .unnumbered}\n============================\n\nNotice that $\\eqref{cylinder}$ looks the same as after renaming the\nvariables. This is evidence that the plane and cylinder should be\nlocally isometric: a flat sheet can be rolled into a cylinder. An\nisometry between two surfaces, by definition, preserves the metric on\nthe two surfaces, so an isometry preserves the first fundamental form.\n\nOf course, and are expressions of the first fundamental form in local\ncoordinates of two different surfaces, so it makes no sense to say they\nare equal. But it is not hard to see that:\n\nSuppose $\\Phi\\colon M \\to N$ is an isometry of two surfaces, and $u, v$\nare coordinates on $M$. If we use the coordinates\n$u' = u \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$ and $v' = v \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$ on $N$, then the\nfirst fundamental form of $N$ is obtained by taking the first\nfundamental form of $M$ and renaming $u, v$ to $u', v'$.\n\nRelation with conformal, equiareal maps {#relation-with-conformal-equiareal-maps .unnumbered}\n=======================================\n\nThere is also a notion of a conformal mapping: a diffeomorphism\n$\\Phi \\colon M \\to N$ is called [*conformal*]{} if $\\Phi$ preserves the\nfirst fundamental form up to a non-zero constant of proportionality.\n(The proportion may vary at each point of $M$ and $N$.) It may be\nverified that this is the same as saying that $\\Phi$ preserves the\nangles of intersecting tangent vectors.\n\nFor example, the stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane\nis conformal.\n\nYet another notion is that of an equiareal mapping: a diffeomorphism\n$\\Phi \\colon M \\to N$ is called [*equiareal*]{} if $\\Phi$ preserves\npreserves areas of all subregions of the surfaces. This amounts to\nsaying that the quantity $\\sqrt{EG - F^2}$ is invariant under $\\Phi$\n(provided we rename the variables as explained above).\n\nFor example, the projection of the sphere to the cylinder wrapping it is\nequiareal. This fact was used by Archimedes to show the sphere of radius\n$r$ has area $4\\pi r^2$, because the cylinder that wraps it also has\narea $4\\pi r^2$.\n\nIf $\\Phi$ is both conformal and equiareal, then it is an isometry. As a\nwell-known example, a sphere is not isometric to the plane, not even\nlocally, so we cannot draw maps of the Earth that preserve both\ndirections and relative proportion of lands. We must give up at least\none of these properties: e.g. the Mercator projection preserves\ndirection only; maps with Mercator look \u201cstrange\u201d the first time one\nsees them, because such maps do not preserve area.\n\nRelation with Gaussian curvature {#relation-with-gaussian-curvature .unnumbered}\n================================\n\nThere is a formula for the Gaussian curvature $K(p)$ at a point on a\nsurface: $$K = \\frac{\\left\\lvert \\begin{matrix}\n-\\frac{1}{2} E_{vv} + F_{uv} - \\frac{1}{2} G_{uu} & \\frac{1}{2} E_u & F_u - \\frac{1}{2} E_v \\\\\nF_v - \\frac{1}{2} G_u & E & F \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} G_v & F & G \n\\end{matrix}\\right\\rvert\n- \\left\\lvert \\begin{matrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{2} E_v & \\frac{1}{2} G_u \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} E_v & E & F \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} G_u & F & G\n\\end{matrix}\\right\\rvert}{(EG-F^2)^2}$$ where the bars denote the\ndeterminant, and the subscripts denote partial derivatives.\n\nThis formula is known as Brioschi\u2019s formula; Brioschi had stated it\nwithout proof in 1854, and later it was calculated by Gauss.\n\nThe immediate corollary of this strange formula is:\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of a surface is unchanged under isometries\n(because it only depends on the first fundamental form).\n\nThis theorem is not obvious, since the usual definitions of the Gaussian\ncurvature are not invariant (they depend on the particular embedding of\nthe surface in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$).\n\n[3]{} Michael Spivak.
