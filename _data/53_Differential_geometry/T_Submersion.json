  "definition": "A differentiable map $f\\colon X\\to Y$ differential manifolds $X$ and $Y$\nis called a *submersion at a point* $x\\in X$ if the tangent map\n$$\\mathrm{T}f(x)\\colon\\mathrm{T}X(x)\\to\\mathrm{T}Y(f(x))$$ between the\ntangent spaces of $X$ and $Y$ at $x$ and $f(x)$ is surjective.\n\nIf $f$ is a submersion at every point of $X$, then $f$ is called a\n*submersion*. A submersion $f\\colon X\\to Y$ is an open mapping, and its\nimage is an open submanifold of $Y$.\n\nA fibre bundle $p\\colon X\\to B$ over a manifold $B$ is an example of a\nsubmersion.",
