  "definition": "A *zero-sum game* is a game in which only one player can win (that is,\nachieve the goal of the game) and the losses (the failure to obtain a\ngoal of the game) of any player are matched by gains by another player.\nA zero-sum game is a finite game (a game that eventually comes to an\nend), and though only one player can win, the game can also end in a\ndraw (meaning that neither side can win).\n\nFor example, in chess, when a player loses a piece captured by another\nplayer, the other player gains more open avenues on which to attack the\nking of the opponent. In Reversi (or Othello), a player must capture at\nleast one of the opponent\u2019s pieces; if not, then the player must pass.\nIn poker, all players must contribute to the pot; whoever has the best\nhand claims the entire pot and the losers lose everything they put in\nthe pot.\n\nZero-sum games were extensively studied by John von Neumann.",
