  "definition": "Suppose you invest $P$ at time $0$ and receive payments\n$P_1,\\ldots, P_n$ at times $t_1,\\ldots,t_n$ corresponding to interest\nrates (evaluated from $0$) $r_1,\\ldots, r_n$. The net present value of\nthis investment is\n$$NPV=-P+\\frac{P_1}{1+r_1}+\\frac{P_2}{1+r_2}+\\cdots+\\frac{P_n}{1+r_n}.$$\n\nThe *rate of return* $r$ of this investment is a compound interest rate,\ncompounded at every unit time period, such that the net present value of\nthe investment is $0$. In other words, if $r$, as a real number, exists,\nit satisfies the following equation:\n$$P=\\frac{P_1}{(1+r)^{t_1}}+\\frac{P_2}{(1+r)^{t_2}}+\\cdots+\\frac{P_n}{(1+r)^{t_n}}.$$\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n-   We typically assume that $t_1\\le t_2\\le \\cdots \\le t_n$, and, in\n    most situations, that they are integers, so that the equation is a\n    polynomial equation.\n\n-   However, there is no guarantee that $r$ exists, and if it exists,\n    that it is unique.\n\n-   Nevertheless, one can usually, by trial-and-error, determine if such\n    an $r$ exists. If $r$ exists, and if $P_i$ are all non-negative,\n    then by , $r$ is always unique and $r>-1$.",
