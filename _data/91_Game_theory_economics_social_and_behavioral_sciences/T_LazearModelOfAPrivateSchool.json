  "definition": "The economist Edward P. Lazear defined a theoretical of a (private)\nprofit maximizing school and was able to derive some interesting\nconclusions from the model. Here we describe the model.\n\nThe school has a fixed number, $Z$ of students. The cost of a teacher is\n$W>0$. Each student is assumed to be not disruptive with a probability\n$p$. So if the class has $n$ students the probability of \u201cpeace in the\nclassroom\u201d is $p^n$. Only when there is peace can any learning take\nplace. The school charges according the class size and all students in\nthe class of size $n$ pay the same amount. Assuming that the value of a\nunit of learning is $V>0$ and that there are $m$ classes, the average\nclass size is $n=Z/m$. The expected revenue then is\n$Vmn p^{Z/m} =VZp^{Z/m}$. And the cost for these $m$ classes is $Wm$.\nThen the expected profit is $VZp^{Z/m}-Wm$. This is a function to be\nmaximized.\n\nUsing this theoretical framework Lazear was able to show:\n\n1.  As $p$ increases it is optimal to use fewer classes, so that class\n    size increases.\n\n2.  As $W$ increases it is optimal to use fewer classes, so that class\n    size increases.\n\nLazear briefly considered an extension of the model to the case where\nthere are two types of students, having different disruption\nprobabilities. He concluded that if the school wants to maximize revenue\nit would segregate the students, that is, there would be no mixed\nclasses.\n\n[10]{} , *Educational Production*, Quarterly Journal of Economics,\nCXVI(2001), 777-801.",
