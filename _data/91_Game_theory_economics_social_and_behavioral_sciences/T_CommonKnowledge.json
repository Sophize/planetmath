  "definition": "In a game, a fact (such as the rules of the game) is *common knowledge*\nfor the player if:\n\nAll the players know the fact.\n\nAll the players know that all the players know the fact.\n\nAll the players know that all the players know that all the players know\nthe fact.\n\n$\\cdots$\n\nThis is a much stronger condition than merely having all the players\nknow the fact. By way of illustration, consider the following example:\n\nThere are three participants and an experimenter. The experimenter\ninforms them that a hat, either blue or red, will be placed on their\nhead so that the other participants can see it but the wearer cannot.\nThe experimenter then puts red hats on each person and asks whether any\nof them know what color hat they have. Of course, none of them do. The\nexperimenter then whispers to each of them that at least two people have\nred hats, and then asks out loud whether any of them know what color hat\nthey have. Again, none of them do. Finally the experimenter announces\nout loud that at least two people have red hats, and asks whether any of\nthem know what color hat they have. After a few seconds, all three\nrealize that they must have red hats, since if they had a blue hat then\nboth of the other people could have figured out that their own hat was\nred.\n\nThe significant thing about this example is that the fact that at least\ntwo of the participants have red hats was known to every participant\nfrom the beginning, but only once they knew that the other people also\nknew that could they figure out their own hat\u2019s color. (This is only the\nsecond requirement in the list above, but more complicated examples can\nbe constructed for any level in the infinite list).",
