  "definition": "Suppose you are going to receive $\\$10,000$, to be paid in two payments\nat the end of the next two years. You have the following two options\n\n   options     year 1      year 2\n  ---------- ----------- -----------\n   option 1   $\\$6,000$   $\\$4,000$\n   option 2   $\\$4,000$   $\\$6,000$\n\nWhich option would you select in order to have the maximum gain? Of\ncourse, if there is no interest, both options are equal. If any non-zero\ninterest rates are involved, one option may be preferable than the\nother.\n\nBy calculating the *present values* of these options, one may be able to\ncompare the \u201cpresent\u201d values of these payments and figure out which is\nthe preferable option. So what is a *present value*?\n\n**Definition**. Let $P$ be the amount of a payment at sometime $t>0$ in\nthe future. then the *present value* $\\operatorname{PV}(P)$ of $P$ is\nsimply the value of this payment at time $t=0$. Specifically, if the\ninterest rate from $0$ to $t$ is $r$, then\n$$\\operatorname{PV}(P)=\\frac{P}{1+r}.$$ In other words, if we invest\n$\\operatorname{PV}(P)$ today, earning an interest at a rate of $r$\nbetween times $0$ and $t$, then at time $t$, we would have made $P$.\n\nNow, suppose in the example above, both options have an of $5\\%$ , then\nthe present value of option 1 is\n$$\\frac{\\$6,000}{1.05}+\\frac{\\$4,000}{(1.05)^2}\\approx \\$9,342.40$$\nwhereas the second option has present value\n$$\\frac{\\$4,000}{1.05}+\\frac{\\$6,000}{(1.05)^2}\\approx \\$9,251.70$$\nClearly, the first option is superior than the second one.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Of course, the result will be the same if one instead computes the\n    *future values* of these options, which are the values of the\n    payments at a specific future time $t>0$: if payment is valued at\n    $P$ at time $0$, its value at some future time $t>0$, or its *future\n    value* is $$\\operatorname{FV}(P)=P(1+r),$$ if $r$ is the interest\n    rate from $0$ to $t$.\n\n-   An accompanying concept is that of the *net present value*\n    $\\operatorname{NPV}$. It is the present value of all the future\n    payments minus the initial investment: suppose an investment $I$ is\n    made where an initial amount of $A$ is made at time $0$, and\n    payments $P_1,\\ldots,P_n$ are returns as a result of this\n    investment. Then\n    $$\\operatorname{NPV}(I)=\\Big(\\operatorname{PV}(P_1)+\\operatorname{PV}(P_2)+\\cdots  +\\operatorname{PV}(P_n)\\Big)-A.$$\n\nIf we treat the initial invsetment $A$ as a \u201cnegative\u201d return,\n$A=-P_0=-\\operatorname{PV}(P_0)$, then the net present value of the\ninvestment can be written\n$$\\operatorname{NPV}(I)=\\operatorname{PV}(P_0)+\\operatorname{PV}(P_1)+\\cdots  +\\operatorname{PV}(P_n)=\\sum_{i=0}^n \\operatorname{PV}(P_i).$$\nOne would usually want to invest in something with a positive net\npresent value. Net present values are commonly used when one is\ninterested in comparing car loans or home mortgages.",
