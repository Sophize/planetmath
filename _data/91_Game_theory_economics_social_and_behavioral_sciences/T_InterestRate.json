  "definition": "An *interest rate*, loosely speaking, is the rate in which interest\naccumulates over time. There are different ways of measuring this\nchange. In other words, there are different types of interest rates.\nSuppose we are given the following setup:\n\n1.  there is a borrower $B$ and a lender $L$ and that\u2019s it\n\n2.  at time $0$, a transaction takes place where $L$ loans $M$ to $B$\n\n3.  at times $t_1$ and $t_2$, the interests accrued are $i(t_1)$ and\n    $i(t_2)$\n\n**Interest rate**. The *interest rate* is defined as the value\n$$r(t_1,t_2):=\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{i(t_2)-i(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.$$ If we set\n$M(t)=M+i(t)$, then $M(0)=M$ and\n$$r(t_1,t_2)=\\frac{1}{M(0)}\\frac{M(t_2)-M(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.$$ $M(t_1)$ can\nbe interpreted as the \u201caccumulated\u201d principal at $t_1$, although the\ntransaction of the interest *actually* being added to the principal is\nnot assumed.\n\n**Effective interest rate**. Another way of measuring the rate in which\ninterest change with respect to $t$ is known as the *effective interest\nrate*. It is defined as:\n$$\\operatorname{eff.}r(t_1,t_2):=\\frac{1}{M(t_1)} \\frac{i(t_2)-i(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}=\\frac{1}{M(t_1)} \\frac{M(t_2)-M(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.$$\nUnlike the ordinary interest rate, effective interest rate measures the\nchanges in interest relative to the principal at the beginning of the\ntime period that is being measured, rather than the original principal.\n\n**Discount rate**. The *discount rate* is defined as:\n$$d(t_1,t_2):=\\frac{1}{M(t_2)} \\frac{i(t_2)-i(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}=\\frac{1}{M(t_2)} \\frac{M(t_2)-M(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.$$\nThis is very similar to the definition of the effective interest rate.\nThe difference here is the we are interested in looking at changes in\ninterest relative to the end of the time period. The following\nrelationship is useful:\n$$\\frac{1}{d(t_1,t_2)}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{eff.}r(t_1,t_2)}=t_2-t_1.$$\nDiscount rate is handy when one wants to know the current, or present\nvalue of some amount of money in the future, for example, looking at the\npresent value of the total mortgage to be paid 30 years into the future.\n\n**Others**. If we include the effect of inflation, or any changes\naffecting the value of money not due to interest, we have\n\n1.  real interest rate - the interest rate calculated based on the\n    \u201creal\u201d value of money, adjusted for inflation, and\n\n2.  nominal interest rate - the interest rate calculated based on the\n    \u201cface\u201d, or \u201cunadjusted\u201d value of money.\n\n**Interest rate continuous with respect to time**. When $M$ is a\ndifferentiable function with respect to $t$, we may define what is\ncalled the *instantaneous interest rate*:\n$$r(t)=\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{dM(t)}{dt},$$ and the corresponding\n*instantaneous effective interest rate*\n$$\\operatorname{eff.}r(t)=\\frac{1}{M(t)}\\frac{dM(t)}{dt}.$$\n\n[8]{} S.
