  "definition": "A [*finite game*]{} is a game in which each instance of the game is\ndesigned to reach a conclusion, either as a natural consequence of\nnormal play, or due to the rules of the game.\n\nFor example, a game of Reversi is over when all the squares of the board\nhave been filled up, if not sooner. Most chess games end with one side\ntrapping the opponent\u2019s king. Theoretically, certain scenarios could go\non indefinitely if both sides lack the resources to trap the opponent\u2019s\nking; for example, if White has only a king and a knight, and Black has\nonly the king left, Black could theoretically evade indefinitely if it\nweren\u2019t for the stalemate rule.",
