  "definition": "The [*15 Puzzle*]{} is a square tablet containing 15 smaller square\ntiles labeled with the integers 1 to 15, set so that only one square may\nbe moved at a time into the only available empty square by a move up or\ndown or left or right (but never diagonally). The goal of the puzzle is\nto take a puzzle in an unsorted initial state, such as\n\n  ---- ---- ---- ----\n   7    8         1\n   2    3    4    5\n   6    9    10   11\n   12   13   14   15\n  ---- ---- ---- ----\n\nand set each tile in its proper order.\n\n  ---- ---- ---- ----\n   1    2    3    4\n   5    6    7    8\n   9    10   11   12\n   13   14   15  \n  ---- ---- ---- ----\n\nThe puzzle was invented by Noyes Chapman, who also created a famously\nunsolvable version with 14 and 15 switched. His original idea was to\nconstruct a puzzle with 16 tiles that would be moved to form a magic\nsquare with 34 as its magic constant. The 15 Puzzle was initially made\nof wood; today they are almost always made of plastic. Darling calls it\n\u201cthe Rubik\u2019s cube of its day.\u201d\n\n[1]{} D.
