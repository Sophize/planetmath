  "definition": "Utility is taken to be an absolute, accurate measurement of how\ndesirable something is; in particular, it differs from money in three\nkey ways.\n\nFirst, desire for it is linear (generally in economics and game a person\nwith a lot of money receives less utility from an additional amount of\nmoney than someone with very little money).\n\nSecond, when modeling a situation, utility should include all external\n(the happiness received from doing a good deed, for instance).\n\nThird, different people\u2019s utility is incomparable. It is meaningless to\nask whether one person gets more utility from a situation than another\nperson does. Utilities for a given person can be compared only to other\nutilities for that person.\n\nA utility function is a function which specifies how much utility a\nplayer gets for a particular outcome. It maps the space $S$ of all\npossible strategy profiles to $\\mathbb{R}$.",
