  "definition": "*Heaps\u2019 law* describes the portion of a vocabulary which is represented\nby an instance document (or set of instance documents) consisting of\nwords chosen from the vocabulary. This can be formulated as\n\n$$V_R(n) = Kn^\\beta$$\n\nWhere $V_R$ is the portion of the vocabulary $V$ ($V_R \\subseteq V$)\nrepresented by the instance text of size $n$. $K$ and $\\beta$ are free\nparameters determined empirically.\n\nWith English text corpuses, typically $K$ is between 10 and 100, and\n$.4 \\le \\beta \\le .6$.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   ![A typical Heaps-law plot. The y-axis represents the text size, and the x-axis represents the number of distinct vocabulary elements present in the text. Compare the values of the two axes.](heapslaw.eps \"fig:\")\n                                                                                        [(generated by GNU Octave and gnuplot) ]{}\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeaps\u2019 law means that as more instance text is gathered, there will be\ndiminishing returns in terms of discovery of the full vocabulary from\nwhich the distinct terms are drawn.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Heaps\u2019 law applies in the general case\nwhere the \u201cvocabulary\u201d is just some set of distinct types which are\nattributes of some collection of objects. For example, the objects could\nbe people, and the types could be country of origin of the person. If\npersons are selected randomly (that is, we are not selecting based on\ncountry of origin), then Heaps\u2019 law says we will quickly have\nrepresentatives from most countries (in proportion to their population)\nbut it will become increasingly difficult to cover the entire set of\ncountries by continuing this method of sampling.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n-   Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, *Modern Information Retrieval*, ACM\n    Press, 1999.",
