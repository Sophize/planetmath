  "statement": "[**Sampling Theorem**]{}\n\nThe greyvalues of digitized one- or two-dimensional signals are\ntypically generated by an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), by\nsampling a continuous signal at fixed intervals (e.g. in time), and\nquantizing (digitizing) the samples. The sampling (or point sampling)\ntheorem states that a band-limited analogue signal $x_a(t)$, i.e. a\nsignal in a finite frequency band (e.g. between 0 and BHz), can be\ncompletely reconstructed from its samples $x(n) = x(nT)$, if the\nsampling frequency is greater than $2B$ (the Nyquist rate); expressed in\nthe , this that the sampling interval $T$ is at most $\\frac{1}{2B}$\nseconds. Undersampling can produce serious errors (aliasing) by\nintroducing artifacts of low frequencies, both in one-dimensional\nsignals and in digital .\n\n![image](img988.eps)\n\n[**References**]{}\n\n-   Originally from the Data Analysis Briefbook ()",
