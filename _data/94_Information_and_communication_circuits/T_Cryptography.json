  "definition": "Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding messages so that\nthey are only understood by intended senders and recipients.\n\nInformally, the basic ingredients in cryptography consist of\n\n1.  An alphabet $\\Sigma$. A word over $\\Sigma$ is called a *plaintext*\n    or *cleartext*. The set $M:=\\Sigma^*$ of all plaintexts is called\n    the *message space*.\n\n2.  An alphabet $\\Delta$. A word over $\\Delta$ is called a *ciphertext*\n    or *cryptotext*. The set $C:=\\Delta^*$ of all ciphertexts is called\n    the *ciphertext space*.\n\n3.  A set $K$ called the key space, such that each $k\\in K$, called a\n    *key*, determines functions $e_k: M\\to C$ and $d_k:C\\to M$ called\n    *encryption function* and *decryption function* respectively. It is\n    generally required that $d_k\\circ e_k = 1_M$ (and usually\n    $e_k\\circ d_k=1_C$ so that $e_k$ and $d_k$ are inverses of one\n    another). The pair $(e_k,d_k)$ is usually called a *key pair*.\n\nThe triple $(M,C,K)$ is called a *cryptosystem*.\n\nGiven a cryptosystem, one generally wants both $e_k$ and $d_k$ to be\neasily computable, so that encryption by the sender and decryption by\nthe intended receiver can be done effortlessly. For example, if $A$ were\nto send $B$ an encrypted message, $A$ needs to be able to *easily*\nencrypt a plaintext $u$ into a ciphertext $v=e_k(u)$. Upon receiving\n$v$, the intended receiver $B$ needs to be able to *easily* decrypt $v$\ninto plaintext $u=d_k(v)$. On the other hand, one also wants the task of\nrecovering the plaintext from the ciphertext very difficult, or\nintractible, without knowing the decryption functions $d_k$. For\nexample, if an eavesdropper $C$ ever gets hold of $v$, he/she will have\na very hard time recovering $u$ without knowing $d_k$, sometimes even in\nthe presence of knowing $e_k$.\n\nHere, the adjectives \u201ceasy\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d, \u201cintractible\u201d are measured in\nterms of the complexity involved in the computations. For example,\n\u201ceasy\u201d could mean that the time involved in the computations depends\nlinearly on the length of the input $u$ (hopefully with a small\ncoefficient), whereas \u201cdifficult\u201d could mean the dependence be\nexponential instead. A function $f$ such that it is easy to compute\n$f(u)$ given $u$ but very hard to find $u$ given $f(u)$ is usually\ncalled a *one-way function*. For example, $f(m,n)=mn$ where $m,n$ are\nprimes, is one-way, or nearly so. It is easy to multiply, but very hard\nto factor, particularly when both $m$ and $n$ are large.\n\nThe study of cryptogrpahy thus can be loosely broken up into two main\nbranches: the construction of a good cryptosystem (meaning that the\nencryption functions should be one-way, and the decryption functions\nshould be easy to compute), and the breaking of a ciphertext in some\ngiven setting (for example, where the encryption functions are known).\nThe latter of the two branches is also known as *cryptanalysis*.\n\nThe mathematics behind cryptography involves a variety of disciplines,\nof which the main ones are information theory, formal languages,\ncomputational complexity, probability theory, and number theory.\n\nCryptographic methods range from simple additive ciphers to\nsophisticated public key encryption systems, first introduced by Diffie\nand Hellman in the mid 1970\u2019s.",
