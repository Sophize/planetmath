  "definition": "Let $A=\\lbrace a_0,a_1,\\ldots, a_{n-1}\\rbrace$ be a finite set indexed\nby $i=0,\\ldots, n-1$. A *cyclic permutation* on $A$ is a permutation\n$\\pi$ on $A$ such that, for some integer $k$,\n$$\\pi(a_i)=a_{(i+k)\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\! \\pmod n},$$ where\n$a\\!\\!\\pmod b:= a - \\lfloor a/b \\rfloor b$, the remainder of $a$ when\ndivided by $b$, and $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the floor function.\n\nFor example, if $A=\\lbrace 1,2,\\ldots,m\\rbrace$ such that $a_i=i+1$.\nThen a cyclic permutation $\\pi$ on $A$ has the form $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(1) &=& r \\\\\n\\pi(2) &=& r+1 \\\\\n&\\vdots & \\\\\n\\pi(m-r+1) &=& m \\\\\n\\pi(m-r+2) &=& 1 \\\\\n&\\vdots & \\\\\n\\pi(m) &=& r-1.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn the usual permutation notation, it looks like\n$$\\pi=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n1 & 2 & \\cdots & m-r+1 & m-r+2 & \\cdots & m \\\\\nr & r+1 & \\cdots & m & 1 & \\cdots & r-1 \\end{array} \\right)$$\n\n**Remark**. For every finite set of cardinality $n$, there are $n$\ncyclic permutations. Each non-trivial cyclic permutation has order $n$.\nFurthermore, if $n$ is a prime number, the set of cyclic permutations\nforms a cyclic group.\n\n### Cyclic permutations on words {#cyclic-permutations-on-words .unnumbered}\n\nGiven a word $w=a_1a_2\\cdots a_n$ on a set $\\Sigma$ (may or may not be\nfinite), a *cyclic conjugate* of $w$ is a word $v$ derived from $w$\nbased on a cyclic permutation. In other words,\n$v=\\pi(a_1)\\pi(a_2)\\cdots \\pi(a_n)$ for some cyclic permutation $\\pi$ on\n$\\lbrace a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\rbrace$. Equivalently, $v$ and $w$ are cyclic\nconjugates of one another iff $w=st$ and $v=ts$ for some words $s,t$.\n\nFor example, the cyclic conjugates of the word $ababa$ over\n$\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ are\n$$baba^2,\\quad aba^2b,\\quad ba^2ba,\\quad a^2bab,\\quad\\mbox{and itself}.$$\nStrictly speaking, $\\pi$ is a cyclic permutation on the *multiset*\n$A=\\lbrace a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\rbrace$, which can be thought of as a cyclic\npermutation on the set $A'=\\lbrace (1,a_1),\\ldots, (n,a_n)\\rbrace$.\nFurthermore, $\\pi$ can be extended to a function on $A^*$: for every\nword $w=a_{\\phi(1)}\\cdots a_{\\phi(m)}$,\n$\\pi(w):=\\pi(a_{\\phi(1)})\\cdots \\pi(a_{\\phi(m)})$, where $\\phi$ is a\npermutation on $A$.\n\nGiven any word $w=a_1a_2\\cdots a_n$ on $\\Sigma$, two cyclic permutations\n$\\pi_1,\\pi_2$ on $\\lbrace a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\rbrace$ are said to be the\n*same* if $\\pi_1(w)=\\pi_2(w)$. For example, with the word $abab$, then\nthe cyclic permutation $$\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\end{array} \\right)$$ is the same as the identity\npermutation. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all\ncyclic conjugates of $w$ and the set of all *distinct* cyclic\npermutations on $\\lbrace a_0,a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\rbrace$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In a group $G$, if two elements $u,v$ are cyclic conjugates of one\n    another, then they are conjugates: for if $u=st$ and $v=ts$, then\n    $v=t(st)t^{-1}=tut^{-1}$.\n\n-   Cyclic permutations were used as a ciphering scheme by Julius\n    Caesar. Given an alphabet with letters, say $a,b,c, \\ldots,x,y,z$,\n    messages in letters are encoded so that each letter is shifted by\n    three places. For example, the name\n\n    \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d becomes \u201cMxolxv Fdhvdu\u201d.\n\n    A ciphering scheme based on cyclic permutations is therefore also\n    known as a *Caesar shift cipher*.",
