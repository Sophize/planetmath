  "definition": "A **sign relational complex** is a generalization of a sign relation\nthat allows for empty components in the *elementary sign relations*, or\nsign relational triples of the form\n$(\\mathrm{object}, \\mathrm{sign}, \\mathrm{interpretant})$.\n\nGenerally speaking, when it comes to things that are being contemplated\nas ostensible or potential signs of other things, neither the existence\nnor the uniqueness of the elements appearing in the sign relation is\nguaranteed. For example, the reference of a putative sign to its\nputative objects may actually achieve reference to zero, to one, or to\nmany objects. A proper treatment of this complication calls for the\nconception of something slightly more general than a sign relation\nproper, namely, a sign relational complex. Expressed in practical terms,\nthis allows for *missing data* in the columns of the relational database\ntable for the sign relation in question. Typically one operates on the\ndefault assumption that all of the roles of elementary sign relations\nare actually filled, but remains wary enough of the possible exceptions\nto deal with them on an *ad hoc* basis.",
