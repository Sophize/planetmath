  "definition": "Let $C$ be a linear code over a finite field $A$ of block length $n$.\n$C$ is called a *cyclic code*, if for every codeword\n$c=(c_1,\\ldots,c_n)$ from $C$, the word\n$(c_n,c_1,\\ldots,c_{n-1})\\in A^n$ obtained by a right shift of is also a\ncodeword from $C$.\n\nSometimes, $C$ is called *the* $c$-cyclic code, if $C$ is the smallest\ncyclic code containing $c$, or, in other words, $C$ is the linear code\ngenerated by $c$ and all codewords obtained by shifts of its .\n\nFor example, if $A=\\mathbb{F}_2$ and $n=3$, the codewords contained in\nthe $(1,1,0)$-cyclic code are precisely\n$$(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1)\\text{ and }(1,0,1).$$\n\nTrivial examples of cyclic codes are $A^n$ itself and the code\ncontaining only the zero codeword.",
