  "definition": "A binary code is called *even* if the Hamming weight of all its\ncodewords is even. Furthermore, a binary code is called *doubly-even* if\nthe Hamming weight of all its codewords is divisible by $4$. An even\ncode which is not doubly-even is said to be *strictly even*.\n\nExamples of doubly-even codes are the extended binary Hamming code of\nblock length $8$ and the extended binary Golay code of block length\n$24$. These two codes are, in addition, self-dual.",
