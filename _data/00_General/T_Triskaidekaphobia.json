  "definition": "*Triskaidekaphobia* is the irrational fear of the number 13. This fear\nis recognized as a mental disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV). Few mathematicians suffer from\ntriskaidekaphobia; generally it\u2019s artists who are afflicted. For\nexample, the composer Arnold Schoenberg and the pianist Glenn Gould.\nHowever, Benjamin Franklin was mildly afflicted: if there were 13 people\nat his dinner table, he would call for his secretary to join the party.\nHe was apparently not bothered by the fact that the United States at the\ntime consisted of 13 states and the flag had 13 stars and 13 stripes.\nThe rationale for Franklin\u2019s affliction seems to have been that there\nwere 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus Christ. Architects for the\nmost part don\u2019t have to worry about triskaidekaphobia when building new\nbuildings, but when working on existing buildings they have to remember\nto subtract one if the building\u2019s 13th floor was renumbered 14.\n\n[1]{} W. Clarke, (2003): 7",
