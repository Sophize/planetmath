  "definition": "In mathematics, a [*hypothesis*]{} is an unproven statement which is\nsupported by all the available data and by many weaker results. An\nunproven mathematical statement is usually called a \u201cconjecture\u201d, and\nwhile experimentation can sometimes produce millions of examples to\nsupport a conjecture, usually nothing short of a proof can convince\nexperts in the field. But when a conjecture is supported not only but\nall the available data but also by numerous weaker results, it is\nupgraded in label to a hypothesis. The most famous conjecture in\nmathematics is the Riemann hypothesis, which despite many attempts at a\nproof, is supported by many related results. The convexity conjecture,\non the other hand, is considered \u201cincompatible\u201d with the $n$-tuples\nconjecture and more results appear to support the latter, thus neither\nis upgraded to hypothesis.\n\n[1]{} R.
