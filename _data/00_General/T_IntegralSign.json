  "definition": "The [*integral sign*]{} $$\\int$$ is a stylised version of the [*long\ns*]{} letter.\n\nThe long s is a typographic variant of lowercase s, being the only\nlowercase s in the Carolingian minuscule script. The modern short\n(round) s appeared later to the ends of words, and has now replaced\ncompletely the long s in the antiqua script.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz introduced the integral sign as the first\nletter s of the Latin word [*summa*]{} (\u2018sum\u2019). The long shape of\n$\\displaystyle\\int$ may be thought to symbolically depict the fact that\nis a limiting case of sum.\\\nA variant $$\\oint$$ of the integral sign is used in integrals taken\nalong a closed curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ or about a closed surface in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$; see e.g. Cauchy integral theorem, derivation of heat\nequation.\\\nThe function given after the integral sign, i.e. the function to be\n[*integrated*]{}, is the [*integrand*]{}.",
