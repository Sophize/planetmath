  "definition": "This entry mostly concerns the mathematical aspects of interest. Also,\nwe assume that the value of a unit amount of money does not change with\ntime (so there is no consideration regarding inflation, etc...)\n\nLet\u2019s first look at two common examples in real life:\n\n1.  An individual deposits a certain amount of money into an entity (a\n    bank, for example) for a period of time, interest is accrued at the\n    end of the time period payable to the individual by the entity.\n\n2.  One borrows a certain amount of money from an entity (a loan\n    company, for example) for a period of time, interest is accrued at\n    the end of the time period payable to the entity by the borrower.\n\nIn both examples, two parties, or *entities* are involved. Let\u2019s call\none the lender $L$ and the other the borrower $B$. Between $L$ and $B$,\nthere is an initial *transaction* where a certain amount of money $M$,\ncalled the *principal*, is transferred from one to another. $M$ can be\nseen as a function of $L$ and $B$: $M=M(L,B)$ and has the property that\n$M(L,B)+M(B,L)=0$. This property basically says that $B$ borrowing $M$\nfrom $L$ is equivalent to $L$ borrowing $-M$ from $B$. Let us agree that\n$M(L,B)\\ge 0$.\n\nAt a later time $t$, an *interest* is accrued. Put it another way, $M$\nhas \u201cgrown\u201d to $M(t)$. Set the initial transaction at time $0$, then\n$M=M(0)$. From this point of view, *interest* $i$, is the \u201cadditional\u201d\namount of money earned, or accrued, between $0$ and $t$, or\n$i=M(t)-M(0)$. If we want to emphasize $L$ and $B$ as the additional\nvariables, then the definition, fully stated, becomes\n$$i(L,B,t):=M(L,B,t)-M(L,B,0).$$ We can calculate interest between any\ntwo time periods. For example, if we know $i(L,B,t)$ and $i(L,B,s)$,\nthen the interest earned from $t$ to $s$ is simply the difference of the\ntwo: $$i(L,B,t,s):=i(L,B,s)-i(L,B,t)=M(L,B,s)-M(L,B,t).$$ Keep in mind\nis that in this definition, only one transaction has taken place: the\ninitial one at $0$ (we assume that at time $t$, an interest has been\nmerely been accrued but no actual transfer of money is taking place).\nInterests resulting from additional transactions that happened between\n$0$ and $t$ need to be evaluated separately.\n\nThe last paragraph merely says that $i$ is additive with respect to\n*transactions*: if $L_1$ loans $M_1$ to $B_1$ at $t_1$, and $L_2$ loans\n$M_2$ to $B_2$ at $t_2$, then the *total* interest earned by the lenders\nfrom the borrowers at time $t$ is\n$$i(L,B,t)= i_1(L_1,B_1,t)+ i_2(L_2,B_2,t),$$ where $L$ is $L_1$ and\n$L_2$ considered as a single lending entity, and $B$ is $B_1$ and $B_2$\nconsidered as a single borrowing entity.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Note that $t$ does not always have to be positive. It is possible\n    that we are interested in finding what $i$ is at time $t\\le 0$. For\n    example, one may want to know the amount of interest lost had he\n    saved his money in a bank and earned interest 30 years earlier, well\n    before his current retirement age.\n\n-   Another point worth stressing is that the defintion only works if we\n    stick to the same units. If $M$ is expressed as U.S. Dollars, then\n    that needs to be the unit of choice for money throughout. Any other\n    denominations or currencies need to be converted. The same goes with\n    time $t$.\n\n[8]{} S. G. Kellison, [*Theory of Interest*]{}, McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2nd\nEdition, (1991).",
