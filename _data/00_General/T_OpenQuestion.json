  "definition": "The adjective *open* is used by mathematicians to a statement which has\nneither been proven to be true or to be false. (In the light of\nincompleteness thorems, we should perhaps also add \u201cnot been proven to\nbe independent of the axioms\u201d)\n\nExamples:\n\n\u201cIt is an open question whether there are an infinite number of prime\nnumbers all of whose digits are 1.\u201d means that it neither has been\nproven that there exist an infinity of such primes nor been proven that\nthere are only a finite number of such primes.\n\n\u201cIt is an open problem to determine the smallest number of lines which\ncontain all points of the set $S$.\u201d means that the number in question\nhas not yet been determined.\n\nThe term *conjecture* refers to a statement which the speaker has reason\nto believe the statement is correct even though the speaker cannot prove\nthe statement. (Also, one should be warned about a common abuse of this\nterm. Even after a statement has been proven, sometimes it is still\nreferred to as a conjecture by force of habit.)\n\nThe difference between the terms *conjecture* and *open question* is\nthat the term *open* is neutral \u2014 saying that a statement is open does\nnot connote that the speaker is voicing an opinion regarding the truth\nor falsity of the statement.\n\nThe attachment below gives some examples of famous open problems in\nmathematics. is an external that contains more examples of open problems\nin mathematics.",
