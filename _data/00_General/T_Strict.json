  "definition": "In mathematical writing, the adjective *strict* is used in to modify\ntechnical which have meanings. It indicates that the exclusive meaning\nof the term is to be understood. (More formally, one could say that this\nis the meaning which implies the other meanings.)\n\nThis term is commonly used in the context of inequalities \u2014 the phrases\n\u201cstrictly less than\u201d and \u201cstrictly greater than\u201d mean \u201cless than and not\nequal to\u201d and \u201cgreater than and not equal to\u201d, respectively. A related\nuse occurs when comparing numbers to zero \u2014 \u201cstrictly positive\u201d and\n\u201cstrictly negative\u201d mean \u201cpositive and not equal to zero\u201d and \u201cnegative\nand not equal to zero\u201d, respectively. Also, in the context of functions,\nthe adverb \u201cstrictly \u201d is used to modify the terms \u201cmonotonic\u201d,\n\u201cincreasing\u201d, and \u201cdecreasing\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes one wants to specify the inclusive meanings\nof terms. In the context of comparisons, one can use the phrases\n\u201cnon-negative\u201d, \u201cnon-positive\u201d, \u201cnon-increasing\u201d, and \u201cnon-decreasing\u201d\nto make it clear that the inclusive sense of the terms is intended.\n\nUsing such terminology helps avoid possible ambiguity and confusion. For\ninstance, upon reading the phrase \u201cx is negative\u201d, it is not immediately\nclear whether x = 0 is possible, since some authors consider zero to be\npositive while others consider zero not to be positive. Therefore, it is\nprudent to write either \u201cx is strictly negative\u201d or \u201cx is non-positive\u201d\nunless the distinction is unimportant or the context makes obvious which\nmeaning is intended or it has been explicitly stated that the term\n\u201cpositive\u201d is to be used in only one sense. (Here, in Planet Math, we\nhave taken the third option by adopting the convention that zero is\nneither positive nor negative. Hence, the terms \u201cstrictly positive\u201d and\n\u201cpositive\u201d are synonyms here. However, the adverb \u201cstrictly\u201d may still\nbe necessary in some of the other contexts described avove.)",
