  "definition": "Some fonts have a [*text figures*]{} variant of the digits 0 to 9 where\nsome of them have ascenders and some have descenders so that they blend\nbetter with the general text. Here is Champernowne\u2019s constant $C_{10}$\nto 9 decimal places written in Georgia:\n\n![image](TextFiguresDemo)\n\nUsually, 6 and 8 have ascenders, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 have descenders. Since\nmost texts use base 10 numbers, and each digit usually occurs in about\nthe same proportion as the other digits, this means that numbers have\nvarying heights in just about the same propoertions as the words in the\ntext. Using text figures for base 3 numbers would result in numbers\nalways lacking in ascenders and descenders. For mathematical books and\npapers, however, text figures are generally eschewed.",
