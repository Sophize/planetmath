  "definition": "[*Graham\u2019s number*]{} $G$ is an upper bound in a problem in Ramsey\ntheory, first mentioned in a paper by Ronald Graham and B. Rothschild.\nThe [*Guinness Book of World Records*]{} calls it the largest number\never used in a mathematical proof. Graham\u2019s number is too difficult to\nwrite in scientific notation, so it is generally written using Knuth\u2019s\narrow-up notation. In Graham\u2019s paper, the bound is given as\n\n$$6 \\le N(2) \\le\nA(A(A(A(A(A(A(12,3),3),3),3),3),3),3),$$\n\nwhere $N(2)$ is the least natural number such that $n\\ge N(2)$ implies\nthat given any arbitrary $2$-coloring of the line segments between pairs\nof vertices of an $n$-dimensional box, there must exist a monochromatic\nrectangle in the box.\n\nHere $A$ is the function defined by (this is a direct quote):\n\n$$A(1,n) = 2^n, A(m,2) = 4,\\ m\\ge 1,\\ n\\ge 2, \\\\\nA(m,n) = A(m-1, A(m, n-1)),\\ m\\ge 2,\\ n\\ge 3.$$\n\nIn the earlier paper Graham and Rothschild called this function $F$\ninstead of $A$, and commented: \u201cClearly, there is some room for\nimprovement here.\u201d\n\nIn Knuth\u2019s arrow-up notation, Graham\u2019s number is still cumbersome to\nwrite: we define the recurrence relation\n$g_1 = 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3$ and\n$g_n = 3\\uparrow^{g_{n - 1}}3$. Graham\u2019s number is then $G = g_{64}$.\n\nTo help understand Graham\u2019s number from the more familiar viewpoint of\nstandard exponentiation, Wikipedia offers the following chart:\n\n$$g_1 \n= 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3 \n= 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow (3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow 3) \n= 3 \\uparrow \\uparrow \\uparrow \n  \\left( \n    \\begin{matrix} \n      \\underbrace{3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}} & \\  \\\\ \n      3^{3^3} & \\text{threes} \n    \\end{matrix}\n  \\right)\n= \\left.\n    \\begin{matrix}\n      \\underbrace{3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}} & \\  \\\\\n      \\underbrace{3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}} & \\text{threes} \\\\\n      \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n      \\underbrace{3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}} & \\text{threes}  \\\\\n      3^{3^3} & \\text{threes} \\\\\n    \\end{matrix}\n  \\right \\}\n  \\begin{matrix}\n    \\ & \\ \\\\\n    \\underbrace{3^{3^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{3}}}}}} & \\mbox{ layers} \\\\ \n    3^{3^3} & \\text{ threes}\n  \\end{matrix}$$\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the most significant base 10 digits of Graham\u2019s\nnumber are, but we do know that the least significant digit is 7 (and of\ncourse 0 in base 3).\n\nGraham\u2019s number has its own entry in Wells\u2019s [*Dictionary of Curious and\nInteresting Numbers*]{}, it is the very last entry, right after Skewes\u2019\nnumber, which it significantly dwarfs, and which was once also said to\nbe the largest number ever used in a serious mathematical proof.\n\n[2]{} M.
