  "definition": "An [*arrow*]{} is a line, usually straight, capped at one end, or both\nends, with an arrowhead which points in a specific direction. In a\nflowchart, arrows show the order in which instructions are to be\nperformed (including where branching may occur) or they show the flow of\ncause and effect. In certain arrangements of numbers, such as the\nCollatz tree, arrows show which numbers are the input values, with the\noutput value being pointed at by the arrowhead.\n\nIn writing about vectors, arrows can be written over the symbols for the\norigin and the endpoint, e.g., $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and\n$\\overleftarrow{CD}$. TeX provides commands for these.\n\nAn arrow, regarded as a morphism, functor or natural transformation also\nplays central roles in Category Theory and Categorical Dynamics.",
