  "definition": "[*Subtraction*]{} is a mathematical operation in which the value of a\nnumber is decreased by the values of one or more other numbers.\nSubtraction can be seen as a kind of addition with negative numbers. For\nexample, $7 - 4 = 7 + (-4) = 3$.\n\nThe usual operator looks like a dash: $-$. This operator is used in\nstandard infix notation as well as in Polish notation and reverse Polish\nnotation.\n\nBesides the possibility of overflow or underflow, subtraction presents\nno problems for fixed point arithmetic provided the operands are\nrepresentable in fixed point to begin with.",
