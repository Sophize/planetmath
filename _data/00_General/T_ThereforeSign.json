  "definition": "The [*therefore sign*]{} \u201c$\\therefore$\u201d is used especially in\nhandwritten mathematical text as a shorthand of the or relations:\n$$S_1 \\quad \\therefore \\; S_2$$ It expresses that $S_2$ has been\ninferred from $S_1$ or from $S_1$ and some preceding facts. The sign is\nrather a punctuation mark than a symbol of logical implication.\nGrammatically, it could be characterised a conclusive coordinating . The\nusage of the symbol is not mathematically well-defined, and it often\nmeans \u2018we can conclude in context\u2019 or \u2018we can conclude from statements\nalready shown or assumed to be true\u2019.\\\nFor example, in determining an angle of a right triangle, one may write\n$$\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\therefore \\; \\alpha = 30^\\circ$$ Here,\n\u201c$\\therefore$\u201d does not a proper implication \u201c$\\Rightarrow$\u201d, since the\nexact implication here would be\n$$\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\;\\, \\Leftarrow \\;\\, \\alpha = 30^\\circ.$$ To\nobtain a strict implication, we would need to introduce some of the\ncontext. For instance, we know that, since $\\alpha$ is an angle of a\nright triangle, $0^\\circ \\le \\alpha \\le 90^\\circ$, so what we wrote\ncould be interpreted as the implication\n$$\\sin\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\; \\land \\;\n  0^\\circ \\le \\alpha \\le 90^\\circ\n  \\;\\, \\Rightarrow \\;\\, \\alpha = 30^\\circ.$$",
