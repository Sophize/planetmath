  "definition": "[*Grapher*]{} is a software graphing calculator that comes bundled with\nthe Apple Mac OS Xoperating system. It can graph 2-dimensional equations\nlike $y = \\sin x$, as well as 3-dimensional equations like\n$z = \\frac{y^3}{x^2 + y^2}$ (Cartan\u2019s umbrella, illustrated below).\n\n![image](C:TempGrapherScreenShot)\n\nEquations to be graphed can be entered in Cartesian form or in\nparametric form, polar coordinates, logarithmic, etc. The program\nautomatically \u201ctypesets\u201d the formulas as they are entered, for example,\nconverting `x^2` to $x^2$ or `1/x` to $\\frac{1}{x}$. The program can\ncreate animations, and one can also move a graph or rotate it (just by\ndragging it, for 3D graphs; for 2D graphs one must first select the Move\nTool).\n\nIn a default installation, the program is in the Utilities subfolder of\nthe Applications folder. Mac OS 9 had a similar program, called Graphing\nCalculator, which was also capable of graphing 2D and 3D equations as\nwell as animations.\n\n[2]{} Maria Langer, [*Visual Quickstart Guide: Mac OS 9.1*]{}.
