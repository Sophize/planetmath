  "definition": "A [*percentage*]{} is a ratio expressed in terms of a unit being 100. A\npercentage is usually denoted by the symbol \u201c%.\u201d For example, $20\\%$ of\n$\\$700.47$ is $\\$175.12$ (using fixed point arithmetic to two decimal\nplaces for display).\n\nOn most calculators, one sure way to calculate a percentage is by\nentering a decimal point before the desired percentage and multiplying\nthat by the amount one wishes to calculate the percentage of. Some\ncalculators have a percentage key.\n\nWhen tipping at most restaurants in the United States, it is customary\nto tip 15% of the check to the waiter for parties of as much as four\npeople. One common shortcut is to divide by 10 (by moving the decimal\npoint to the left) and then add half of that amount.\n\nNote that the percentage symbol % (Shift-5 in most American keyboard\nlayouts) is overloaded in TeX as a comment start indicator and in\nMathematica as a shortcut for referring to the previous output.",
