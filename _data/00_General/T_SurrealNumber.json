  "definition": "The surreal numbers are a generalization of the reals. Each surreal\nnumber consists of two parts (called the left and right), each of which\nis a set of surreal numbers. For any surreal number $N$, these parts can\nbe called $N_L$ and $N_R$. (This could be viewed as an ordered pair of\nsets, however the surreal numbers were intended to be a basis for\nmathematics, not something to be embedded in set theory.) A surreal\nnumber is written $N=\\langle N_L\\mid N_R\\rangle$.\n\nNot every number of this form is a surreal number. The surreal numbers\nsatisfy two additional properties. First, if $x\\in N_R$ and $y\\in N_L$\nthen $x\\nleq y$. Secondly, they must be well founded. These properties\nare both satisfied by the following construction of the surreal numbers\nand the $\\leq$ relation by mutual induction:\n\n$\\langle\\mid\\rangle$, which has both left and right parts empty, is $0$.\n\nGiven two (possibly empty) sets of surreal numbers $R$ and $L$ such that\nfor any $x\\in R$ and $y\\in L$, $x\\nleq y$, $\\langle L\\mid R\\rangle$.\n\nDefine $N\\leq M$ if there is no $x\\in N_L$ such that $M\\leq x$ and no\n$y\\in M_R$ such that $y\\leq N$.\n\nThis process can be continued transfinitely, to define infinite and\ninfinitesimal numbers. For instance if $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of\nintegers then $\\omega=\\langle \\mathbb{Z}\\mid \\rangle$. Note that this\ndoes not make equality the same as identity:\n$\\langle 1\\mid 1\\rangle=\\langle \\mid\\rangle$, for instance.\n\nIt can be shown that $N$ is \u201csandwiched\u201d between the elements of $N_L$\nand $N_R$: it is larger than any element of $N_L$ and smaller than any\nelement of $N_R$.\n\nAddition of surreal numbers is defined by\n\n$$N+M=\\langle \\{N+x\\mid x\\in M_L\\}\\cup\\{M+x\\mid y\\in N_L\\}\\mid \\{N+x\\mid x\\in M_R\\}\\cup\\{M+x\\mid y\\in N_R\\}\\rangle$$\n\nIt follows that $-N=\\langle -N_R\\mid -N_L\\rangle$.\n\nThe definition of multiplication can be written more easily by defining\n$M\\cdot  N_L=\\{M\\cdot x\\mid x\\in N_L\\}$ and similarly for $N_R$.\n\nThen\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nN\\cdot M=&\\langle M\\cdot N_L+N\\cdot M_L-N_L\\cdot M_L,M\\cdot N_R+N\\cdot M_R-N_R\\cdot M_R\\mid \\\\\n&M\\cdot N_L+N\\cdot M_R-N_L\\cdot M_R,M\\cdot N_R+N\\cdot M_L-N_R\\cdot M_L\\rangle\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe surreal numbers satisfy the axioms for a field under addition and\nmultiplication (whether they really are a field is complicated by the\nfact that they are too large to be a set).\n\nThe integers of surreal mathematics are called the *omnific integers*.\nIn general positive integers $n$ can always be written\n$\\langle n-1\\mid\\rangle$ and so\n$-n=\\langle \\mid 1-n\\rangle=\\langle \\mid (-n)+1\\rangle$. So for instance\n$1=\\langle 0\\mid\\rangle$.\n\nIn general, $\\langle a\\mid b\\rangle$ is the simplest number between $a$\nand $b$. This can be easily used to define the dyadic fractions: for any\ninteger $a$, $a+\\frac{1}{2}=\\langle a\\mid a+1\\rangle$. Then\n$\\frac{1}{2}=\\langle 0\\mid 1\\rangle$,\n$\\frac{1}{4}=\\langle 0\\mid \\frac{1}{2}\\rangle$, and so on. This can then\nbe used to locate non-dyadic fractions by pinning them between a left\npart which gets infinitely close from below and a right part which gets\ninfinitely close from above.\n\nOrdinal arithmetic can be defined starting with $\\omega$ as defined\nabove and adding numbers such as $\\langle \\omega\\mid\\rangle=\\omega+1$\nand so on. Similarly, a starting infinitesimal can be found as\n$\\langle 0\\mid 1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4}\\ldots\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\omega}$,\nand again more can be developed from there.",
