Therefore, this entry is best viewed using page mode.\n\nA *Venn diagram* is a visual tool used in describing how two or more\nsets are logically related to one another. The simplest example is a\nVenn diagram for two sets. Each set is represented by a planar region\nbounded by a circle, so that the two regions overlap. In the diagram\nbelow, set $A$ is represented by the reddish circular disc and set $B$\nis represented by the bluish circular disc:\n\n(0,0)(6,4) (2,2)[2]{} (4,2)[2]{} (1,2)[$A$]{} (3,2)[$A\\cap B$]{}\n(5,2)[$B$]{} (0,0)[$.$]{} (6,4)[$.$]{}\n\nThe overlapping region represents the intersection of the sets $A$ and\n$B$, denoted by $A\\cap B$.\n\nTypically, the two sets are subsets of some bigger set $U$, called a\nuniverse. Therefore, the corresponding Venn diagram above is shown to be\nsitting inside a larger rectangular region representing the universe:\n\n(0,0)(8,6) (0,0)(8,0)(8,6)(0,6) (3,3)[2]{} (5,3)[2]{} (2,3)[$2$]{}\n(4,3)[$1$]{} (6,3)[$3$]{} (7,5)[$4$]{} (8.5,5.75)[$U$]{} (0,0)[$.$]{}\n(8,6)[$.$]{}\n\nNotice that the region representing the universe $U$ is partitioned into\n$4$ mutually exclusive regions:\n\n   Region        Set being represented          Symbol\n  -------- --------------------------------- -------------\n    $1$     the intersection of $A$ and $B$    $A\\cap B$\n    $2$            $A$ excluding $B$          $A\\cap B'$\n    $3$            $B$ excluding $A$          $A'\\cap B$\n    $4$           neither $A$ nor $B$         $A'\\cap B'$\n\nA Venn diagram for three sets is slightly more complicated, and is\nillustrated below:\n\n(0,0)(8,7.75) (0,0)(8,0)(8,7.75)(0,7.75) (3,3)[2]{} (5,3)[2]{}\n(4,4.75)[2]{} (2,2.5)[$1$]{} (4,2)[$2$]{} (6,2.5)[$3$]{} (2.75,4)[$4$]{}\n(4,3.5)[$5$]{} (5.25,4)[$6$]{} (4,5.5)[$7$]{} (6.5,6.25)[$8$]{}\n(8.5,7.5)[$U$]{} (0,0)[$.$]{} (8,7.75)[$.$]{}\n\nAs indicated by the diagram, $U$ is divided into $8$ regions. The $8$\nregions represent the following sets (where $A,B,C$ are sets represented\nby circular discs Red, Blue, Yellow, respectively):\n\n   Region          Set          Region         Set          Region          Set          Region          Set\n  -------- ------------------- -------- ------------------ -------- ------------------- -------- --------------------\n    $1$     $A\\cap B'\\cap C'$    $2$     $A\\cap B\\cap C'$    $3$     $A'\\cap B\\cap C'$    $4$      $A\\cap B'\\cap C$\n    $5$      $A\\cap B\\cap C$     $6$     $A'\\cap B\\cap C$    $7$     $A'\\cap B'\\cap C$    $8$     $A'\\cap B'\\cap C'$\n\nMore generally, a Venn diagram may be constructed for any finite number\nof sets, and the regions representing the sets need not be circular\ndiscs, as long as each region is the interior of a simple closed curve\n(in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$). Specifically, a Venn diagram $V$ for $n$\nsets is a set of $n$ simple closed curves $C_1,\\ldots, C_n$ in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that\n$$A_1(k_1)\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n(k_n) \\ne \\varnothing$$ for every\ncombination of $(k_1,\\ldots,k_n)$, where each\n$k_i\\in \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, and that $A_i(0)$ is the region $A_i$\nbounded by $C_i$, and $A_i(1)$ is $A_i'$, the complement of $A_i$ in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. In a nutshell, this says that the curves\n$C_1,\\ldots,C_n$ partition $\\mathbb{R}^2$ into $2^n$ non-empty regions.\nThis is in fact possible for every $n<\\infty$. Furthermore, if we treat\na straight line as a circle whose center is located at $\\infty$, the\npossibility of constructing a Venn diagram for $n$ sets is the same as\nsaying the possibility of constructing $n$ straight lines in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the lines partition the plane into $2^n$\nregions.\n\n**Remark**. Note that given a Venn diagram for $n$ sets, no assumptions\nare made concerning these $n$ sets, although it is generally assumed\nthat the logical structure of these sets correspond to the logical\nstructure of the regions bounded by the closed curves in the Venn\ndiagram. For example, it is possible that $A\\cap B=\\varnothing$, or that\n$A\\subseteq B$. A Venn diagram for both examples would look the same,\nalthough $A\\cap B$ represents $\\varnothing$ in the former case, and $A$\nin the latter one.",
