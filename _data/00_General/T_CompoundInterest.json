  "definition": "Suppose a bank account is opened at time $0$ and $M_0$ is deposited into\nthe account. A *compound interest* on the account is interest that is\nearned according to the following procedure:\n\n1.  it is payable at the end of time periods $t,2t,\\ldots$, where $t>0$\n    is the length of the first time interval (1 for 1 month, 12 for 1\n    year, etc...)\n\n2.  the interest earned at the end of each time period is a fixed\n    percentage $r$ of the principal at the beginning of the time period\n\n3.  the interest earned at the end of the time period is added to the\n    principal at the beginning of the time period, the total of which is\n    the principal at the beginning of the next time period\n\nThe following table illustrates the structure of the compound interest.\n\n   time period    principal         interest              interest accrued\n  ------------- -------------- ------------------- ------------------------------\n       $0$          $M_0$              $0$                      $0$\n       $t$        $M_0(r+1)$         $M_0r$                    $M_0r$\n      $2t$       $M_0(r+1)^2$      $M_0(r+1)r$            $M_0r+M_0r(r+1)$\n      $3t$       $M_0(r+1)^3$     $M_0(r+1)^2r$     $M_0r+M_0r(r+1)+M_0r(r+1)^2$\n    $\\vdots$       $\\vdots$         $\\vdots$                  $\\vdots$\n      $nt$       $M_0(r+1)^n$   $M_0(r+1)^{n-1}r$     $M_0\\big[(r+1)^n-1\\big]$\n\nFrom the table, we see that the \u201ctotal\u201d interest $i(nt)$ earned\n(accrued) at the end of time $nt$ is $M_0\\big[(r+1)^n-1 \\big]$.\nFurthermore, the principal \u201ccompounds\u201d, or \u201cgrows\u201d exponentially. If the\naccount is closed and the money withdrawn at the end of $nt$, and the\ntotal amount of money received is $$M(nt)=M_0(r+1)^n.$$\n\nThe interest rate associated with the compound interest as presented\nabove between two time periods, say $at$ and $bt$, is rather complicated\n$$r(at,bt)=\\frac{1}{M_0}\\frac{i(bt)-i(at)}{bt-at}=\\frac{(r+1)^b-(r+1)^a}{(b-a)t}.$$\n\nThe effective interest rate has the following form:\n$$\\operatorname{eff.}r(at,bt)=\\frac{1}{M(at)}\\frac{i(bt)-i(at)}{bt-at}=\\frac{(r+1)^{(b-a)}-1}{(b-a)t},$$\nwhich means that $\\operatorname{eff.}r$ depends only on $r,t$ (which are\nconstants), and most importantly, $b-a$, the difference between the two\ntime periods. If $b=a+1$ and $t$ is normalized to $1$, then the\neffective interest rate takes on a particularly simple form:\n$$\\operatorname{eff.}r(at,bt)=r.$$\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   More generally, we say that an interest is a *compound interest* if\n    its effective interest rate between two time periods $t_1$ and $t_2$\n    depends only on $t_2-t_1$. If we set $t_1=t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and\n    $t_2=t+1$, solving\n    $$\\operatorname{eff.}r(t_1,t_2):=\\frac{1}{M(t_1)} \\frac{M(t_2)-M(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}$$\n    for $M(t+1)$, we get\n    $M(t+1)=M(t)\\big(\\operatorname{eff.}r(t,t+1)+1\\big)$. But\n    $$r:=\\operatorname{eff.}r(0,1)=\\cdots =\\operatorname{eff.}r(t,t+1),$$\n    we have $M(t+1)=M(t)(r+1)$, or $M(t) = M_0(r+1)^t$ by induction.\n\n-   An interest is said to be *compounded continuously* if it is\n    differentiable with respect to time $t$ and its instantaneous\n    effective interest rate is a constant $r$. If we solve the\n    corresponding differential equation (with respect to instantaneous\n    effective interest rate), we see that for a continously compounded\n    interest, $$M(t)=Me^{rt}.$$ The effective interest rate of a\n    continuously compounded interest is\n    $$\\frac{1}{M(t_1)}\\frac{M(t_2)-M(t_1)}{t_2-t_1} =\\frac{1}{Me^{rt_1}}\\frac{Me^{rt_2}-Me^{rt_1}}{r_2-r_1} =\\frac{e^{r(t_2-t_1)}-1}{r_2-r_1}.$$\n    Since it is a function of $r_2-r_1$, interest compounded\n    continuously is a compounded interest.\n\n-   In practice, compound rates are often quoted annually, even the\n    compounding may be monthly, or semi-annually, or even continuously.\n    For example, $6\\%$ annual interest rate compounded monthly means\n    $0.5\\% (=6\\%/12)$ is compounded every month. The annual effective\n    interest rate in this case is $(1+0.5\\%)^{12}-1\\approx 6.17\\%$. So\n    what is the annual effective interest rate of a $6\\%$ annual\n    interest rate compounded continuously? It is the following:\n    $$\\operatorname{eff.}r=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} (1+\\frac{6\\%}{n})^n-1=e^{6\\%}-1\\approx 6.18\\%.$$",
