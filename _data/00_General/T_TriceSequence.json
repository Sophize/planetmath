  "definition": "The [*Trice sequence*]{} consists of the nine numbers 21, 36, 55, 60,\n67, 68, 92, 93, 125 in ascending order. It was published in Clifford\nPickover\u2019s [*Mazes of the Mind*]{} in 1992 and added to the On-Line\nEncyclopedia of Integer Sequences early on in its history (see A001491),\nbut for years people couldn\u2019t figure out what the sequence was because\nmost of them were searching for a mathematical explanation. The first\nthree numbers are both triangular and hexagonal, but none of the\nfollowing numbers are. According to Neil Sloane, \u201cthis was a mystery for\nmany years; even Clifford Pickover could not recall the explanation .\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1998 that Derek Holt identified the sequence and let\nSloane know that it consists of the opus numbers of Beethoven\u2019s nine\nsymphonies.",
