  "definition": "The [*Mac OS Calculator*]{} is a software calculator that comes bundled\nwith the Apple Mac OS operating system. As late as Mac OS 9, the\nCalculator was a very basic calculator with only the arithmetic\noperations. In Mac OS X, the Calculator program was upgraded, with not\njust the addition of Scientific mode (a scientific calculator) but also\nProgrammer mode with functions useful for computer programmers, such as\nUnicode character lookup by numerical value. The currently displayed\nvalue is not lost at a change of mode.\n\nLike the Windows Calculator, for the Mac OS Calculator $0^0 = 1$.\n\n[1]{} Maria Langer, [*Mac OS 8: Visual Quickstart Guide*]{} Berkeley:\nPeachpit Press (1997): 108",
