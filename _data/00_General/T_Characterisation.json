  "definition": "In mathematics, [*characterisation*]{} usually means a property or a\ncondition to define a certain notion. A notion may, under some\npresumptions, have different ways to define it.\n\nFor example, let $R$ be a commutative ring with non-zero unity (the\npresumption). Then the following are equivalent:\n\n\\(1) All finitely generated regular ideals of $R$ are invertible.\n\n\\(2) The $(a,\\,b)(c,\\,d) = (ac,\\,bd,\\,(a+b)(c+d))$ for multiplying ideals\nof $R$ is valid always when at least one of the elements $a$, $b$, $c$,\n$d$ of $R$ is not zero-divisor.\n\n\\(3) Every overring of $R$ is integrally closed.\n\nEach of these conditions is sufficient (and necessary) for\ncharacterising and defining the Pr\u00fcfer ring.",
