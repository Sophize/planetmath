  "definition": "In mathematics, a *pathological object* is mathematical object that has\na highly unexpected .\n\nPathological objects are typically percieved to, in some sense, be badly\nbehaving. On the other hand, they are perfectly properly defined\nmathematical objects. Therefore this \u201cbad behaviour\u201d can simply be seen\nas a contradiction with our intuitive picture of how a certain object\nshould behave.\n\n### Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n\n-   A very famous pathological function is the Weierstrass function,\n    which is a continuous function that is nowhere differentiable.\n\n-   The Peano space filling curve. This pathological curve maps the unit\n    interval $[0,1]$ continuously onto $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$.\n\n-   The Cantor set. This is subset of the interval $[0,1]$ has the\n    pathological property that it is uncountable yet its measure is\n    zero.\n\n-   The Dirichlet\u2019s function from ${\\mathbbmss{R}}$ to ${\\mathbbmss{R}}$\n    is continuous at every irrational point and discontinuous at every\n    rational point.\n\n-   Ackermann Function.\n\nSee also [@wiki].\n\n[9]{} Wikipedia .",
