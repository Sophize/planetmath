  "definition": "A [*superscript*]{} is a symbol or group of symbols written above, and\nusually a bit to the right, of another symbol or group of symbols in\norder to show a relation among the two. The most common use of\nsuperscripts in mathematics is for notating exponentiation. For example,\nin the expression $4^7$, the 7 is a superscript to the 4. Iterated sum\nand product notation also uses superscripts most of the time, to show\nthe iterator end values, and the same goes for integral notation.\nNotation of iterated functions also benefit from using superscripts to\ncut down on nested parentheses, e.g., $f^3(x) = f(f(f(x)))$; examples of\niterated functions include the iterated totient function $\\phi^i(n)$ and\niterated sum of divisors function $\\sigma^i(n)$. The contravariant\nindices of tensors are also denoted by superscripts.\n\nNonfiction literature in general uses number superscripts to indicate\nfootnotes with the corresponding numbers. This usage is often avoided in\nmathematical books and papers to prevent possible confusion with\nexponentiation.",
