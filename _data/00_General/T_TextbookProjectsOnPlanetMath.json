  "definition": "This will be a guide to textbook projects on PM. Since I don\u2019t know if\nthere currently are any textbook projects on PM, this is just a \u201cstub\u201d\nentry for now. If you create a textbook project, please add a link to it\nhere. Let me know what other things you would like to see as part of\nthis entry. (Eventually we will probably create a documentation item for\ntextbook writing.) I think the 00-01 category can and should contain\narticles *about* instructional exposition, just as well as examples of\ninstructional exposition, so perhaps such discussions can begin here as\nwell, and then branch off into other entries as that becomes convenient.\n\nAn example of the sort of textbook we might want to have would be: a\nfree book comparable to *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen *et al.*.\n\n-   Statistics on PlanetMath",
