It is used before a set of equivalent conditions (each\nimplies all the others).\n\nIn a definition, when one of the conditions is somehow \u201cbetter\u201d\n(simpler, shorter, ...), it makes sense to phrase the definition with\nthat condition, and mention that the others are equivalent. \u201cTFAE\u201d is\ntypically used when none of the conditions can take priority over the\nothers. Actually proving the claimed equivalence must, of course, be\ndone separately.",
