  "definition": "A *toy theorem* is a simplified version of a more general theorem. For\ninstance, by introducing some simplifying assumptions in a theorem, one\nobtains a toy theorem.\n\nUsually, a toy theorem is used to illustrate the claim of a theorem. It\ncan also be illustrative and insightful to study proofs of a toy theorem\nderived from a non-trivial theorem. Toy theorems also have a great\neducation value. After presenting a theorem (with, say, a highly\nnon-trivial proof), one can sometimes give some assurance that the\ntheorem really holds, by proving a toy version of the theorem.\n\nFor instance, a toy theorem of the Brouwer fixed point theorem is\nobtained by restricting the dimension to one. In this case, the Brouwer\nfixed point theorem follows almost immediately from the intermediate\nvalue theorem (see ).",
