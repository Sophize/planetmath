  "definition": "Mathematicians use phrases like \u201cit is obvious that\u201d, \u201cit is easy to see\nthat\u201d, \u201cit is clear that\u201d, and \u201cis trivial\u201d to indicate that some steps\nhave been omitted. The use of such language may be classified under\nthree headings \u2014 honest, dishonest, and pedagogical.\n\nThe honest use of these phrases occurs when only a few steps have been\nomitted and these steps are simple enough that the average reader can\neasily fill in the gaps. Omitting such steps can be beneficial because\nit cuts down the length of an exposition and keeps the main ideas from\ngetting lost amidst a morass of boring details and routine operations.\nBy reminding the reader of small omissions in an unobtrusive fashion,\nsuch phrases help put the reader at ease \u2014 if they are left out, it is\neasy for the reader to be thrown off-course by a missing step or be left\nwith an uneasy feeling that there might be a hole in a proof.\n\nThe dishonest use of these phrases occurs when a somewhat lengthy\ncalculation has been left out because the author was too lazy to write\nit down. By using these phrases, the author hopes to intimidate\npotential critics from pointing out that material is missing by\ninsinuating that anyone who would point out that something is missing is\ntoo stupid to fill in a few obvious steps. Frequent dishonest use of\nthese terms may be a symptom of mathematheosis.\n\nThe pedagogical use of these phrases occurs when the author has\ndeliberately left the filling-in of missing steps as an exercise to the\nreader.",
