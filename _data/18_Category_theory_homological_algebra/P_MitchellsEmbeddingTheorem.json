  "statement": "Every small abelian category admits an and into the category\n**$\\mbox{Mod}_R$** of (left) modules over some ring $R$.\n\nAs a consequence, this theorem says that certain facts about small\nabelian categories can be proved in the more concrete setting of\n$\\mbox{Mod}_R$ (indeed a concrete category). For example, in order to\nprove that a sequence is exact in an abelian category, it is enough to\nprove it in the context of $\\mbox{Mod}_R$, by realizing the fact that\nobjects in $\\mbox{Mod}_R$ are sets (with structures) and utilizing the\nelements therein. In particular, the diagram chasing technique popular\nin homological algebra may be formulated in small abelian categories as\na result of this theorem.\n\n[9]{} F.
