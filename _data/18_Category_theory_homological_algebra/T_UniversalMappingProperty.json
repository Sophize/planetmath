  "definition": "Introduction.\n=============\n\nA strong attribute of categories is a uniform description of many\nseemingly unrelated concepts from diverse interest areas of mathematics.\nFor example, Cartesian products produce new sets from old just as direct\nproduct produce new groups from old and Cartesian products of topologies\nare again topologies. To make these notions uniform one can provide\ncategorical definitions. Because categories assume as their constituents\nonly abstract objects and morphisms, all the properties of such\nconstructions must be given as properties of morphisms between objects.\nThose constructions which can be characterized by means of the existence\nof a *unique* morphism are generally grouped under the heading of\n*universal mapping properties* [@Hungerford p. 57]. A precise definition\nwill follow below.\n\nAs is common with category theory, there are generally not many theorems\nthat can be proved at a categorical level and set to apply to all\nuniversal mapping properties. The exception is a generic proof of\nuniqueness of objects with a universal mapping property. It should be\nemphasized that most universal mapping properties are a result of the\nunderlying structure of the categories in question and not provided for\nabstract reasons. (For concrete examples consider the construction of\nfree groups or free Lie algebras.)\n\nThere are contingents that use the phrase *universal property*\nespecially in the vernacular. Mac Lane does so in passing but his use is\nnot as a defined term but rather as an intuitive concept to be refined\nto a strict definition later [@MacLane p. 2]\n\nBecause the property applies to the uniqueness of mappings the title\n*universal mapping property* remains the choice of most mathematical\nreferences in print. Authors interested in shorter titles will sometimes\nsubstitute Mac Lane\u2019s concept of *universal arrows*[@MacLane III.1] \u2013 a\nrigorous definition which will be explained below and captures the\nspirit of the universal mapping property as presently described. The\npreferred term of morphism for arrow motivates the modern title\n*universal morphism*.\n\nUniversal mapping properties arise in such constructions as: direct\nproducts and direct sums, free groups, free algebras, product topology,\nStone-\u010cech compactification, tensor product, exterior algebra, inverse\nand direct limit, pullbacks and pushouts.\n\nUniversal Morphisms and the Universal Mapping Property\n======================================================\n\nWe follow [@MacLane III.1] for our treatment of universal arrows and\nuniversal mapping properties.\n\nLet $U: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ be a functor from a category\n$\\mathcal{D}$ to a category $\\mathcal{C}$, and let $X$ be an object of\n$\\mathcal{C}$. A *universal morphism* from $X$ to $U$ consists of a pair\n$(A, \\phi)$ where $A$ is an object of $\\mathcal{D}$ and\n$\\phi : X \\to U(A)$ is a morphism in $\\mathcal{C}$, such that the\nfollowing *universal mapping property* is satisfied:\n\n> Whenever $Y$ is an object of $\\mathcal{D}$ and $f \\colon X \\to U(Y)$\n> is a morphism in $\\mathcal{C}$, then there exists a **unique**\n> morphism $g:A\\to Y$ such that the following diagram commutes.\n>\n> $$\\xymatrix{\n>                          & U(A)\\ar[dd] &  A\\ar@{-->}[dd]^g\\\\\n>          X\\ar[ur]^{\\phi}\\ar[dr]_f &            &            \\\\\n>                          & U(Y)        & Y.           \n>     }$$\n\nThe existence of the morphism g intuitively expresses the fact that $A$\nis \u201cgeneral enough\u201d, while the uniqueness of the morphism ensures that\n$A$ is \u201cnot too general\u201d.\n\nOne can also consider the categorical dual of the above definition by\nreversing all the arrows. Let $F:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{D}$ be a\nfunctor, and let $X$ be an object of $\\mathcal{D}$. A co-universal\nmorphism from $F$ to $X$ consists of a pair $(A, \\phi)$ where $A$ is an\nobject of $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\phi:F(A) \\to X$ is a morphism in\n$\\mathcal{D}$, such that the following universal mapping property is\nsatisfied:\n\n> Whenever $Y$ is an object of $\\mathcal{C}$ and $f \\colon F(Y) \\to X$\n> is a morphism in $\\mathcal{D}$, then there exists a **unique**\n> morphism $g \\colon Y \\to A$ such that the following diagram commutes.\n>\n> $$\\xymatrix{\n>          Y\\ar@{-->}[dd]^g & F(Y)\\ar[dd]^{F(g)}\\ar[rd]^f & \\\\\n>            &      &  X.\\\\\n>          A & F(A)\\ar[ur]_{\\phi} &     \n>     }$$\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, some authors may call one of these constructions a\nuniversal morphism and the other one a co-universal morphism.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n#### Existence and uniqueness.\n\nDefining a quantity does not guarantee its existence. Given a functor\n$U$ and an object $X$ as above, there may or may not exist a universal\nmorphism from $X$ to $U$ (or from $U$ to $X$). If, however, a universal\nmorphism $(A, \\phi)$ does exists, then it is unique up to a unique\nisomorphism. That is, if $(A', \\phi')$ is another such pair then there\nexists a unique isomorphism $g \\colon A \\to A'$ such that\n$\\phi' = U(g)\\phi$. This is easily seen by substituting $(A', \\phi')$\nfor $(Y, f)$ in the definition of the universal mapping property.\n\n#### Equivalent formulations.\n\nThe definition of a universal morphism can be rephrased in a variety of\nways. Let $U$ be a functor from $\\mathcal{D}$ to $\\mathcal{C}$, and let\n$X$ be an object of $\\mathcal{C}$. Then the following statements are\nequivalent\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is a universal morphism from $X$ to $U$;\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is an initial object of the comma category $(X\n      \\downarrow U)$;\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is a representable functor of\n    ${\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathcal{C}}(X,U(-))$.\n\nThe dual statements are also equivalent\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is a universal morphism from $F$ to $X$;\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is a terminal object of the comma category $(F\n      \\downarrow X)$;\n\n-   $(A, \\phi)$ is a representable functor|representation of\n    ${\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathcal{C}}(F(-),X)$.\n\n#### Relation to adjoint functors.\n\nSuppose that $(A_1, \\phi_1)$ is a universal morphism from $X_1$ to $U$\nand that $(A_2,\\phi_2)$ is also a universal morphism from $X_2$ to $U$.\nBy the universal mapping property, given any morphism\n$h \\colon X_1 \\to X_2$ there exists a unique morphism\n$g \\colon A_1 \\to A_2$ such that the following diagram commutes\n\n$$\\xymatrix{\n     X_1\\ar[r]^{\\phi_1}\\ar[d]_h & U(A_1)\\ar[d]_{U(g)} & A_1\\ar@{-->}[d]^g \\\\\n     X_2\\ar[r]_{\\phi_2} & U(A_2) & A_2 \\\\\n   }$$\n\nIf **every** object $X_i$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ admits a universal morphism\nto $U$, then the assignment $X_i\\mapsto A_i$ and $h \\mapsto g$ defines a\nfunctor $V\\colon \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$. The maps $\\phi_i$ then\ndefine a natural transformation from $1_{\\mathcal{C}}$ (the identity\nfunctor on $\\mathcal{C}$) to $U\nV$. The functors $(V, U)$ are then a pair of adjoint functors, with $V$\nleft-adjoint to $U$. Similar statements apply to the dual situation of\nmorphisms from $U$. If such morphisms exist for every $X\\in \\mathcal{C}$\none obtains a functor $V \\colon \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ which is\nright-adjoint to $U$.\n\nIndeed, all pairs of adjoint functors arise from universal constructions\nin this manner. Let $F$ and $G$ be a pair of adjoint functors with unit\n$\\eta$ and co-unit $\\epsilon$ (see the article on adjoint functors for\nthe definitions). Then we have a universal morphism for each object in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n-   For each object $X\\in\\mathcal{C}$, the pair $(F(X), \\eta_X)$ is a\n    universal morphism from $X$ to $G$. That is, for all $f \\colon X \\to\n      G(Y)$, there exists a unique $g \\colon F(X) \\to Y$ for which the\n    diagrams below commute.\n\n-   Dually, for each object $Y \\in \\mathcal{D}$, the pair\n    $(G(Y),\\epsilon_Y)$ is a universal morphism from $F$ to $Y$. That\n    is, for all $g \\colon F(X) \\to Y$ there exists a unique\n    $f \\colon X \\to\n      G(Y)$ for which the following diagrams commute.\n\n    $$\\xymatrix{\n               & GF(X)\\ar[dd]^{G(g)}     &  F(X)\\ar[dd]^{F(f)}\\ar[dr]^g  \\\\\n            X\\ar[ur]^{\\eta_X}\\ar[dr]_f  & &  & Y      \\\\\n               & G(Y)  & FG(Y)\\ar[ur]_{\\epsilon_Y}\n        }$$\n\nUniversal constructions are more general than adjoint functor pairs. A\nuniversal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to\nan adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every\nobject of $\\mathcal{C}$ (equivalently, for every object of\n$\\mathcal{D}$).\n\nExamples\n========\n\n#### Tensor algebras.\n\nLet ${\\operatorname{\\mathit{K}-Vect}}$ be the category of vector spaces\nover a field $K$, and let ${\\operatorname{\\mathit{K}-Alg}}$ be the\ncategory of $K$-algebras (assumed to be unital and associative). Let $U$\nbe the forgetful functor which assigns to each algebra its underlying\nvector space. Given any vector space $V$ over $K$ we can construct the\ntensor algebra $T(V)$ of $V$. The universal mapping property of the\ntensor algebra expresses the fact that the pair $(T(V), \\iota)$, where\n$\\iota \\colon V \\to T(V)$ is the natural inclusion map, is a universal\nmorphism from $V$ to $U$. Since this construction works for any vector\nspace $V$, we conclude that $T$ is a functor from\n${\\operatorname{\\mathit{K}-Vect}}$ to ${\\operatorname{\\mathit{K}-Alg}}$.\nThis functor is left-adjoint to the forgetful functor $U$.\n\n#### Kernels.\n\nSuppose $\\mathcal{C}$ is a category with zero morphisms\n$0_{AB}\\in{\\operatorname{Hom}}_{\\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ (such as the category\nof groups) and let $f \\colon X \\to Y$ be a morphism in $\\mathcal{C}$. A\nkernel of $f$ is any morphism $k\\colon K \\to X$ such that\n\n-   the composition $f k$ is the zero morphism from $K$ to $Y$;\n\n-   given any morphism $k'\\colon K' \\to X$ such that $f k'$ is the zero\n    morphism, there is a unique morphism $u\\colon K' \\to K$ such that\n    $k u = k'$.\n\nTo understand this in the framework of the general setting above, we let\n$\\mathcal{D}$ be the category of morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$. The objects\nof $\\mathcal{D}$ are morphisms $f \\colon X \\to Y$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, and\na morphism from $f\n\\colon X \\to Y$ to $g \\colon S \\to T$ is a commutative square whose\nsides are a pair of morphisms $\\alpha \\colon X \\to S$ and $\\beta\n\\colon Y \\to T$. Diagramatically, $$\\xymatrix{\n   X\\ar[r]^f\\ar[d]_{\\alpha} & Y\\ar[d]^{\\beta} \\\\\n   S\\ar[r]^g  & T\n}$$\n\nLet $F \\colon \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ be the functor that maps an\nobject $K\\in\\mathcal{C}$ to the zero morphism\n$0_{\\scriptscriptstyle KK} \\colon K \\to\nK $, and that maps a morphism $r \\colon K \\to L$ to the trivial square\nwith sides $(r,0_{KL})$. Now, let $f$ be an object $\\mathcal{D}$ (which\nis the same thing as a morphism $f \\colon X \\to\nY$ in the category $\\mathcal{C}$). A kernel $k\\colon K\\to X$, if it\nexists, is the same thing as an object $K\\in \\mathcal{C}$ and a morphism\n$(k,0)$ in $\\mathcal{D}$ that satisfies the co-universal property\nexpressed by the diagram below. I.e., a kernel is the same thing as a\nuniversal morphism from $F$ to $f$. $$\\xymatrix{\n  K'\\ar@{-->}[dr]_r  & & K'\\ar[dd]_{k'}\\ar@{-->}[dr]^r\\ar[rr]^0 & & K'\\ar[dd]^0 \\ar@{-->}[dr]^0\\\\\n  & K   &    &  K\\ar[ld]_k \\ar[rr]_{0~~~}  & & K\\ar[ld]^0 \\\\\n     & & X\\ar[rr]_f & & Y\n}$$\n\n#### Limits and colimits.\n\nLimits and colimits are important special cases of universal\nconstructions. Let $\\mathcal{J}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ be categories with\n$\\mathcal{J}$ small ($\\mathcal{J}$ is to be thought of as an index\ncategory) and let $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{J}$ be the corresponding functor\ncategory of functors from $\\mathcal{J}$ to $\\mathcal{C}$. The *diagonal\nfunctor* $\\Delta \\colon \\mathcal{C} \\to \n\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{J}$ is the functor that maps each object\n$N\\in\\mathcal{C}$ to the constant functor\n$\\Delta(N) \\colon \\mathcal{J} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ (i.e., $\\Delta(N)(X) = N$\nfor each $X\\in \\mathcal{J}$.) Given a functor\n$F \\colon \\mathcal{J} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ (thought of as an object in\n$\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{J}$), the limit of $F$, if it exists, is nothing\nbut a universal morphism from $\\Delta$ to $F$. Dually, the colimit of\n$F$ is a co-universal morphism from $F$ to $\\Delta$.\n\nMotivational remarks.\n=====================\n\nFor the most part, the objects in a category which are constructed in\nterms of universal mapping properties are not new to the theorist of\nthese categories. For example, topologist long knew that a new topology\nresults from a Cartesian product of topologies. However the general\nvocabulary allows for easier detection and understanding of functors\nbetween different categories. For example, the homology functors take\nthe coproducts \u2013 in topology \u2013 to coproducts of modules \u2013 direct sums in\nmodule categories. Proofs of these facts are in no way facilitated by\ncategory theory but the terminology is at least uniform and thus easier\nto conceptualize and express.\n\nOnce one recognizes a certain construction as given by a universal\nmapping property, one gains several benefits.\n\n-   Universal mapping properties define objects up to a unique\n    isomorphism. One strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic\n    is therefore to show that they satisfy the same universal mapping\n    property.\n\n-   The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if\n    the construction satisfies a universal mapping property, one can\n    forget all those details; all there is to know about the construct\n    is already contained in the universal mapping property. Proofs often\n    become short and elegant if the universal mapping property is used\n    rather than the concrete details.\n\n-   If the universal construction can be carried out for every $X$ in\n    $\\mathcal{C}$, then we know that we obtain a functor from\n    $\\mathcal{C}$ to $D$. For example, forming kernels is functorial;\n    every commutative square $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ from the morphism $f$ to\n    the morphism $g$ induces a morphism from the kernel of $f$ to the\n    kernel of $g$.\n\n-   Furthermore, if such a functor can be formed, it is a right or left\n    adjoint to $U$. But right adjoints commute with limits, and left\n    adjoints commute with colimits! So, looking back at the previous\n    example, we can immediately conclude that the kernel of a product is\n    equal to the product of the kernels.\n\nUniversal mapping properties of various topological constructions were\npresented by Pierre Samuel in 1948. They were later used extensively by\nBourbaki. The closely related concept of adjoint functors was introduced\nindependently by Daniel Kan in 1958.\n\n[10]{} Thomas W.
