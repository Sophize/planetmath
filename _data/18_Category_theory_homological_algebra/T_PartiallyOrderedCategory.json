  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category in which for every pair of objects\n$A,B$, the collection $\\hom(A,B)$ is a set. $\\mathcal{C}$ is called a\n*partially ordered category* if $\\hom(A,B)\\cup \\hom(B,A)$ has at most\none element. The reason why it is called *partially ordered* is because\nwe can put a partial order on the objects of $\\mathcal{C}$, as follows:\n$$A\\le B \\qquad \\mbox{iff} \\qquad \\hom(A,B)\\ne \\varnothing.$$ It is\neasily verified that $\\le$ is a partial order on\n$\\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$: clearly, $\\hom(A,A)$ is a singleton as\nit contains the identity morphism, so that $\\le$ is reflexive; if\n$\\hom(A,B)\\ne \\varnothing$ and $A\\ne B$, then $\\hom(B,A)=\\varnothing$ by\ndefinition, and so $\\le$ is antisymmetric; finally, if neither\n$\\hom(A,B)$ nor $\\hom(B,C)$ are empty, then $\\hom(A,C)$ can not be\nempty, as it contains the composition of the elements in $\\hom(A,B)$ and\n$\\hom(B,C)$, and thus $\\le$ is transitive.\n\nIt is easy to see that any poset can be realized as categroy, and in\nfact, a partially ordered category.\n\nGiven a partially ordered category $\\mathcal{C}$, the partial order\ndefined on the objects of $\\mathcal{C}$ may be extended to a partial\norder on the morphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$. Formally, let $f,g$ be\nmorphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$. Define $f\\le g$ iff\n$\\operatorname{dom}(f)\\le \\operatorname{dom}(g)$ and\n$\\operatorname{codom}(f)\\le \\operatorname{codom}(g)$. This binary\nrelation can be immediately verified as a partial order (on the *class*\nof all morphisms), and an extension of the partial order on objects of\n$\\mathcal{C}$, since every object is identified the corresponding\nidentity morphism. Furthermore, the partial order respects composition,\nif $f\\le g$, then\n\n-   $f\\circ h \\le g\\circ h$, provided that\n    $\\operatorname{dom}(f)=\\operatorname{dom}(g)=\\operatorname{codom}(h)$,\n\n-   $h\\circ f \\le h\\circ g$, provided that\n    $\\operatorname{codom}(f)=\\operatorname{codom}(g)=\\operatorname{dom}(h)$.\n\nCombining the two above, we see that $f_1\\le g_1$ and $f_2\\le g_2$ imply\n$f_1\\circ f_2 \\le g_1\\le g_2$, provided that $f_1\\circ f_2$ and\n$g_1\\circ g_2$ are both defined.\n\n**Remarks**. From a partially ordered category, one may also define\n\n-   a *linearly ordered category*, which is partially category in which\n    $\\hom(A,B)\\cup \\hom(B,A)$ has at least one element for every pair\n    $A,B$ of objects\n\n-   a *directed category*, which is a partially ordered category in\n    which for every pair $A,B$ of objects, there is an object $C$ such\n    that $\\hom(A,C)$ and $\\hom(B,C)$ are both non-empty.\n\n-   The definition given above of a partially ordered category can be\n    generalized. Instead of having a partial order on the objects of the\n    category, the partial order is now on the morphisms. Let\n    $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category such that a partial order $\\le$ is given\n    on the class of morphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$. This partial order\n    induces a partial order on the objects: $A\\le B$ iff $1_A\\le 1_B$.\n    Call $\\mathcal{C}$ a *partially ordered category* if\n\n    1.  if $f\\le g$, then\n        $\\operatorname{dom}(f)\\le \\operatorname{dom}(g)$ and\n        $\\operatorname{codom}(f)\\le \\operatorname{codom}(g)$,\n\n    2.  if $f_1\\le g_1$ and $f_2\\le g_2$ such that $f_1\\circ f_2$ and\n        $g_1\\circ g_2$ are defined, then\n        $f_1\\circ f_2 \\le g_1\\circ g_2$,\n\n    3.  for any $A$ and $f$ such that $A\\le \\operatorname{dom}(f)$,\n        there exists a unique $g$ such that $g\\le f$ with\n        $\\operatorname{dom}(g)=A$,\n\n    4.  for any $A$ and $f$ such that $A\\le \\operatorname{codom}(f)$,\n        there exists a unique $g$ such that $g\\le f$ with\n        $\\operatorname{codom}(g)=A$.\n\n    It\u2019s not hard to see that the above definition does generalize the\n    one given at the beginning of the entry. For example, to see 3., let\n    $f:B\\to C$. So $A\\le B$, which means there is a unique $h:A\\to B$.\n    Then $g= f\\circ h:A\\to C$ is the desired morphism: $g$ is unique,\n    $\\operatorname{dom}(g)=A$, and $g\\le f$.\n\n[9]{} A. J.
