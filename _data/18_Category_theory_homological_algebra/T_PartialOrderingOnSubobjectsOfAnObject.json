  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $A$ an object $\\mathcal{C}$. Recall\nthat a subobject of $A$ is just an equivalent class of equivalent\nmonomorphisms into $A$. A subobject is denoted by $[f:B\\to A]$, where\n$f$ is monomorphic, or simply $[B]$, whenever there is no confusion.\nFurthermore, we write $B\\subseteq A$ to mean that $B$ is a subobject of\n$A$, and write $B\\cong C$ whenever $[B]=[C]$. The class of all\nsubobjects of $A$ is denoted by ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$. We wish to put a\npartial order on ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$.\n\nGiven any two monomorphisms $f:B \\to A$ and $g:C\\to A$, define $g\\le f$\niff there is a morphism $h:C\\to B$ such that $$\\xymatrix{\nC\\ar[dr]^g\\ar[dd]_h\\\\\n&A\\\\\nB\\ar[ur]_f\n}$$ Now, if $f':B'\\to A$ is equivalent to $f$ and $g':C\\to A$ is\nequivalent to $g$, then we have morphisms $x:C\\to C'$ and $x':C'\\to C$\nand $y:B\\to B'$ and $y':B'\\to B$ such that the diagram below consisting\nof only the solid lines is commutative: $$\\xymatrix{\nC\\ar[dr]_g\\ar[dd]_h\\ar[rr]_x & & C'\\ar[dl]^{g'}\\ar[ll]_{x'} \\ar@{.>}[dd]^{h'} \\\\\n&A &\\\\\nB\\ar[ur]^f\\ar[rr]_y & & B'\\ar[ul]_{f'}\\ar[ll]_{y'}\n}$$ We define $h'=y\\circ h\\circ x'$ (the dotted line above). Then the\ndiagram above including the dotted line is commutative: as\n$f'\\circ h'=f'\\circ (y\\circ h\\circ x')= f\\circ (h\\circ x')=g \\circ x' = g'$.\nHence $g'\\le f'$. As a result, $\\le$ induces a binary relation on\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$: $$C\\le B$$ iff there are representing\nmonomorphisms $f:B\\to A$ and $g:C\\to A$ such that $g\\le f$. Let us use\nthe same notation $\\le$ for the induced relation. Then $\\le$ on\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$ is a partial ordering on ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$:\n\nreflexivity:\n\n:   $B\\le B$, because the composition of the identity morphism $1_B$\n    with any representing monomorphism $f:B\\to A$ is $f$ itself.\n\nanti-symmetry:\n\n:   if $B\\le C$ and $C\\le B$, then there are representing monomorphisms\n    $f:B\\to A$ and $g:C\\to A$ such that $f\\le g$ and $g\\le f$. So there\n    are morphisms $h:B\\to C$ and $h':C\\to B$ such that $$\\xymatrix{\n    C\\ar@<0.5ex>[dr]^g \\ar@<0.5ex>[dd]^{h'}\\\\\n    &A\\\\\n    B\\ar@<-0.5ex>[ur]_f \\ar@<0.5ex>[uu]^h\n    }$$ is commutative. But this just means that $h$ and $h'$ are\n    inverses of one other, or $B\\cong C$, so that they are the same\n    subobject of $A$.\n\ntransitivity:\n\n:   if $D\\le C$ and $C\\le B$, then there are representing monomorphisms\n    $f:B\\to A$, $g:C\\to A$ and $h:D\\to A$ such that $h\\le g$ and\n    $g\\le f$. This means there are morphisms $r:D\\to C$ and $s:C\\to B$\n    such that $g\\circ r = h$ and $f\\circ s=g$. Since\n    $f\\circ (s\\circ r)=g\\circ r=h$, $h\\le f$, and as a result, $D\\le B$.\n\nThus, $\\le$ turns ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$ into a partially ordered class,\nwith top element $A$. With this, we may form the notions of unions and\nintersections of subobjects. Formally, let\n$\\lbrace B_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a collection of subobjects of $A$,\nindexed by a set $I$.\n\n-   The *union* $C$ of $B_i$ is the supremum of the $B_i$\u2019s with respect\n    to $\\le$, provided that it exists. In notation, we write\n    $$C=\\bigvee_{i\\in I} B_i.$$\n\n-   The *intersection* $D$ of $B_i$ is the infimum of the $B_i$\u2019s with\n    respect to $\\le$, provided that it exists. In notation, we write\n    $$D=\\bigwedge_{i\\in I} B_i.$$\n\nFor example, let $f:B \\to A$ and $g:C\\to A$ be subobjects of $A$. Then\nthe pullback of $f$ and $g$, if it exists, is the intersection of $B$\nand $C$.\n\n**Remark**. It can be shown that in any Abelian category,\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(A)$ under $\\le$ is a lattice for any object $A$.",
