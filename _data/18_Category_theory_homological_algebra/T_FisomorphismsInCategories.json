  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ be categories,\n$F:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}$ be a (covariant or contravariant) functor\nand let $\\alpha\\in\\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)$ be a morphism, where\n$A,B\\in\\mathrm{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$.\\\n**Definition**. A morphism $\\alpha:A\\to B$ is an $F$*-isomorphism* if\n$F(\\alpha)$ is an isomorphism in $\\mathcal{D}$.\\\nNote that each isomorphism in $\\mathcal{C}$ is an $F$-isomorphism for\neach functor $F$. The converse is true in the following sense: if\n$\\alpha$ is an $F$-isomorphism for each functor $F$ then $\\alpha$ is an\nisomorphism. On the other hand there are $F$-isomorphisms which are not\nisomorphisms.\n\nAlso note, that if $\\alpha:X\\to Y$ is an $F$-isomorphism, then there\ndoes not have to exist morphism $\\beta:Y\\to X$ which is ,,$F$-inverse\u201d\nto $\\alpha$. Indeed, there may be no $F$-isomorphism from $Y$ to $X$,\nsee examples:\\\n**Example**. $1)$ Let $X$ be an object in $\\mathcal{D}$ and define\n$F_{X}:\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{D}$ as follows: for\n$A\\in\\mathrm{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$ put $F_{X}(A)=X$ and for\n$\\alpha\\in\\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)$ put $F_{X}(\\alpha)=\\mathrm{id}_{X}$. This\nis the constant functor and every morphism in $\\mathcal{C}$ is an\n$F_{X}$-isomorphism (although it does not have to be an isomorphism). In\nparticular, it may happen that for some objects $X$ and $Y$ in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ there is a morphism from $X$ to $Y$ but no morphism from\n$Y$ to $X$. In this case there is an $F_X$-isomorphism from $X$ to $Y$\nbut not vice versa.\\\n\\\n$2)$ Let $\\mathcal{T}\\mathrm{op}^{*}$ be the category of pointed\ntopological spaces and continous maps preserving based point,\n$\\mathcal{S}\\mathrm{et}$ be the category of sets and functions,\n$\\mathcal{G}\\mathrm{r}$ be the category of groups and homomorphisms.\nConsider the functor\n$\\pi:\\mathcal{T}\\mathrm{op}^{*}\\to\\mathcal{S}\\mathrm{et}\\times\\mathcal{G}\\mathrm{r}\\times\\mathcal{G}\\mathrm{r}\\times\\cdots$\ndefined by:\n$$\\pi(X,x_{0})=(\\pi_{0}(X,x_{0}),\\pi_{1}(X,x_{0}),\\pi_{2}(X,x_{0}),\\pi_{3}(X,x_{0}),\\ldots);$$\n$$\\pi(f)=(\\pi_{0}(f),\\pi_{1}(f),\\pi_{2}(f),\\pi_{3}(f),\\ldots),$$ where\n$\\pi_{n}$ is the $n$-th homotopy group functor. Then $\\pi$-isomorphism\nis a weak homotopy equivalence and it is known (due to Whitehead) that\neach weak homotopy equivalence between pointed $\\mathrm{CW}$-complexes\nis the homotopy equivalance. On the other hand there are weak homotopy\nequivalences which are not homotopy equivalences.\n\nThe concept of $F$-isomorphism is especially important in representation\ntheory, where $F$ is the homology functor from category of complexes\nover an abelian category $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{C}$.",
