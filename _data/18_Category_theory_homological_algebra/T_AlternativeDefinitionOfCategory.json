  "definition": "When compared with set theory, category theory may seem ontologically\nextravagant; after all, set theory postulates the existence of only one\ntype of entity, the class, while category theory postulates the\nexistence of at least two types, objects and morphisms. However, it is\npossible to dispense with objects and deal only with morphisms. The\nbasic idea behind this reduction is the observation that objects appear\nin a one-to-one correspondence with their identity morphisms. Thus to\nsay what a category is, we need only specify the axioms the morphisms\nmust obey; ultimately this will allow us to present a category as a sort\nof partial algebraic system, with a partial binary operation\nrepresenting composition of morphisms and two unary operations\nrepresenting the domain and codomain of a morphism.\n\nLet $M$ be a class. Its members will be called *morphisms*. Then a\n*category* on $M$ consists of the following ingredients:\n\n-   a partial binary operation ${\\circ}\\colon M\\times M\\to M$, called\n    *composition*;\n\n-   a unary operation ${S}\\colon M\\to M$, called *source* or *domain*;\n    and\n\n-   a unary operation ${T}\\colon M\\to M$, called *target* or *codomain*.\n\nThe above operations are required to satisfy the following axioms.\n\n1.  [**(Right absorption.)**]{} For any morphism $f$,\n    $${S}{S}f = {T}{S}f = {S}f \\text{\\quad and\\quad}\n    {T}{S}f = {T}{T}f = {T}f.$$\n\n2.  [**(Existence of composite morphisms.)**]{} The composite morphism\n    $g{\\circ}f$ is defined if and only if ${T}g =\n    {S}f$; the morphism $g{\\circ}f$ has source ${S}(g{\\circ}f) = {S}f$\n    and target ${T}(g{\\circ}f) = {T}f$. $$\\xymatrix{\n    \\bullet\\ar@(ul,dl)[]_{{S}(g{\\circ}f) = {S}f}\\ar[r]^f\\ar@{.>}[rd]_{\\exists !\\, g{\\circ}f} & \\bullet\\ar[d]^g \\\\\n                                                     & \\bullet\\ar@(dr,ur)_{{T}(g{\\circ}f) = {T}g}\n    }$$\n\n3.  [**(Existence of identity morphisms.)**]{} For any morphism $f$,\n    ${T}f{\\circ}f = f{\\circ}{S}f = f$. $$\\xymatrix{\n      \\bullet\\ar[r]^f\\ar[d]_{{S}f}\\ar[rd]^f \n    & \\bullet\\ar[d]^{{T}f} \\\\\n      \\bullet\\ar[r]_f \n    & \\bullet\n    }$$\n\n4.  [**(Associativity of composition.)**]{} Whenever $h{\\circ}g$ and\n    $g{\\circ}f$ are both defined, then\n    $h{\\circ}(g{\\circ}f) = (h{\\circ}g){\\circ}f$. $$\\xymatrix{\n      \\bullet\\ar[r]^f\\ar[rd]_{g{\\circ}f} \n    & \\bullet\\ar[d]^g\\ar[rd]^{h{\\circ}g}\n    & \\\\\n    & \\bullet\\ar[r]_h \n    & \\bullet\n    }$$\n\nUsing this definition, we can define an *object* to be a morphism in the\nimage of ${S}$; by the right absorption law, this is equivalent to being\nin the image of ${T}$. If we also define ${\\mathrm{Hom}}(A,B)$ to be the\ncollection of morphisms $f$ such that ${S}f =\nA$ and ${T}f = B$, then we recover the rest of the ordinary definition\nof category.\n\n[8]{} P.
