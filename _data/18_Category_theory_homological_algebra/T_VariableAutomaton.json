  "definition": "Introduction\n============\n\nThe question of a variable \u2018automaton\u2019, or an automaton with\n[*varying*]{} internal structure goes back to Norbert Wiener\u2019s\nsuggestion in his book on .\n\nA , [*s-automaton*]{} ${\\mathcal A}$, or \u2018sequential machine\u2019, is\ndefined as a quintuple of three sets: $I$,$O$ and $S$, and two\nset-theoretical mappings:\n\n$$(I, O, S, \\delta: I \\times S \\rightarrow S; \\lambda: S \\times S \\rightarrow O),$$,\n\nwhere $I$ is the set of s-automaton inputs, $S$ is the set of states (or\nthe state space of the s-automaton), $O$ is the set of s-automaton\noutputs, $\\delta$ is the [*transition function*]{} that maps a\ns-automaton state $s_j$ onto its next state $s_{j+1}$ in response to a\nspecific s-automaton input $j \\in I$, and $\\lambda$ is the [*output\nfunction*]{} that maps couples of consecutive (or sequential)\ns-automaton states $(s_i, s_{i+1})$ onto s-automaton outputs $o_{i+1}$\n($(s_i, s_{i+1}) \\mapsto o_{i+1}$, hence the older name of \u2018sequential\nmachine\u2019 for the s-automaton).\n\n[*An alternative definition*]{} of an automaton is also in use: as a\nfive-tuple $(S, \\Sigma, \\delta, I, F)$, where $\\Sigma$ is a non-empty\nset of symbols $\\alpha$ such that one can define a [*configuration*]{}\nof the automaton as a couple $(s,\\alpha)$ of a state $s \\in S $ and a\nsymbol $\\alpha \\in \\Sigma $. Then $\\delta$ defines a \u201cnext-state\nrelation, or a transition relation\u201d which associates to each\nconfiguration $(s, \\alpha)$ a subset $\\delta (s,\\alpha)$ of S- the state\nspace of the automaton.\n\nWith this formal automaton definition, the *category of abstract\nautomata* can be defined by specifying automata homomorphisms in terms\nof the morphisms between five-tuples representing such abstract\nautomata.\n\nA special case of automaton is that of a [*stable automaton*]{} when all\nits state transitions are [*reversible*]{}; then its state space can be\nseen to possess a groupoid (algebraic) structure. The [*category of\nreversible automata*]{} is then a 2-category, and also a subcategory of\nthe 2-category of groupoids, or the groupoid category.\n\n[*A categorical automaton*]{} can also be defined by a commutative\nsquare diagram containing all of the above components.\n\nWith the above automaton definition(s) one can now also define morphisms\nbetween automata and their composition.\n\nA *homomorphism of automata* or [*automaton homomorphism*]{} is a\nmorphism of automata quintuples that preserves commutativity of the\nset-theoretical mapping compositions of both the transition function\n$\\delta$ and the output function $\\lambda$.\n\nWith the previous two definitions one has now sufficient data to be able\nto define the category of automata and automata homomorphisms, $C_A$.\n\nCategories of Automata and Variable Automata Definitions\n========================================================\n\nA [*category of automata*]{} [**$C_A$**]{} is defined as a category of\nquintuples\n$(I, O, X, \\delta: I \\times X \\rightarrow X; \\lambda: X \\times S \\rightarrow O)$\nand automata homomorphisms\n$h:{{\\mathcal A}}_i \\rightarrow {{\\mathcal A}}_j$, such that these\nhomomorphisms commute with both the transition and the output functions\nof any automata ${{\\mathcal A}}_i$ and ${{\\mathcal A}}_j$.\n\nA formal definition of an [**\u2018automaton with a [*varying*]{} internal\nstructure\u2019**]{} is here proposed, and then extended by means of\ncategorical concepts in the context of $\\mathbb{S}_2$ of automata state\nspaces $S_X$ and automata state space homomorphisms\n$h_{XY}: S_X \\to S_Y$.\n\nAs a relatively simple example consider the case of the category of\nsequential, or Turing machines, [**$T_a$**]{}, which is a subcategory of\nthe category of automata [**$C_A$**]{}.\n\nA \u2018variable Turing machine\u2019 is a supercategory $\\mathbb{S}^T$ of Turing\nmachine topological semigroup (or monoid) categories [**$S_{TX}$**]{}\nand topological semigroup (monoid) functors\n$F_{T_{XY}}: S_{TX} \\to S_{TY}$ between pairs of such semigroup (or\nmonoid) categories.\n\nIn the general case of [*universal Turing machines*]{} ($UTS$) one\nsimply replaces \u2018Turing machine\u2019 with $UTS$ in the previous definition\nto obtain a formal representation of [*[**variable**]{} universal Turing\nmachines*]{}, $V_{UTS}$.\n\nRemarks:\n--------\n\n1.  [*Automaton homomorphisms*]{} can be considered also as\n    transformations of automata, or as semigroup homomorphisms, when the\n    state space, $X$, of the automaton is defined as a [*semigroup*]{}\n    $S_X$.\n\n2.  Abstract automata have numerous realizations in the real world as :\n    machines, robots, devices, computers, supercomputers, always\n    considered as *discrete* state space sequential machines.\n\n3.  Fuzzy or analog devices are not included as standard automata.\n\n4.  Similarly, *variable (transition function)* automata, and especially\n    $V_{UTM}$s, are not included, but rigid Universal Turing machines\n    are included.\n\n5.  Such variable automata as $V_{UTM}$s may be practically constructed\n    for both industrial, agricultural and Biotechnology/medical\n    applications, and perhaps also as [*\u2018nanobots\u2019*]{}, by employing as\n    part of their logical operation design MV-logics, such as the\n    [*$LM_N$-algebraic logic*]{}, with $N$ being finite.\n\n6.  Other definitions of automata, sequential machines, semigroup\n    automata or cellular automata lead to subcategories of the category\n    of automata defined above.\n\n7.  On the other hand, the category of is not a subcategory of the\n    automata category defined here.\n\n.\n\n[**More to come...**]{}\n\nReferences Cited\n================\n\nWiener, Norbert. 1988. \u201c[*The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and\nSociety*]{}\".
