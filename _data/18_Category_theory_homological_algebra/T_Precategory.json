  "definition": "A *precategory* $\\mathcal{B}$ consists of the following\n\n1.  a class of objects, called objects of $\\mathcal{B}$, written\n    $Ob(\\mathcal{B})$\n\n2.  a set of elements, called arrows or morphisms, for *each* ordered\n    pair $(A,B)$ of objects in $\\mathcal{B}$, usually written\n    $\\hom(A,B)$. For any arrow $f\\in\\hom(A,B)$, $A$ is called the\n    *domain* of $f$ and $B$ is the *codomain* of $f$. It is required\n    that $\\hom(A,B)\\cap\\hom(C,D)=\\varnothing$ if $(A,B)\\neq(C,D)$.\n\nIf $Ob(\\mathcal{B})$ is a set, then we say that $\\mathcal{B}$ is\n*small*. A small precategory is just a directed pseudograph (a digraph\nallowing multiple edges between pairs of vertices), indeed, for the\ncollection of all arrows in $\\mathcal{B}$ is a set, written\n$Mor(\\mathcal{B})$. In addition, there are two functions\n$$\\operatorname{dom},\\operatorname{codom}:Mor(\\mathcal{B})\\to Obj(\\mathcal{B})$$\nsuch that $\\operatorname{dom}(f)$ is the domain of $f$ and\n$\\operatorname{codom}(f)$ is the codomain of $f$. Note that both\n$\\operatorname{dom}$ and $\\operatorname{codom}$ are well-defined\nfunctions because if $f\\in \\hom(A,B)\\cap \\hom(C,D)$, then $A=B$ and\n$C=D$, so that both $\\operatorname{dom}$ and $\\operatorname{codom}$ map\n$f$ to unique objects $A$ and $B$ respectively.\n\nWith the realization that a precategory is essentially a directed graph,\nwe may use the language of graph theory to define concepts such as paths\nand loops in a precategory. This will allow us to enlarge any\nprecategory to a category. We will carry out the construction below.\n\n### Paths Defined {#paths-defined .unnumbered}\n\nLet $\\mathcal{B}$ be a precategory. A *path* $p$ (in $\\mathcal{B}$) is a\nfinite sequence of arrows $f_1,\\ldots,f_n$ such that the codomain of\n$f_i$ is the domain of $f_{i+1}$. Note that the definition here does not\nparallel the one given for a graph (as in graph theory), since we allow\nvertices (domains and codomains), as well as edges (arrows or morphisms)\nto coincide. The *length* of a path $p=(p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$ is defined to\nbe the non-negative integer $n$.\n\nGiven a path $p = (f_1,\\ldots, f_n)$, we may set the domain of $p$,\nwritten $\\operatorname{dom}(p)$, to be $\\operatorname{dom}(f_1)$, and\ncodomain of $p$, written $\\operatorname{codom}(p)$, to be\n$\\operatorname{codom}(f_n)$. A *loop* is a path $p$ where\n$\\operatorname{dom}(p)=\\operatorname{codom}(p)$.\n\nNext, for each ordered pair of objects $(A,B)$ in a precategory\n$\\mathcal{B}$, the collection of paths with with domain $A$ and codomain\n$B$ is a set, and we denote it by $\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$.\n\n### Composition of Paths Defined {#composition-of-paths-defined .unnumbered}\n\nNow, let $f\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$ and\n$g\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(B,C)$. So $f=(f_1,\\ldots,f_n)$ and\n$g=(g_1,\\ldots,g_m)$. Since\n$\\operatorname{codom}(f_n)=B=\\operatorname{dom}(g_1)$, we can\n\u201cconcatenate\u201d the two paths and form a new path\n$$(f_1,\\ldots,f_n,g_1,\\ldots,g_m),$$ and we write $g\\circ f$ for this\nnew path. It is clear that $g\\circ f\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(A,C)$. It is\nalso easy to see that $\\circ$ is a function from\n$\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)\\times \\operatorname{Hom}(B,C)$ to\n$\\operatorname{Hom}(A,C)$, if we set $\\circ(f,g):= g\\circ f$. As the\n\u201cconcatenation\u201d operation is evidently associative,\n$(h\\circ g)\\circ f=h\\circ (g\\circ f)$.\n\n### Empty Paths Defined {#empty-paths-defined .unnumbered}\n\nFinally, for each object $A$ in $Ob(\\mathcal{B})$, we can artificially\nassociate an *empty path* $1_A$ with $A$, with the following properties\n\n-   $1_A$ is a path with length $0$\n\n-   $\\operatorname{dom}(1_A)=\\operatorname{codom}(1_A):=A$; in other\n    words, $1_A\\in \\operatorname{Hom}(A,A)$\n\n-   for any $f\\in\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$ and\n    $g\\in\\operatorname{Hom}(C,A)$, $f\\circ 1_A:=f$ and $1_A\\circ g:=g$.\n\nThe class of all paths, including every empty path for each object, in\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is written $Path(\\mathcal{B})$.\n\n### Precategory Enlarged to a Category {#precategory-enlarged-to-a-category .unnumbered}\n\nSo if we start out with a precategory $\\mathcal{B}$, we end up with a\ncategory $\\mathcal{\\overline{B}}$ such that\n\n1.  $Ob(\\mathcal{\\overline{B}})=Ob(\\mathcal{B})$\n\n2.  $Mor(\\mathcal{\\overline{B}})=Path(\\mathcal{B})$, such that\n\n    -   domain and codomain of each morphism are defined to be the\n        domain and codomain of the underlying path\n\n    -   for each ordered pair $(A,B)$ of objects in\n        $\\mathcal{\\overline{B}}$, the collection of morphisms with\n        domain $A$ and codomain $B$ is a set, and is denoted by\n        $\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$\n\n    -   for every triple of objects $A,B,C$, a function $\\circ$ is\n        defined to be the \u201cconcatenation\u201d of a path from $A$ to $B$ and\n        a path from $B$ to $C$\n\n    -   the identity morphism $1_A$ each object $A$ is just the empty\n        path associated with $A$.\n\nWe may embed $\\mathcal{B}$ in $\\mathcal{\\overline{B}}$ so that\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is just a diagram of $\\mathcal{\\overline{B}}$. Because of\nthis, $\\mathcal{B}$ is also known as a *diagram scheme*.\n$\\mathcal{\\overline{B}}$, also written $F(\\mathcal{B})$, is known as the\n*free category* freely generated by $\\mathcal{B}$.",
