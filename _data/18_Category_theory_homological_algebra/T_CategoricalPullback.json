  "definition": "Pullbacks {#pullbacks .unnumbered}\n---------\n\nLet $f:X\\to B$ and $g:Y\\to B$ be morphisms in a category $\\mathcal{C}$.\nThen a *pullback diagram*, or *pullback square* of $f$ and $g$ is a\ncommutative diagram $$\\xymatrix{\nA\\ar[d]_p \\ar[r]^q & Y\\ar[d]^g \\\\\nX\\ar[r]_f       & B.\n}$$ such that if we have another commutative diagram $$\\xymatrix{\nZ\\ar[d]_r\\ar[r]^s & Y\\ar[d]^g \\\\\nX\\ar[r]_f       & B.\n}$$ then there is a unique morphism $h:Z\\to A$ with the commutative\ndiagram $$\\xymatrix{\nZ\\ar@/^1ex/[rrd]^s \\ar@/_1ex/[rdd]_r \\ar@{.>}[rd]|h & & \\\\\n  & A\\ar[d]_p\\ar[r]^q & Y\\ar[d]^g \\\\\n  & X\\ar[r]_f                 & B.\n}$$\n\nA *pullback* of $(f,g)$ is the ordered triple $(A,q,p)$. We also say\nthat $p$ is a *pullback of $g$ along $f$*, and $q$ a *pullback of $f$\nalong $g$*. When a pullback of $(f,g)$ exists, it is unique up to\nisomorphism. The object $A$, and the morphisms $p$ and $q$ in the\ndiagram above are often denoted by\n$$X\\times_B Y,\\qquad 1_X \\times_B g\\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad f\\times_B 1_Y$$\nrespectively, and the uniquely determined morphism $h$ by\n$$\\displaystyle{r \\choose s}.$$ It is easy to see that\n$$X\\times_B Y\\cong Y\\times_B X,$$ whenever one (and hence the other)\nexists.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The pullback of $f$ and $g$ can be equivalently defined as a\n    limiting cone over the diagram $X\\to B{\\leftarrow}Y$. In other\n    words, a pullback diagram is a terminal object in the category of\n    commutative squares of the form $$\\xymatrix{\n    Z\\ar[d] \\ar[r] & Y\\ar[d]^g \\\\\n    X\\ar[r]_f       & B.\n    }$$\n\n-   A category $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to *have pullbacks* if every\n    diagram $X \\to B {\\leftarrow}Y$ can be completed into a pullback\n    diagram.\n\n-   The notion of pullbacks can be generalized: let\n    $\\lbrace x_i: C_i \\to C \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a collection of\n    morphisms indexed by set $I$, considered as a small diagram. The\n    *generalized pullback* of the $x_i$\u2019s is just the limiting cone of\n    the diagram. Using this definition, the generalized pullback of one\n    morphism $f$ is the identity morphism of $\\operatorname{dom}(f)$,\n    the domain of $f$, and the generalized pullback of the empty set is\n    a terminal object.\n\n-   A pullback is sometimes known as an *amalgamated sum*.\n\nPushouts {#pushouts .unnumbered}\n--------\n\nDually, given morphisms $f:B\\to X$ and $g:B\\to Y$, a *pushout square* of\n$f$ and $g$ is a commutative diagram $$\\xymatrix{\nB\\ar[d]_f \\ar[r]^g & Y\\ar[d]^s \\\\\nX\\ar[r]_t       & A\n}$$ such that if we have another commutative diagram $$\\xymatrix{\nB\\ar[d]_f \\ar[r]^g & Y\\ar[d]^u \\\\\nX\\ar[r]_v       & Z\n}$$ Then there is a unique morphism $h:A\\to Z$ with the following\ncommutative diagram: $$\\xymatrix{\nB\\ar[d]_f \\ar[r]^g & Y\\ar[d]^s \\ar@/^1ex/[ddr]^u & \\\\\nX\\ar[r]_t \\ar@/_1ex/[drr]_v & A \\ar@{.>}[dr]|-h & \\\\\n& & Z.\n}$$\n\nThe pair $(s,t)$ of morphisms is a *pushout* of $(f,g)$. $s$ is the the\n*pushout of $f$ along $g$*, and $t$ the *pushout of $g$ along $f$*. Like\npullbacks, pushouts are unique up to unique isomorphism when they exist.\nThe object $A$ and the morphisms $s$ and $t$ are typically written\n$$X\\amalg_B Y,\\qquad f\\amalg_B 1_Y \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad 1_X \\amalg_B g,$$\nand the unique morphism $h$ is denoted by $$(f \\enspace g).$$\n\n**Remark**. The pushout of $f$ and $g$ can be thought of as the limiting\ncocone under the diagram $X {\\leftarrow}B \\to Y$. Equivalently, they are\ninitial objects in the category of commutative squares whose top edge is\n$B\\to Y$ and left edge is $B\\to X$. A category is said to *have\npushouts* if every diagram $X {\\leftarrow}B \\to Y$ can be completed to a\npushout diagram. The *generalized pushout* is defined as the limiting\ncocone under the diagram consisting of morphisms $y_i: B\\to B_i$, where\n$i$ belongs to some set $I$.",
