  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. A sequence of and homomorphisms $$\\cdots \\rightarrow\n  A_{n+1} \\buildrel {d_{n+1}} \\over \\longrightarrow\n  A_n \\buildrel {d_n} \\over \\longrightarrow\n  A_{n-1} \\rightarrow\n  \\cdots$$ is said to be a *chain complex* (or *$R$-complex*, or just\n*complex*) if each pair of adjacent homomorphisms $(d_{n+1}, d_n)$\nsatisfies the relation $d_n\\circ d_{n+1} = 0$. This is equivalent to\nsaying that $\\im d_{n+1} \\subseteq \\ker d_n$. We often denote such a\ncomplex by $({\\bold A}, d)$, or simply ${\\bold A}$.\n\nCompare this to the notion of an exact sequence, which requires\n$\\im d_{n+1} = \\ker d_n$.\n\nThe homomorphisms $d_n$ in the chain complex are called *boundary\noperators*, or *boundary maps*.",
