  "definition": "There are occasions when we need to consider objects from different\ncategories being paired up. For example, if $\\mathcal{C}$ is a category,\nthen $\\hom(A,B)$ where $A,B$ are objects of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a set, and\nwe can think of $\\hom$ as a functor from\n$\\mathcal{C}^{\\operatorname{op}}\\times \\mathcal{C}$ to the category of\nsets. But what is $\\mathcal{C}^{\\operatorname{op}}\\times \\mathcal{C}$\nexactly? We will give this a formal definition presently.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ be categories. Define the *Cartesian\nproduct* $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ and\n$\\mathcal{D}$ as the following pair $(O,M)$, where\n\n-   $O$ is the class consisting of ordered pairs $(X,Y)$, where $X$ is\n    an object in $\\mathcal{C}$ and $Y$ is an object in $\\mathcal{D}$\n\n-   $M$ is the class consisting of ordered pairs $(f,g)$, where $f$ is a\n    morphism in $\\mathcal{C}$ and $g$ is a morphism in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nThere is a category structure on $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$. But\nseveral things need to be defined first.\n\n1.  Elements of $O$ are called the *objects* of\n    $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$ and elements of $M$ are called the\n    *morphisms* of $\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{D}$. For each morphism\n    $(f,g)\\in M$, we define the domain and codomain operations\n    $$\\operatorname{dom}(f,g):=(\\operatorname{dom}(f), \\operatorname{dom}(g))\\quad\\mbox{ and }\\quad \\operatorname{cod}(f,g):=(\\operatorname{cod}(f), \\operatorname{cod}(g)).$$\n    Note that for simplicity, we have used the same symbol\n    $\\operatorname{dom}$ and $\\operatorname{cod}$ for\n    $\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D}$, and $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$.\n\n2.  Next, for each pair of objects\n    $A,B\\in \\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{D}$, we have a set $\\hom(A,B)$\n    consisting of all morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$ whose\n    domain is $A$ and codomain is $B$. Note that $\\hom(A,B)$ is a set\n    because it is $\\hom(X,Z)\\times \\hom(Y,T)$, where $A=(X,Y)$ and\n    $B=(Z,T)$ and each component in the product is assumed to be a set.\n\n3.  Finally, for objects $A,B,C$ in $\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{D}$, we\n    have a function $\\circ$ called composition:\n    $$\\circ:\\hom(A,B)\\times \\hom(B,C)\\to \\hom(A,C).$$ To define $\\circ$,\n    write each object $A,B,C$ as ordered pairs: $A=(X,Y)$, $B=(Z,T)$,\n    $C=(U,V)$. In addition, let $\\alpha=(f,g)\\in \\hom(A,B)$ and\n    $\\beta=(p,q)\\in \\hom(B,C)$. Then\n    $$\\circ(\\alpha,\\beta):=(\\circ_1(f,p),\\circ_2(g,q)),$$ where\n    $\\circ_1$ and $\\circ_2$ are compositions defined in $\\mathcal{C}$\n    and $\\mathcal{D}$ respectively, such that\n    $$\\circ_1:\\hom(X,Z)\\times \\hom(Z,U)\\to \\hom(X,U)\\mbox{ and }\\circ_2:\\hom(Y,T)\\times \\hom(T,V)\\to \\hom(Y,V).$$\n    As usual, we write $\\beta\\circ \\alpha$ for $\\circ(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\n\n4.  Now, it is not hard to see that $\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{D}$ with\n    $\\circ$ is a category. For example, let us verify that\n    $(A,B)\\ne (C,D)$ implies $\\hom(A,B)\\cap \\hom(C,D)=\\varnothing$.\n    Write $A=(X,Y)$, $B=(Z,S)$, $C=(T,U)$ and $D=(V,W)$. Suppose\n    $\\alpha=(f,g)\\in \\hom(A,B)\\cap \\hom(C,D)$. Then\n    $f\\in \\hom(X,Z)\\cap \\hom(T,V)$ and $g\\in \\hom(Y,S)\\cap \\hom(U,W)$.\n    But this implies $X=T$, $Z=V$, $Y=U$, and $S=W$. So\n    $A=(X,Y)=(T,U)=C$ and $B=(Z,S)=(V,W)=D$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The above construction can be generalized to $n$-fold Cartesian\n    products. If $\\mathcal{C}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{C}_n$ be categories.\n    Then $\\mathcal{C}:=\\mathcal{C}_1\\times\\cdots \\mathcal{C}_n$ can be\n    defined much the same way as in the case $n=2$. $\\mathcal{C}$ is a\n    category and is sometimes written $\\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathcal{C}_i$.\n\n-   Associated with this product, we can form $n$ (covariant) functors\n    called *projection functors* $\\Pi_i:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C}_i$,\n    given by $\\Pi_i(A)=A_i$ and $\\Pi_i(\\alpha)=\\alpha_i$, where\n    $A=(A_1,\\ldots,A_n)$ and $\\alpha=(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n)$.\n\n-   The product $\\mathcal{C}$ of $\\mathcal{C}_i$ also enjoys the\n    universal property that for every category $\\mathcal{D}$ and\n    functors $F_i: \\mathcal{D}\\to \\mathcal{C}_i$, there is a unique\n    functor $F:\\mathcal{D}\\to \\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\Pi_i\\circ F=F_i$\n    (in other words, $F_i$ factors through $F$).\n\n-   If fact, any category that enjoys the universal property described\n    above is naturally equivalent to the product of $\\mathcal{C}_i$. We\n    may actually define product category this way, and then prove its\n    existence using the construction that is given as the definition at\n    the beginning of this article.\n\n-   More generally, we can define arbitrary (direct) product of\n    categories. The definition is completely similar to the one above.\n    If $\\lbrace \\mathcal{C}_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a family of\n    categories indexed by a set $I$, we often write\n    $\\prod_{i\\in I} \\mathcal{C}_i$ as the product category. Objects and\n    morphisms are written $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$ and $(\\alpha_i)_{i\\in I}$\n    respectively. When all the $\\mathcal{C}_i$ are identical, say, equal\n    to $\\mathcal{C}$, we also write the product as $\\mathcal{C}^I$, and\n    call it the *$I$-fold direct product of* $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n-   The existence of the product of categories indexed by an arbitrary\n    set shows that the category of (small) categories **Cat** has\n    products.\n\n-   Let $\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{D}\\times\\mathcal{E}$. Then we may identify\n    $\\mathcal{D}$ as a subcategory of $\\mathcal{C}$: for each object $E$\n    in $\\mathcal{E}$, define $F_E:\\mathcal{D}\\to\\mathcal{C}$, by\n    $F_E(A):=(A,E)$ and $F(\\alpha)=(\\alpha,1_E)$. Then $F_E$ is a\n    faithful functor. The image $\\mathcal{C}_E$ of $F_E$ (with objects\n    $(A,E)$ and morphisms $(\\alpha,1_E)$) is a subcategory of\n    $\\mathcal{C}$. It is not hard to see that $\\mathcal{D}$ and\n    $\\mathcal{C}_E$ are .\n\n-   The above also shows that for any objects $A,B$ in $\\mathcal{E}$,\n    $\\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\\mathcal{C}_B$ are isomorphic.",
