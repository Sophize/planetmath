  "definition": "2-Category of Double Groupoids\n==============================\n\nThis is an introduction to the subject of 2-category of double\ngroupoids, including the definition of this new concept. It can also be\nfurther generalized to the 2-category of double categories by removing\nthe constrained that all double groupoid homomorphisms be invertible and\nby replacing the double groupoid with a double category; naturally,\ndouble groupoid homomorphisms are then replaced by 2-functors (that need\nnot be invertible) between double categories.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nLet us recall that if $X$ is a topological space, then a *double\ngoupoid* ${\\mathcal D}$ is defined by the following categorical diagram\nof linked groupoids and sets:\n\n$$\\label{squ} {\\mathcal D}:= \\vcenter{\\xymatrix @=3pc {S \\ar @<1ex> [r] ^{s^1} \\ar @<-1ex> [r]\n_{t^1} \\ar @<1ex> [d]^{\\, t_2} \\ar @<-1ex> [d]_{s_2} & H \\ar[l]\n\\ar @<1ex> [d]^{\\,t}\n\\ar @<-1ex> [d]_s \\\\\nV \\ar [u] \\ar @<1ex> [r] ^s \\ar @<-1ex> [r] _t & M \\ar [l] \\ar[u]}},$$\n\nwhere $M$ is a set of points, $H,V$ are two groupoids (called,\nrespectively, \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d groupoids) , and $S$ is a set\nof (as first defined and represented in ref. [@BHKP] by Brown et al.) .\nA simplified notion of a thin square is that of \u201ca continuous map from\nthe unit square of the real plane into $X$ which factors through a tree\u201d\n([@BHKP]).\n\nHomotopy double groupoid and homotopy 2-groupoid\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe algebraic composition laws, $\\bullet$ and $\\circ$, employed above to\ndefine a double groupoid ${\\mathcal D}$ allow one also to define\n${\\mathcal D}$ as a groupoid internal to the . Thus, in the particular\ncase of a Hausdorff space, $X_H$, a double groupoid called the *homotopy\ndouble groupoid of $X_H$* can be denoted as follows\n\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{\\square}_2 (X_H) := {\\mathcal D},$$\n\nwhere $\\square$ is in this case a . Thus, the construction of a homotopy\ndouble groupoid is based upon the geometric notion of thin square that\nextends the notion of thin relative homotopy as discussed in ref.\n[@BHKP]. One notes however a significant distinction between a homotopy\n2-groupoid and homotopy double groupoid construction; thus, the\nconstruction of the $2$-cells of the homotopy double groupoid is based\nupon a suitable cubical approach to the notion of thin $3$-cube, whereas\nthe construction of the 2-cells of the homotopy $2$-groupoid can be\ninterpreted by means of a globular notion of thin $3$-cube. \u201cThe\nhomotopy double groupoid of a space, and the related homotopy\n$2$-groupoid, are constructed directly from the cubical singular complex\nand so (they) remain close to geometric intuition in an almost classical\nway\u201d (viz. [@BHKP]).\n\nDefintion of 2-Category of Double Groupoids\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe , ${\\mathcal G}^2$\u2013 whose objects (or $2$-cells) are the above\ndiagrams ${\\mathcal D}$ that define double groupoids, and whose\n$2$-morphisms are functors $\\mathbb{F}$ between double groupoid\n${\\mathcal D}$ diagrams\u2013 is called the *double groupoid 2-category*, or\nthe *2-category of double groupoids*.\n\n${\\mathcal G}^2$ is a relatively simple example of a category of\ndiagrams, or a 1-supercategory, $\\S_1$.\n\n[9]{}\n\nR.
