  "definition": "Definition.\n===========\n\nLet ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field\n$K$, and let $M$ be a . Our goal is to define a cochain complex\n$C^{k}({\\mathfrak{g}},M)$, whose cohomology is known as the Lie algebra\ncohomology of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ with coefficients in $M$. We define the\nspace of $k$-cochains to be\n$$C^k({\\mathfrak{g}},M)={\\operatorname{Hom}}_K(\\Lambda^k {\\mathfrak{g}},M),\\quad k=0,1,\\dots,\\dim {\\mathfrak{g}},$$\nthe vector space of multilinear, alternating mappings from\n$\\overbrace{{\\mathfrak{g}}\\times \\cdots\\times {\\mathfrak{g}}}^{k\\text{ times}}$\nto $M$. [^1] The coboundary operator\n$\\delta: C^k({\\mathfrak{g}},M)\\to C^{k+1}({\\mathfrak{g}},M)$ is defined\nto be $$\\begin{aligned}\n    (\\delta \\omega)(a_0,a_1,\\dots, a_k) =& \\sum_{0\\leq i\\leq k} (-1)^k \n    a_i \\cdot\\omega(\\dots,\\widehat{a_i},\\dots) + \\\\ \n    &\\ +\n    \\sum_{0\\leq i<j\\leq k}\n    (-1)^{i+j} \\omega([a_i,a_j],\\dots, \\widehat{a_i},\\dots\n    \\widehat{a_j},\\dots ),\\quad \\omega\\in C^k({\\mathfrak{g}},M),\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $\\widehat{a_i}$ indicates the omission of the argument $a_i$. We\nleave it as an exercise for the reader to check that $\\delta\n\\omega$, as defined above, is multi-linear, and alternating. Another,\nonly slightly more challenging exercise, is to prove that $\\delta^2\n=0$. The proof involves, in an essential way, the Jacobi identity, and\nthe commutator identity for the action of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ on $M$,\nnamely\n$$a\\cdot (b\\cdot u) - b\\cdot(a\\cdot u) = [a,b] \\cdot u,\\quad a,b\\in\n{\\mathfrak{g}},\\; u\\in M.$$\n\nIf ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is the tangent space of a Lie group, and $M$ is the\nreals with $0$ ${\\mathfrak{g}}$- action, then any alternating map on\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$ extends to a smooth alternating form on the Lie group,\nvia (left)- translation by the group action. The above formula for the\ncoboundary gives the exterior derivative with respect to this extension.\n\nInfinite-dimensional generalizations.\n=====================================\n\nThe above definition generalizes readily to infinite-dimensional Lie\nalgebras. The notion of a linear mapping with an infinite-dimensional\ndomain is quite tricky, and so the key requirement of any such\ngeneralization is some kind of restriction on the space of cochains.\nThus, de Rham cohomology of a manifold $X$ can be regarded as\n$H^k(V(X), C^\\infty(X))$, the cohomology of the Lie algebra of vector\nfields with coefficients that are smooth functions, with the caveat that\nthe cochain spaces $C^k(V(X),C^\\infty(X))$ are restricted to\n$\\Omega^k(X)$, the smooth differential forms[^2]. Another interesting\ninfinite-dimensional generalization is the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology of\n$V(X)$. Here we are allowed cochains that are not simply linear\ncombinations of the components of a vector field, but that also include\nthe derivatives of these components.\n\nApplications.\n=============\n\nOwing to numerous and useful various applications, it\u2019s useful to list\nthe formulas for the first few coboundary operators: $$\\begin{aligned}\n  (\\delta \\alpha)(a) =& a\\cdot \\alpha;\\\\\n  (\\delta \\beta)(a,b) =& a\\cdot \\beta(b) - b\\cdot \\beta(a)-\n  \\beta([a,b]);\\\\\n  (\\delta \\gamma)(a,b,c) =& a\\cdot \\gamma(b,c) +b\\cdot\\gamma(c,a) +\n  c\\cdot\\gamma(a,b) - \\gamma([a,b],c) - \\gamma([b,c],a) - \\gamma([c,a],b),\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $a,b,c\\in {\\mathfrak{g}}$, and where $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$ are\n$0, 1$, and $2$-cochains, respectively. In particular, for small $k$,\nthe cohomology groups $H^k({\\mathfrak{g}},M)$ have certain interesting\ninterpretations.\n\nThe first cohomology space, $H^1({\\mathfrak{g}},K)$ is isomorphic as a\nvector space to ${\\mathfrak{g}}/[{\\mathfrak{g}},{\\mathfrak{g}}]$, the\nabelianization of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. More generally\n$H^1({\\mathfrak{g}},M)$ classifies, up to natural equivalence, Lie\nalgebras consisting of inhomogeneous operators\n$$a+\\beta(a),\\quad a\\in {\\mathfrak{g}},\\; \\beta\\in C^1({\\mathfrak{g}},M).$$\nIn more fancy language, such operators are called derivations of $T(M)$,\nthe tensor algebra of $M$.\n\nThe second cohomology space, $H^2({\\mathfrak{g}},M)$, is naturally\nisomorphic to the vector space of abelian extensions of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$\nby $M$. Thinking of $M$ as an abelian Lie algebra, such an extension is\na Lie algebra $\\hat{{\\mathfrak{g}}}$ that occurs in the short-exact\nsequence $$0\\to M\\to\\hat{{\\mathfrak{g}}}\\to{\\mathfrak{g}}\\to 0.$$\n\nThe third cohomology space has an interesting interpretation in terms of\ndeformations of something or other. This is due to Murray Gerstenhaber\nof U. Penn, but I\u2019ve forgotten the details.\n\nHomological algebra.\n====================\n\nGeneralizing a bit, Lie algebra cohomology is just the cohomology of a\nparticular kind of algebraic theory. There are analogous cohomology\ntheories for groups, associative algebras, and commutative rings. All\nthese theories can be unified by employing the notion of an injective\nresolution.\n\nBroadening the scope even further, we can employ category theory and\nre-conceptualize Lie algebra cohomology as a functor from the category\nof ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-modules to the category of cochain complexes. One\nbegins with the covariant, left-exact functor\n$$(-)^{\\mathfrak{g}}: M\\mapsto M^{{\\mathfrak{g}}}=\\{u\\in M : {\\mathfrak{g}}\\cdot u=0 \\}$$\nfrom the category of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-modules to the category of\n$K$-vector spaces. One then defines $H^k({\\mathfrak{g}},-)$ to be the\nright-derived functors $R^k((-)^{{\\mathfrak{g}}})$.\n\nHistorical notes.\n=================\n\nLie algebra cohomology was first formalized in an influential 1948 paper\nby C. Chevalley and S. Eilenberg[@CE48]. The aim was to calculate the\ncohomology, in the topological sense, of a compact Lie group by using\nthe finite-dimensional data of the corresponding Lie algebra. In this\nthey were inspired by an even earlier idea of Elie Cartan, who was the\nfirst to announce that there was a connection between the topology of a\nLie group and the algebraic structure of the underlying Lie algebra\n[@C28]. What makes this story particularly interesting is that\nHomological Algebra, as a subject, was launched by the remarkable 1956\nbook[@CE56] by Cartan and Eilenberg called, oddly enough \u201cHomological\nAlgebra\u201d. However the Cartan involved this time is not Elie, but Henri,\nthe equally remarkable son of the very remarkable Elie. A survey of the\nhistory of homological algebra by Charles Weibel is available at the\nK-theory archive[@CW99].\n\n[99]{} E. Cartan, Sur les nombres de Betti des espaces de groupes clos,\n*C. R.
