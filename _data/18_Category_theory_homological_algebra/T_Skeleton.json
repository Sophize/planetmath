  "definition": "A subcategory $\\mathcal{S}$ of a category $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to be\n*skeletal*, or a *skeleton* of $\\mathcal{C}$ if\n\n-   the inclusion functor is an , and\n\n-   no two objects of $\\mathcal{S}$ are isomorphic.\n\nEquivalently, a subcategory $\\mathcal{S}$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a skeleton\nof $\\mathcal{C}$ if it is a isomorphism-dense full subcategory such that\nno two of its objects are isomorphic.\n\nFor example, in the category of sets, objects are isomorphic if and only\nif they have the same cardinality. So a skeleton of the category of sets\ncould include as objects a unique set from each class of sets of the\nsame cardinality, for each cardinality. If this is done, then any two\nobjects in the skeleton have different cardinalities, so are not\nisomorphic.\n\n**Remark**. From the example above, we see that there may be more than\none skeleton in any given category. However, as natural equivalence is\nan equivalence relation on the class of subcategories of a category, any\ntwo skeletons are naturally equivalent, since they are both naturally\nequivalent to the original category. Therefore, we may think of a\nskeleton as uniquely defined by the category, and this uniqueness is\nunderstood to be up to natural equivalence. In summary, any two\nskeletons of a category are isomorphic.\n\nWe may manufacture a skeleton out of a given small category. Let\n$\\mathcal{C}$ be a (small) category and $\\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$\nbe the set of objects in $\\mathcal{C}$. Define $\\sim$ on\n$\\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$ by $A \\sim B$ iff $A$ is isomorphic to\n$B$. Then it is easily checked that $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation on\n$\\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the category\nconsisting of, as objects, one object from each equivalence class under\n$\\sim$ for each equivalence class. This is permitted by the axiom of\nchoice. As morphisms of $\\mathcal{S}$, we grab all the\n$\\mathcal{C}$-morphisms between $S_1$ and $S_2$ for any two\n$S_1,S_2\\in \\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{S})$. It is not hard to verify\nthat $\\mathcal{S}$ is indeed a skeleton of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nIn general, however, a category may not have skeletons, and even if it\ndoes, its skeleton may not be small. A category with a small skeleton is\ncalled an *essentially small* or *skeletally small* category.",
