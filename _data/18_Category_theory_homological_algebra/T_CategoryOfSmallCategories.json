  "definition": "The category **Cat** of small categories consists of all small\ncategories as objects, and, functors between small categories as\nmorphisms. The composition of morphisms in **Cat** is the functor\ncomposition, and, associated with each small category, the identity\nfunctor acts as the identity morphism. Now, **Cat** is indeed a\ncategory, since $\\hom(\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D})$, the class of all\nfunctors from $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{D}$ is a set. The proof of this\nfact can be found .\n\nHere are some of the basic properties of **Cat**:\n\n1.  It has\n\n2.  It has\n\n3.  Initial object exists: the initial object is the empty category and\n    the associated empty functor.\n\n4.  Terminal object exists: the terminal object is any trivial category\n    and the associated constant functor into the trival category.\n\n5.  It has pullbacks. See . So it has equalizers, and therefore, it is\n    complete.\n\n6.  however, it does have coequalizers. This, together with 2 above,\n    shows that it is cocomplete.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   If we replace functors in $\\hom(\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D})$ by natural\n    transformations between pairs of functors from $\\mathcal{C}$ to\n    $\\mathcal{D}$, and composition of morphisms the horizontal\n    composition $\\circ$ of natural transformations, then we again end up\n    with a category (provided that both $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$\n    are small). Indeed, every natural transformation $\\eta$ between two\n    functors from $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{D}$ is a set function from\n    the *set* of objects of $\\mathcal{C}$ to the *set* of morphisms of\n    $\\mathcal{D}$. As a result, $\\hom(\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D})$ is a\n    subcollection of the *set* of *all* functions from\n    $\\operatorname{Ob}(\\mathcal{C})$ to\n    $\\operatorname{Mor}(\\mathcal{D})$, and hence a set. For more detail,\n    please see .\n\n-   In fact, **Cat** has the structure of a 2-category, where the small\n    categories are the $0$-cells, the functors between them are the\n    $1$-cells, and the natural transformations between parallel functors\n    are the $2$-cells.\n\n-   If we remove the requirement that each object in **Cat** be small,\n    then $\\hom(\\mathcal{C},\\mathcal{D})$ may no longer be a set, and we\n    end up with a large category.",
