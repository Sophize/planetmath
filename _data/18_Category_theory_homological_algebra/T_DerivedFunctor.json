  "definition": "Let ${{\\mathcal{A}}},{{\\mathcal{B}}}$ be abelian categories,\n${{\\mathcal{A}}}$ having enough injectives, and\n$F:{{\\mathcal{A}}}\\to{{\\mathcal{B}}}$ be a covariant .\n\nGiven an object $A\\in {{\\mathcal{A}}}$, we can construct an injective\nresolution\n$$\\xymatrix{A\\to \\mathbf{A}\\colon 0\\ar[r]& A\\ar[r]& I^1\\ar[r]& I^2\\ar[r]&\\cdots}$$\nwhich is unique up to chain homotopy equivalence. Then we apply the\nfunctor $F$ to the injectives in the resolution to to get a complex\n$$\\xymatrix{F(\\mathbf{A})\\colon 0\\ar[r]&F(I^1)\\ar[r]& F(I^2)\\ar[r]&\\cdots}$$\n(notice that the term involving $A$ has been left out. This is not an\naccident, in fact, it is crucial). This complex is also independent of\nthe choice of $I$\u2019s (up to chain homotopy equivalence). Now, we define\nthe *classical right derived functors* $R^iF(A)$ to be the cohomology\ngroups $H^i(F(\\mathbf{A}))$. These only depend on $A$.\n\nA completely analogous construction can be carried out for right-exact\nfunctors and for contravariant functors exact on either side, but it is\ntraditional to only describe one case, as doing the others mostly\nconsists of reversing arrows (and replacing \u201cinjective\u201d with projective\nwhen appropriate), and the result is that of a left derived functor\n$L^iF$ for a given right-exact covariant functor $F$ via a projective\nresolution.\n\nImportant properties of the classical derived functors are these: If the\nsequence $0\\to A\\to A'\\to A''\\to 0$ is exact, then there is a long exact\nsequence\n$$\\xymatrix{0\\ar[r]&F(A)\\ar[r]& F(A')\\ar[r]& F(A'')\\ar[r]& R^1F(A)\\ar[r]&\\cdots}$$\nwhich is natural (a morphism of short exact sequences induces a morphism\nof long exact sequences). This, along with a couple of other properties\ndetermine the derived functors completely, giving an axiomatic\ndefinition, though the construction used above is usually necessary to\nshow existence. One can often confirm that some other functors\nconstructed in some different way are equal to the right derived\nfunctors by checking that they satisfy these properties; such a proof is\ncalled a \u201cuniversal $\\delta$-functor argument\u201d.\n\nFrom the definition, one can see immediately that the following are\nequivalent:\n\n1.  $F$ is exact\n\n2.  $R^nF(A)=0$ for $n\\geq 1$ and all $A\\in {{\\mathcal{A}}}$.\n\n3.  $R^1F(A)=0$ for all $A\\in {{\\mathcal{A}}}$.\n\nHowever, $R^1F(A)=0$ for a particular $A$ does not imply that\n$R^nF(A)=0$ for all $n\\geq 1$.\n\nImportant examples are:\n\n-   The Ext functors $\\mathrm{Ext}^n$ are the right derived functors of\n    $\\mathrm{Hom}$.\n\n-   The Tor functors $\\mathrm{Tor}_n$ are the left derived functors of\n    the tensor product.\n\n-   Sheaf cohomology arises as the right derived functors of the global\n    section functor on sheaves.\n\n-   Group cohomology arises as the right derived functors of the \u201cfixed\n    submodule\u201d functor on the category of $G$-modules for some group\n    $G$.\n\n-   \u00c9tale cohomology arises as the right derived functors of the global\n    sections functor on the category of \u00e9tale sheaves; this example\n    includes as special cases the previous two.",
