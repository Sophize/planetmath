  "definition": "A morphism $f:A\\to B$ in a category $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to be\n*orthogonal* to a morphism $g:C\\to D$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, written\n$$f\\perp g$$ if whenever we have a commutative diagram\n$$\\xymatrix@+=3pc{A \\ar[r]^f \\ar[d] & B \\ar[d] \\\\ C \\ar[r]_g & D}$$\nthere is a unique morphism $h:B\\to C$ such that the diagram\n$$\\xymatrix@+=3pc{A \\ar[r]^f \\ar[d] & B \\ar[d] \\ar@{.>}[dl]|h \\\\ C \\ar[r]_g & D}$$\nis commutative also. If $f\\perp g$, we sometimes call the ordered pair\n$(f,g)$ a *diagonally polar pair*.\n\nFor example, in **Set**, the category of sets, any surjective function\nis orthogonal to an injective function. To see this, suppose $f:A\\to B$\nis surjective and $g:C\\to D$ injective, with $y\\circ f= g\\circ x$, where\n$x:A\\to C$ and $y:B\\to D$ are functions. For any $b\\in B$, there is some\n$a\\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ since $f$ is surjective. Define $h:B\\to C$\nby $h(b)=x(a)$. Now, if there is $c\\in A$ such that $b=f(a)=f(c)$, then\n$g(x(a))= y(f(a))=y(b)=y(f(c))=g(x(c))$. Since $g$ is injective,\n$x(a)=x(c)$. This shows that $h$ is a well-defined function. It is clear\nthat $h\\circ f=x$ and $g\\circ h=y$. Now, if $e:B\\to C$ is another such a\nfunction, then $g(e(b))=y(b)=g(h(b))$, so that $e(b)=h(b)$ since $g$ is\ninjective. This shows that $h$ is uniquely defined.\n\nHere are some basic properties of the orthogonality relation on\nmorphisms:\n\n-   If either $f$ or $g$ is an isomorphism, then $f\\perp g$.\n\n-   If $f\\perp f$, then $f$ is an isomorphism.\n\n-   If $f\\perp g$ and $f\\perp h$, then $f\\perp (h\\circ g)$. Similarly,\n    $g\\perp f$ and $h\\perp f$ imply $(h\\circ g)\\perp f$. Of course, both\n    statements make sense provided that $h\\circ g$ exists.\n\nMore generally, if $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ are two classes of\nmorphisms in a category $\\mathcal{C}$, we say that $\\mathcal{F}$ is\n*orthogonal* to $\\mathcal{G}$, or that $(\\mathcal{F},\\mathcal{G})$ is a\n*diagonally polar pair*, written $\\mathcal{F}\\perp \\mathcal{G}$, if\n$f\\perp g$ for every $f$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ and every $g$ in\n$\\mathcal{G}$.\n\nFor every class $\\mathcal{X}$ of morphism, the largest class of\nmorphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\mathcal{X}$ is orthogonal to is\ndenoted by $\\mathcal{X}_*$, and the largest class of morphisms that is\northogonal to $\\mathcal{X}$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{X}^*$.\n\nBased on the properties of $\\perp$ above, below are some properties of\n$^*$ and $_*$:\n\n-   $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}_*$ iff\n    $\\mathcal{Y}\\subseteq \\mathcal{X}^*$. Equivalently, if $\\mathscr{M}$\n    is the class of all subclasses of morphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$, then\n    $(-^*,-_*)$ is a Galois connection between $(\\mathscr{M},\\subseteq)$\n    and $(\\mathscr{M},\\supseteq)$.\n\n-   A morphism is in both $\\mathcal{X}^*$ and $\\mathcal{X}_*$ iff it is\n    an isomorphism.\n\n-   Both $\\mathcal{X}^*$ and $\\mathcal{X}_*$ are closed under $\\circ$.\n\n-   Given that $m=m_1\\circ m_2$ exists in $\\mathcal{C}$ and\n    $m_2\\in \\mathcal{X}_*$, then $m \\in \\mathcal{X}_*$ iff\n    $m_1\\in \\mathcal{X}_*$.\n\n-   If $f\\in \\mathcal{X}_*$, then the pullback of $f$ along any morphism\n    is again in $\\mathcal{X}_*$.\n\n[9]{} F.
