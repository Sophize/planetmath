  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category. $\\mathcal{A}$ is said to have\n*enough projectives* if, for every object $A$ of $\\mathcal{A}$, there is\na projective object $P$ of $\\mathcal{A}$ and an exact sequence\n$$\\xymatrix{P \\ar[r]^p & A \\ar[r] & 0}.$$ In other words, the map\n$p\\colon P \\to A$ is epi, or an epimorphism.\n\n**Example.** Let $R$ be a ring. The category of left (right) $R$-modules\nis an abelian category having enough projectives. This is true since,\nfor every left (right) $R$-module $M$, we can take $F$ to be the free\n(and hence projective) $R$-module generated by a generating set $X$ for\n$M$ (we can in fact take $X$ to be $M$). Then the canonical projection\n$\\pi\\colon F\\to M$ is the required surjection.\n\nMore generally, a category $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to have *enough\nprojectives* if every object is a strong quotient object of a projective\nobject.\n\n[9]{} F.
