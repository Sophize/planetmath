  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $D$ a in $\\mathcal{C}$. A *cone\nover* $D$ consists of the following:\n\n1.  an object $a$ of $\\mathcal{C}$,\n\n2.  a morphism $f:a\\to d$ for each object $d$ in $D$,\n\n3.  a commutative triangle $$\\xymatrix{\n    & a \\ar[dl]_{f_1} \\ar[dr]^{f_2} & \\\\\n    d_1 \\ar[rr]^g && d_2\n    }$$ for every morphism $g:d_1\\to d_2$ in $D$.\n\nA cone over $D$ is denoted by $\\lbrace a\\to d\\mid d\\in D\\rbrace$, or\nsimply $a\\to D$.\n\nA *limiting cone* over $D$ is a cone over $D$, $c\\to D$, such that for\nany cone $a\\to D$, there is a unique morphism $h: a\\to c$ such that the\ndiagram $$\\xymatrix{\na \\ar[rr]^h \\ar[dr]_{x} && c \\ar[dl]^{y} \\\\\n& d & \n}$$ is commutative for every object $d$ of $D$. If a diagram $D$ has a\nlimiting cone, then $D$ is said to have a *limit*.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   If $D$ is a subcategory of $\\mathcal{C}$, then a cone over $D$ is\n    the comma category $(a,D)$, where objects are identified with\n    morphisms $a\\to d$ for each $d\\in D$, morphisms are identified with\n    morphisms $f:d_1\\to d_2$ in $D$. The identity morphism for each\n    $d\\in D$ is $1_d$, and composition of morphisms is defined in terms\n    of composition of morphisms in $D$.\n\n-   Any two limiting cones of a diagram $D$ are isomorphic in the sense\n    that if $c_1\\to D$ and $c_2\\to D$ are limiting cones, then there are\n    morphisms $p:c_1\\to c_2$ and $q:c_2\\to c_1$ such that $pq=1_{c_2}$\n    and $qp=1_{c_1}$.\n\n-   We may form a category from the collection of all cones over a\n    diagram $D$ as follows:\n\n    -   objects are cones over $D$,\n\n    -   a morphism from a cones $a\\to D$ and a cone $b\\to D$ is a\n        morphism $h: a\\to b$ such that $$\\xymatrix{\n        a \\ar[rr]^h \\ar[dr]_{x} && b \\ar[dl]^{y} \\\\\n        & d & \n        }$$ is a commutative triangle.\n\n    Clearly, identity morphisms and compositions of morphisms can then\n    be defined accordingly.\n\n-   From the above construction of the category of cones over $D$, a\n    limiting cone is just a terminal object in that category.\n\n**Examples**\n\n1.  If $D$ consists of a single object $d$, then a limiting cone, which\n    always exists, is the identity morphism $1_d:d\\to d$.\n\n2.  If $D$ is the empty set (no objects and no morphisms), a limiting\n    cone over $D$ is just a terminal object in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n3.  If $D$ consists of two objects $a,b$ without any morphisms, then the\n    limiting cone is the product of the two objects $a\\times b$.\n\n4.  If $D$ has the following diagram $$\\xymatrix{\n    &  a\\ar[d]^x \\\\\n    b\\ar[r]^y & c\n    }$$ then the limiting cone is the pullback, written $a\\times_c b$.\n    If $c$ is a terminal object, then $a\\times_c b \\cong a\\times b$.\n\n5.  If $D$ consists of a pair of morphisms $x,y$ from $a$ to $b$, then\n    the limiting cone over $D$ is the equalizer of $x$ and $y$.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n-   If all arrows (morphisms) are reversed, we have a cone under a\n    diagram $D$. A cone under a diagram $D$ is also known as a *cocone*\n    for $D$. The dual concept of a limiting cone is thus a limiting\n    cocone, which is an initial object in the category of cocones. All\n    of the examples cited above can be dualized, and the respective\n    results are an identity morphism, an initial object, a coproduct, a\n    pushout, and a coequalizer.\n\n-   All of the above concepts can be generalized, and we may speak of\n    the limit of a functor, more commonly known as the inverse limit.\n    The dual notion is that of a direct limit.
