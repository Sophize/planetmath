  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Then $\\mathcal{C}$ is an *additive\ncategory* if\n\n1.  $\\mathcal{C}$ is a preadditive category, and\n\n2.  for every pair of objects $A,B$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, their exists.\n\n**Proposition**. In a preadditive category, coproduct of two objects\nexists iff their product exists. Furthermore, they are isomorphic.\n\nWe shall prove the fact if the product $D$ of objects $A$ and $B$\nexists, then $D$ is also their coproduct. The other direction is dual.\n\nSuppose $D$ is the product of $A$ and $B$, with morphisms\n$$\\xymatrix@1{D\\ar[r]^{\\pi_A}&A}\\qquad\\mbox{ and }\\qquad\\xymatrix@1{D\\ar[r]^{\\pi_B}&B}.$$\nFrom these two morphisms, we construct two commutative diagrams\n$$\\xymatrix{&A \\\\ A \\ar[ur]^1 \\ar[dr]_0 \\ar@{-->}[r]^{\\alpha} & D\n\\ar[u]_{\\pi_A} \\ar[d]^{\\pi_B}\\\\ &B}\n\\qquad\\mbox{ and }\\qquad\n\\xymatrix{&A \\\\ B \\ar[ur]^0 \\ar[dr]_1 \\ar@{-->}[r]^{\\beta} & D\n\\ar[u]_{\\pi_A} \\ar[d]^{\\pi_B}\\\\ &B}$$ where $0$ and $1$ are zero\nmorphisms and identity morphisms on $A$ and $B$, and $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are morphisms based on the definition of the product $D$.\n\nThen it\u2019s not hard to see that $D$ is a coproduct of $A$ and $B$ with\nmorphisms $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, for if $r:A\\rightarrow C$ and\n$s:B\\rightarrow C$ are two morphisms into an object $C$, we can form two\nmorphisms $r\\pi_A$ and $s\\pi_B$, both from $D$ to $C$. Since\n$\\operatorname{hom}(D,C)$ is an abelian group, these two can then be\nadded to form $f:=r\\pi_A+s\\pi_B$. Then\n$f\\alpha=(r\\pi_A+s\\pi_B)\\alpha=r$, and similarly $f\\beta=s$. This shows\nthat $D$ is also the coproduct of $A$ and $B$ with morphisms $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$.\n\nAn easy way to remember the relationships among the various morphisms in\nthe above proof are the following two matrix products:\n\n$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\pi_A \\\\\n\\pi_B \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & \\beta \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\qquad\n\\mbox{ and } \n\\qquad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nr & s \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\pi_A \\\\\n\\pi_B \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=f$.\n\nAs a result of the above proposition, in an additive category, finite\nproducts and finite coproducts are synonymous. Given objects $A,B$, we\ndenote $A\\oplus B$ to be their product. We also call it the *direct sum*\nof $A$ and $B$.\n\nMany preadditive categories are also examples of additive categories.\nThe category $\\textbf{CyclGrp}$ of cyclic groups as the subcategory of\nthe category of abelian groups is an example of a preadditive category\nthat is not additive, for the product of two cyclic groups\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/q \\mathbb{Z}$ exists in\n$\\textbf{CyclGrp}$ only when $p$ and $q$ are coprime.",
