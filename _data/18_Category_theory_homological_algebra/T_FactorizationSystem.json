  "definition": "Recall that any function $f:A\\to B$ can be factored as $h\\circ g$ where\n$g:A\\to f(A)$ is a surjection and $h:f(A)\\to B$ is an injection. This\nphenomenon is true in many mathematical systems: homomorphisms between\ngroups, rings, lattices, continuous maps between topological spaces,\netc...\n\nHowever, in the setting of category theory, while it is still true that\na morphism can be factored into the composition of two morphisms (one of\nthem, say, being the identity morphism), the fact that one factor is an\nepimorphism and the other a monomorphism no longer holds in general.\nCategories where such kinds of factorizations exist is of great\ninterest. Factorization of morphisms in a category can be formalized as\nfollows:\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category. An ordered pair\n$(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$ of classes of morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$ is\ncalled a *factorization system* if\n\n-   every morphism $f$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ can be \u201cfactored\u201d as\n    $f=m\\circ e$ where $m\\in \\mathcal{M}$ and $e\\in \\mathcal{E}$,\n\n-   $\\mathcal{E}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathcal{M}$:\n    $\\mathcal{E} \\perp \\mathcal{M}$,\n\n-   every isomorphism is in both $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$, and\n\n-   both $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ are closed under composition;\n    in other words, if $x,y$ are both in one class and $x\\circ y$ is\n    defined, then $x\\circ y$ is in that class too.\n\nWhen there is a factorization system $(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$ on a\ncategory $\\mathcal{C}$, we say that $\\mathcal{C}$ *has\n$(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$-factorization*, and an\n*$(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$-factorization* of a morphism $f$ is a\nfactorization of $f$: $f=m\\circ e$, such that $m\\in \\mathcal{M}$ and\n$e\\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n\nOne of the first properties of having a factorization system\n$(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$ is that the\n$(\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{M})$-factorization of a morphism $f$ is unique up\nto isomorphism:\n\nIf we have a commutative diagram\n$$\\xymatrix@+=1.5cm{A \\ar[dr]^f \\ar[r]^s \\ar[d]_t & C \\ar[d]^u \\\\ D \\ar[r]_v & B}$$\nwhere $s,t\\in \\mathcal{E}$ and $u,v\\in \\mathcal{M}$, then $C\\cong D$.\n\nBecause $\\mathcal{E}\\perp \\mathcal{M}$, there are unique morphisms\n$g:C\\to D$ and $h:D\\to C$ such that the diagram\n$$\\xymatrix@+=1.5cm{A \\ar[r]^s \\ar[d]_t & C \\ar[d]^u \\ar@<-0.5ex>[dl]_g \\\\ D \\ar[r]_v \\ar@<-0.5ex>[ur]_h & B}$$\nis commutative. Then $h\\circ g\\circ s = h \\circ t = s$ and\n$u \\circ h\\circ g = v \\circ g = u$, which means we have a commutative\ndiagram\n$$\\xymatrix@+=1.5cm{A \\ar[r]^s \\ar[d]_s & C \\ar[d]^u \\ar[dl]|{h\\circ g} \\\\ C \\ar[r]_u & B}$$\nBut $s\\perp u$, so the morphism $h\\circ g: C\\to C$ making the above\ndiagram commute is uniquely determined. Since $1_C:C \\to C$ is another\nmorphism making the diagram commute, we must have $h\\circ g=1_C$.\nSimilarly, one sees that $g\\circ h=1_D$. This implies that $C\\cong D$.\n\nMore to come...\n\n[9]{} F. Borceux *Basic Category Theory, Handbook of Categorical Algebra\nI*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1994)",
