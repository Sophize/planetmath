  "definition": "In category theory, there are at least two inequivalent ways to define\n\u201crelations\u201d between objects of a category. Both definitions are direct\ngeneralizations of ordinary relations between sets. In this entry, we\nfix a category $\\mathcal{C}$, and only look at binary relations, as\nrelations of higher arity can be easily formulated.\n\nDefinition 1 {#definition-1 .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nThe first definition is the generalization of the fact that a relation\nbetween sets $A, B$ is just a subset $R$ of the cartesian product\n$A\\times B$.\n\n**Definition**. Let $A,B$ be objects in $\\mathcal{C}$. A *relation* from\n$A$ to $B$ is a subobject $R$ of the categorical direct product\n$A \\times B$. We often write $R\\subseteq A\\times B$ to denote that $R$\nis a relation from $A$ to $B$.\n\nOne potential drawback with this definition is that $R$ itself is not an\nobject in $\\mathcal{C}$, as $R$ is an equivalence class of monomorphisms\ninto $A\\times B$. Another, possibly bigger, drawback is that a relation\nis only defined if the product of $A\\times B$ exists.\n\nFor example, in **Set**, the category of sets, a relation between sets\n$A$ and $B$ is an equivalence class $[S]$ of a subset\n$S\\subseteq A\\times B$. In other words, take a subset $S$ of $A\\times B$\nand form the class of all sets (in **Sets**) equipollent to $S$.\n\nDefinition 2 {#definition-2 .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nThe second definition looks at the functional properties of a binary\nrelation between sets $A$ and $B$. If $R$ is a relation from sets $A$ to\n$B$, it is a subset of $A\\times B$. Therefore, it has two projections\n$p_1\\!:\\!R\\to A$ and $p_2\\!:\\!R\\to B$, projecting $R$ onto the its first\nand second components respectively. Furthermore, $p_1$ and $p_2$ has the\nproperties that they form a monomorphic pair.\n\n**Definition**. Let $A,B$ be objects in $\\mathcal{C}$. A *relation\nobject* from $A$ to $B$ is an object $R$ and an ordered pair of\nmorphisms $(p_1\\!:\\!R\\to A,p_2\\!:\\!R\\to B)$, such that $p_1,p_2$ form a\nmonomorphic pair. When $A=B$, we call $R$ a relation object on $A$.\n\nOne clear advantage of this definition is that there is no need to\nintroduce the notion of products (on objects) in this definition.\nAnother big advantage with this definition is that one gets an\nassociated a set-theorectic relation with each relation object:\n\n> For every relation object $R$ on $A$ and every object $C$, set\n> $$R_C:=\\lbrace (p_1\\circ f, p_2\\circ f) \\mid f \\in \\hom(C,R)\\rbrace.$$\n\nThen $R_C$ is a set relation from $\\hom(C,A)$ to $\\hom(C,B)$.\n\nSuppose now that $R$ is a relation object on $A$. Then $R_C$ is a set\nrelation on $\\hom(C,A)$. $R$ is said to be a *reflexive relation object,\nsymmetric relation object, transitive relation object*, or an\n*equivalence relation object* on $A$ iff the induced relation $R_C$ is\nreflexive, symmetric, transitive, or equivalence on $\\hom(C,A)$ for\nevery object $C$.\n\nFor example, a relation object $R$ on an object $A$ in **Set** is just\nthe oridinary binary relation on the set $A$. We also have the\nfollowing: $R$ is reflexive (symmetric, transitive, or equivalence)\nrelation object iff $R$ is reflexive (symmetric, transitive, or\nequivalence) relation.\n\nThere are three parts to this proof:\n\n1.  (reflexivity). $(\\Rightarrow)$. Suppose first that $R$ is a\n    reflexive relation object on $A$. Let $C$ be the diagonal relation\n    on $A$, and $f:C\\to A$ a function given by $f(a,a)=a$. Since $R_C$\n    is a reflexive relation on set $\\hom(C,A)$, there is a function\n    $g:C\\to R$ such that $p_1\\circ g= f = p_2 \\circ g$. As $g$ can be\n    written as $(g_1,g_2)$, with each $g_i=p_i\\circ g$, we get\n    $g=(f,f)$. This shows that $(a,a) = (f(a,a),f(a,a)) = g(a,a) \\in R$\n    for all $a\\in A$. Therefore, $R$ is a reflexive relation on $A$.\n\n    $(\\Leftarrow)$. Suppose now that $R$ is a reflexive relation on set\n    $A$. Let $C$ be an arbitrary set and $f:C\\to A$ and arbitrary\n    function from $C$ to $A$. We get a function $f':C\\to A\\times A$ by\n    setting $f'(c)=(f(c),f(c))$. Since $R$ is reflexive, $f'$ maps $C$\n    into $R$. But $(f,f) = (p_1\\circ f', p_2\\circ f')\\in R_C$, we have\n    that $R_C$ is reflexive. Since $C$ is arbitrary, $R$ is a reflexive\n    relation object on $A$.\n\n2.  (symmetry). $(\\Rightarrow)$. Suppose $R$ is a symmetric relation\n    object on $A$, and suppose $(a,b)\\in R$, where $a,b\\in A$. Let\n    $C=\\lbrace (b,a)\\rbrace$. Define $f:C\\to R$ by $f(b,a)=(a,b)$. Since\n    $(p_1\\circ f, p_2\\circ f)\\in R_C$, which is symmetric on\n    $\\hom(C,A)$, there is a $g = (g_1,g_2):C\\to R$ such that\n    $(g_1,g_2)= (p_1\\circ g, p_2\\circ g)=(p_2\\circ f,p_1\\circ f)$. So\n    $(b,a)=(p_2(a,b),p_1(a,b))=(p_2\\circ f(b,a),p_1\\circ f(b,a))=(g_1(b,a),g_2(b,a)) = g(b,a)\\in R$,\n    which means that $R$ is a symmetric relation on $A$.\n\n    $(\\Leftarrow)$. Now suppose that $R$ is a symmetric relation on set\n    $A$. Let $C$ be an arbitrary set with\n    $(p_1\\circ f, p_2\\circ f)\\in R_C$, where $f:C\\to R$ is some\n    function. Since $R$ is symmetric, $t:R\\to R$ given by $t(a,b)=(b,a)$\n    is well-defined. We also have the equations $p_1=p_2\\circ t$ and\n    $p_2=p_1\\circ t$. As a result,\n    $(p_2\\circ f, p_1\\circ f) = (p_1\\circ t\\circ f, p_2\\circ t\\circ f) \\in R_C$\n    as well, showing that $R_C$ is symmetric on $\\hom(C,A)$. But $C$ is\n    arbitrary, $R$ is a symmetric relation object on $A$.\n\n3.  (transitivity). $(\\Rightarrow)$. Suppose $R$ is a transitive\n    relation object on $A$, with $(a,b),(b,c)\\in R$. Let\n    $C=\\lbrace (a,c)\\rbrace$, where $a,b,c\\in A$.. Define $f,g:C\\to R$\n    by $f(a,c)=(a,b)$ and $g(a,c)=(b,c)$. Write\n    $f=(f_1,f_2)=(p_1\\circ f, p_2\\circ f)$ and\n    $g=(g_1,g_2)=(p_1\\circ g,p_2\\circ g)$. Since $f_2(a,c)=b=g_1(a,c)$,\n    and $R_C$ is transitive, we must have $(f_1,g_2)\\in R_C$, which\n    means that there is $h:C\\to R$ with\n    $h=(h_1,h_2)=(p_1\\circ h, p_2\\circ h) =(f_1,g_2)$. But this implies\n    that $(a,c)=(f_1(a,c),g_2(a,c))=h(a,c)\\in R$. As a result, $R$ is a\n    transitive relation on set $A$.\n\n    $(\\Leftarrow)$. Now suppose that $R$ is a transitive relation on set\n    $A$. Let $C$ be an arbitrary set with\n    $f=(f_1,f_2)=(p_1\\circ f,p_2\\circ f), g=(g_1,g_2)=(p_1\\circ g,p_2\\circ g)\\in R_C$.\n    Suppose $f_2=g_1=x:C\\to A$. Define $h:C\\to A\\times A$ by\n    $h(c)=(f_1(c),g_2(c))$. Since\n    $(f_1(c),x(c))=(f_1(c),f_2(c))=f(c) \\in R$ and\n    $(x(c),g_2(c))= (g_1(c),g_2(c))=g(c)\\in R$, we have\n    $(f_1(c),g_2(c))\\in R$ as $R$ is transitive. This shows that $h$\n    maps $C$ into $R$, or $(f_1,g_2)=h=(p_1\\circ h,p_2\\circ h)\\in R_C$.\n    So $R_C$ is transitive. As $C$ is arbitrary, $R$ is a transitive\n    relation object on $A$.\n\nFinally, collecting all of the above results, we see that $R$ is an\nequivalence relation object on $A$ iff $R$ is an equivalence relation on\n$A$.\n\n**Remark**. Dually, one can define a *corelation* on objects. We invite\nthe reader to formulate the exact notion of a corelation from one object\nto another.\n\n[9]{} F.
