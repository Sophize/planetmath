  "definition": "A category is said to be *balanced* in case that every bimorphism is an\nisomorphism.\n\nFor example, **Set** (the cateogry of sets), **Grp** (the category of\ngroups), and **Top** (the category of topological spaces) are all\nbalanced. In these categories, morphisms that are monomorphic are\ninjective, and those that are epimorphic are surjective. Injective and\nsurjective morphisms are bijective, implying having two-sided inverses,\nand therefore isomorphisms.\n\nOn the other hand, the category **DivAbGrp**, the category of divisible\nabelian groups, is not balanced. The canonical projection\n$p:\\mathbb{Q}\\to \\mathbb{Q/Z}$ is clearly epimorphic, as well as\nmonomorphic (see ), and therefore bimorphic. However, $p$ is not an\nisomorphism.\n\nAs another example of a category that is not balanced, take the category\nof commutative rings with 1, **CommRng**. The canonical injection\n$i:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is clearly monomorphic, as well as\nepimorphic (see ), and therefore bimorphic. But $i$ is not an\nisomorphism.\n\n[9]{} C.
