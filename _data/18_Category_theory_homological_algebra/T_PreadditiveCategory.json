  "definition": "Ab-Category\n-----------\n\nA category $\\mathcal{C}$ is an *ab-category* or ***ab**-category* if\n\n1.  for every pair of objects $A,B$ of $\\mathcal{C}$, there is a binary\n    operation called addition, written $+_{(A,B)}$ or simply $+$,\n    defined on $\\operatorname{hom}(A,B)$,\n\n2.  the set $\\hom(A,B)$, together with $+$ is an abelian group,\n\n3.  (left distributivity) if $f,g\\in \\hom(A,B)$ and $h\\in \n    \\hom(B,C)$, then $h(f+g)=hf+hg$,\n\n4.  (right distributivity) if $f,g\\in \\hom(A,B)$ and $h\\in \n    \\hom(C,A)$, then $(f+g)h=fh+gh$.\n\nIn a nutshell, an *ab-category* is a category in which every hom set in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is an abelian group such that morphism composition\ndistributes over addition. Ab in the name stands for abelian, clearly\nindicative of the second condition above.\n\nSince a group has a multiplicative (or additive if abelian) identity,\n$\\hom(A,B)\\neq\\varnothing$ for every pair of objects $A,B$ in\n$\\mathcal{C}$. Furthermore, each $\\hom(A,B)$ contains a unique morphism,\nwritten $0_{(A,B)}$, as the additive identity of $\\hom(A,B)$. Because\nthe subset $$\\lbrace f\\cdot 0_{(A,B)}\\mid f\\in\\hom(B,C)\\rbrace$$ of\n$\\hom(A,C)$ is also a subgroup by right distributivity, and the additive\nidentity of a subgroup coincides with the additive identity of the\ngroup, we have the following identity $$0_{(B,C)}0_{(A,B)}=0_{(A,C)}.$$\n\nThere are many examples of ab-categories, including the category of\nabelian groups, the category of $R$-modules ($R$ a ring), the category\nof chain complexes, and the category of rings (not necessarily\ncontaining a multiplicative identity). However, the category of rings\nwith 1 is not an ab-category (see below for more detail). Nevertheless,\na unital ring $R$ itself considered as a category is an ab-category, as\nthe ring of endomorphisms clearly forms an abelian group. It is in fact\na ring! This can be seen as a special case of the fact that, in an\nab-category, $\\operatorname{End}(A)=\\hom(A,A)$ is always a ring (with\n1). So, conversely, an ab-category with one object is a ring with 1,\nwhose morphisms are elements of the ring.\n\nPreadditive Category\n--------------------\n\nIf an ab-category has an initial object, that object is also a terminal\nobject. By duality, the converse is also true. Therefore, in an\nab-category, initial object, terminal object, and zero object are\nsynonymous. In the category $\\mathcal{R}$ of unital rings, $\\mathbb{Z}$\nis an initial object, but it has no terminal object, therefore\n$\\mathcal{R}$ is not an ab-category.\n\nAn ab-category with a zero object $O$ is called a *preadditive\ncategory*.\n\nIn a preadditive category, the groups $\\hom(A,O)$ and $\\hom(O,B)$ are\ntrivial groups by the definition of the zero object $O$. Therefore, the\nzero morphism in $\\hom(A,B)$ is also the additive identity of\n$\\hom(A,B)$:\n$$0_{(A,B)}=0_{(O,B)}0_{(A,O)}=A\\longrightarrow O\\longrightarrow B.$$\n\nMost of the examples of ab-categories are readily seen to be\npreadditive. If a preadditive category $R$ has only one object, we see\nfrom above that it must be a ring. But this object must also be a zero\nobject, so that $\\operatorname{End}(R)$ must be trivial, which means $R$\nitself must be trivial too, $R=0$!\n\n**Remark**. In some literature, a preadditive category is an\nab-category, and some do not insist that a preadditive category contains\na zero object. Here, we choose to differentiate the two.",
