  "statement": "We will denote the equalizer of $f$ and $g$ by $e={\\mathrm{Eq}}(f,g)$.\n\nEvery regular monomorphism is a monomorphism. (Every regular epimorphism\nis an epimorphism.)\n\nLet $f={\\mathrm{Eq}}(r,s)$. Let $f\\circ g=f\\circ h$. Then\n$r\\circ(f\\circ g)=s\\circ(f\\circ g)$ and by the definition of the\nequalizer there exists a unique morphism $h$ such that $f\\circ g=f\\circ\nh$, thus $g=h$.\n\n\\[GFJEEXMONOIMPFEXJEMONO\\] If $g\\circ f$ is an extremal monomorphism,\nthen $f$ is an extremal monomorphism.\\\nIf $g\\circ f$ is an extremal epimorphism, then $g$ is an extremal\nepimorphism.\n\nSince $g\\circ f$ is a monomorphism, $f$ is a monomorphism too. Let\n$f=h\\circ e$ and $e$ be an epimorphism. Then $g\\circ f=g\\circ h\\circ e$,\nbut $g\\circ f$ is an extremal monomorphism, thus $e$ is an isomorphism.\n\nThe second part of the proposition is to the first part.\n\n\\[HIERMOR\\] If ${f:X\\toY}$ is a morphism then each of the following\nconditions implies the next one:\n\n1.  $f$ is an isomorphism\n\n2.  $f$ is a section\n\n3.  $f$ is a regular monomorphism\n\n4.  $f$ is an extremal monomorphism\n\n5.  $f$ is a monomorphism.\n\n(Dual claim: $f$ is an isomorphism $\\Rightarrow$ retraction\n$\\Rightarrow$ regular epimorphism $\\Rightarrow$ extremal epimorphism\n$\\Rightarrow$ epimorphism.)\n\n(i)$\\Rightarrow$(ii) straightforward from the definition.\n\n(ii)$\\Rightarrow$(iii) Let $g\\circ f=id_A$, we will show that\n$f={\\mathrm{Eq}}(id_B,f\\circ g)$. It holds\n$(f\\circ g)\\circ f=f\\circ(g\\circ f)=f\\circ id_A=f=id_B\\circ f$. If\n$(f\\circ g)\\circ\nh=h$ then $h=f\\circ(g\\circ h)$ and there is unique such morphism, since\n$f$ is a monomorphism (every section is a monomorphism).\n\n(iii)$\\Rightarrow$(iv) Let $f={\\mathrm{Eq}}(r,s)$ and $f=g\\circ e$ with\n$e$ an epimorphism. It holds:\n$(r\\circ g)\\circ e=r\\circ(g\\circ e)=r\\circ f=s\\circ f=s\\circ (g\\circ e)=(s\\circ g)\\circ e$,\nthus it holds $r\\circ g=s\\circ g$ as well (since $e$ is an epimorphism).\nBy the universal property in the definition of equalizer there exists a\nunique morphism $e'$ such that $g=f\\circ e'$. Thus we get\n$f\\circ id_A=f=g\\circ e=f\\circ e'\\circ e$ and $f$ is a monomorphism,\nhence $e'\\circ e=id_A$, i.e., $e$ is a section. Moreover\n$id_E\\circ e=e=e\\circ\nid_A=e\\circ(e'\\circ e)=(e\\circ e')\\circ e$ and $e$ is an epimorphism,\nhence $id_E=e\\circ e'$, i.e., $e$ is a section. The morphism $e$ is a\nretraction and a section too, thus $e$ is an isomorphism.\n\n(iv)$\\Rightarrow$(v) Follows easily from the definition.\n\nThe implication retraction ${\\Rightarrow}$ regular epimorphism can be\ninterpreted in the category of topological spaces ${{\\mathbf{Top}}}$ as\nthe well-known fact that each retraction is a quotient map.\n\n\\[EKVEPODMPREIZOM\\] Let ${f:A\\toB}$ be a morphism. The following\nconditions are equivalent:\n\n1.  $f$ is an isomorphism\n\n2.  $f$ is an epimorphism and a section\n\n3.  $f$ is an epimorphism and an extremal monomorphism\n\n4.  $f$ is a monomorphism and a retraction\n\n5.  $f$ is a monomorphism and an extremal epimorphism.\n\nThanks to the duality principle, it suffices to prove the equivalence of\nthe first three conditions.\n\n\\(i) $\\Rightarrow$ (ii) follows directly from the definition and (ii)\n$\\Rightarrow$ (iii) is an easy consequence of the above proposition.\n(iii) $\\Rightarrow$ (i): $f=id_B\\circ f$ and $f$ an epimorphism and\nextremal monomorphism. This implies that $f$ is an isomorphism.",
