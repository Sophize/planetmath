  "definition": "Preliminary remarks.\n====================\n\nLet $A$ be a set. The *power set* $P(A)$ is the set of all subsets of\n$A$; as such, this idea belongs to the realm of set theory. However,\nproperly formulated, the power set notion can be extended to categories\nmore general than ${\\mathit{Set}}$.\n\nEvery subset $S\\subset A$ determines, and is in turn determined by the\n$\\chi_S:A \\to \\{0,\\,1\\}$ defined by $$\\chi_S(a)=\n\\begin{cases}\n  1 & a\\in S,\\\\\n  0 & a\\notin S;\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad a\\in A.$$ In other words, elements of the power set $P(A)$\ncorrespond in a one-to-one fashion to maps from $A$ to $\\{0,1\\}$.\nSuppose now that $A$ is an object in a category ${{\\mathcal{C}}}$; this\nwill be specified as $ A \\in Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$, with\n$Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ being the class of objects of category\n${{\\mathcal{C}}}$.\n\nIt is tempting to generalize the power set construction by considering\ngeneral homomorphisms into some special object\n$\\Omega \\in Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ that can somehow serve as a\ncategory-theoretical analogue of the two element set. This, however,\nwill give us $P(A)$ as a Hom-set, whereas we want $P(A)$ to be another\nobject of ${{\\mathcal{C}}}$. What to do?\n\nA guiding insight[@BW] is to regard morphisms with codomain $A$ as\n\u201cgeneralized elements\u201d (gelements) of $A$. Let\u2019s return, for the moment,\nto the category of sets. Henceforth we use ${\\mathrm{Map}}(X,Y)$ to\ndenote the set of maps from $X$ to $Y$, and use the symbol $2$ to denote\nthe two element set $\\{0,1\\}$. Recall that the set\n${\\mathrm{Map}}(A,{\\mathrm{Map}}(X,Y))$ is naturally isomorphic to the\nset ${\\mathrm{Map}}(A\\times\nX,Y)$. In other words, the gelements of ${\\mathrm{Map}}(X,Y)$ are those\nspecial gelements of $Y$ whose domains are products $A\\times X$. It\nfollows that a gelement of $P(A)$, which is to say a map from $X$ to\n${\\mathrm{Map}}(A,2)$, is naturally the same thing as a map from\n$X\\times A$ to $2$. The latter corresponds to a subset of $X\\times A$.\nWe thereby arrive at the key insight:\n\n> Subsets of $X\\times A$ are naturally isomorphic to maps from $X$ to\n> $P(A)$.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is details.\n\nDefinition of power object.\n===========================\n\nLet ${{\\mathcal{C}}}$ be a category with finite limits (products and\npullbacks exist). For a morphism $m$ of the category, let $[m]$ denote\nthe equivalence class consisting of all morphisms $mf$ with $f$ an\nisomorphism. Recall that a subobject of an object\n$X \\in Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ is an equivalence class $[m]$ where $m$ is a\nmonomorphism.\n\nLet ${\\mathrm{Sub}}(-)$ denote the contravariant functor from\n${{\\mathcal{C}}}$ to ${\\mathit{Set}}$ that sends an object\n$X\\in Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ to ${\\mathrm{Sub}}(X)$, the set of all\nsubobjects of $X$. For a morphism $f:X\\to Y$ we define\n${\\mathrm{Sub}}(f):\n{\\mathrm{Sub}}(Y)\\to {\\mathrm{Sub}}(X)$ to be the set map that acts by\nsending a monomorphism $m:S\\to Y$ along $f$ to a monomorphism\n${\\hat{m}}:S\\times_f X\\to X$ obtained as the pullback of $m$ along $f$\n(see the figure below). Note: monomorphisms are pullback stable.\n\n![functoriality of\n${\\mathrm{Sub}}$[]{data-label=\"fig:1\"}](powerobject-fig1){width=\"4cm\"}\n\nNext, let us fix an object $A\\in Ob {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ and define what it\nmeans to be a power object of $A$. Let $F_A= {\\mathrm{Sub}}(-\\times A)$\nbe the functor from ${{\\mathcal{C}}}$ to ${\\mathit{Set}}$ that sends\n$X\\in {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ to ${\\mathrm{Sub}}(X\\times A)$. To establish the\nfunctoriality of $F_A$ we note that it is the composition of the functor\n$-\\times A: {{\\mathcal{C}}}\\to {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ and the functor\n${\\mathrm{Sub}}:{{\\mathcal{C}}}\\to {\\mathit{Set}}$. We say that an\nobject $B\\in {{\\mathcal{C}}}$ is a power object of $A$ if $B$ represents\nthe functor $F_A$. If such a $B$ exists, then by the Yoneda lemma, it is\nunique up to isomorphism. In other words, $B$ is a power object of $A$\nif there every monomorphism $m:S\\to X\\times A$ corresponds in a natural\nfashion to a morphism\n${\\hat{m}}\\in {\\mathrm{Hom}}_{{\\mathcal{C}}}(X,B)$, with equivalent\nmonomorphisms corresponding to the same ${\\hat{m}}$.\n\n**Note** that categories ${{\\mathcal{C}}}_L$ that have finite limits and\nare endowed *with the power objects* defined above satisfy the two\naxioms of topoi and are therefore called *topoi* (or toposes).\n\n[99]{} Michael Barr and Charles Wells, \u201cToposes, Triples, and Theories\u201d,",
