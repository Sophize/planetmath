  "definition": "A small $2$-category, $\\mathcal{C}_2$, is the first of\n[*higher-order*]{} n-categories constructed as follows.\n\n1.  Define $\\mathcal{C}at$ as the category of small categories and\n    functors\n\n2.  Define a class of objects $A, B,...$ in $\\mathcal{C}at$ called \u2018$0$-\n    *cells*\u2019\n\n3.  For all \u2018$0$-cells\u2019 $A$, $B$, consider a set denoted as\n    \u201c$\\mathcal{C}_2 (A,B)$\u201d that is defined as , with the elements of\n    the latter set being the functors between the $0$-cells $A$ and $B$;\n    the latter is then organized as a small category whose , or\n    \u2018$1$-cells\u2019 are defined by the natural transformations\n    $\\eta: F \\to G$ for any two morphisms of $\\mathcal{C}at$, (with $F$\n    and $G$ being functors between the \u2018$0$-cells\u2019 $A$ and $B$, that is,\n    $F,G: A \\to  B$); as the \u2018$2$-cells\u2019 can be considered as\n    \u2018$2$-morphisms\u2019 between $1$-morphisms, they are also written as:\n    $\\eta : F \\Rightarrow  G$, and are depicted as labelled faces in the\n    plane determined by their domains and codomains\n\n4.  The $2$-categorical composition of $2$-morphisms is denoted as\n    \u201c$\\bullet$\u201d and is called the *vertical composition*\n\n5.  A *horizontal composition*, \u201c$\\circ$\u201d, is also defined for all\n    triples of $0$-cells, $A$, $B$ and $C$ in $\\mathcal{C}at$ as the\n    functor\n    $$\\circ: \\mathcal{C}_2(B,C) \\times \\mathcal{C}_2(A,B) = \\mathcal{C}_2(A,C),$$\n    which is *associative*\n\n6.  The identities under horizontal composition are the identities of\n    the $2$-cells of $1_X$ for any $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}at$\n\n7.  For any object $A$ in $\\mathcal{C}at$ there is a functor from the\n    one-object/one-arrow category $\\textbf{1}$ (terminal object) to\n    $\\mathcal{C}_2(A,A)$.\n\nExamples of 2-categories\n------------------------\n\n1.  The $2$-category $\\mathcal{C}at$ of small categories, functors, and\n    natural transformations;\n\n2.  The $2$-category $\\mathcal{C}at(\\mathcal{E})$ of *internal\n    categories in any category $\\mathcal{E}$ with finite limits*,\n    together with the internal functors and the internal natural\n    transformations between such internal functors;\n\n3.  When $\\mathcal{E} = \\mathcal{S}et$, this yields again the category\n    $\\mathcal{C}at$, but if $\\mathcal{E} = \\mathcal{C}at$, then one\n    obtains the 2-category of small *double categories*;\n\n4.  When $\\mathcal{E} = \\textbf{Group}$, one obtains the *$2$-category\n    of crossed modules*.\n\nRemarks\n-------\n\n-   In a manner similar to the (alternative) definition of small\n    categories, one can describe $2$-categories in terms of $2$-arrows.\n    Thus, let us consider a set with two defined operations $\\otimes$,\n    $\\circ$, and also with units such that each operation endows the set\n    with the structure of a (strict) category. Moreover, one needs to\n    assume that all $\\otimes$-units are also $\\circ$-units, and that an\n    associativity relation holds for the two products:\n    $$(S \\otimes T ) \\circ (S \\otimes T) = (S \\circ S) \\otimes (T \\circ T);$$\n\n-   A $2$-category is an example of a supercategory with just two\n    composition laws, and it is therefore an $\\S_1$-supercategory,\n    because the $\\S_0$ supercategory is defined as a standard\n    \u2018$1$\u2019-category subject only to the ETAC axioms.",
