  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Two objects $A,B$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ are\nsaid to be *joined* if there is a morphism with domain one object and\ncodomain the other. In other words,\n$\\hom(A,B)\\cup \\hom(B,A)\\ne \\varnothing$. Two objects $A,B$ are said to\nbe *connected* if there is a finite sequence of objects in $\\mathcal{C}$\n$$A=C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n = B$$ such that $C_i,C_{i+1}$ are joined for\n$i=1,\\ldots,n-1$.\n\nA category is said to be *connected* if every pair of objects are\nconnected, and *strongly connected* if every pair of objects are joined.\n\nFor example, every category with either an initial object or a terminal\nobject is connected. If a category has a zero object, it is strongly\nconnected.\n\nA small category may be viewed as a graph or a digraph. Then the\nunderlying graph of a small connected category is connected, and the\nunderlying digraph of a small strongly connected category is strongly\nconnected. Conversely, the free category freely generated a connected\ngraph is connected, and the free category freely generated by a strongly\nconnected digraph is strongly connected.\n\nThe relation (on objects of $\\mathcal{C}$) of being joined is in general\nnot an equivalence relation (it is reflexive and symmetric, but not\ntransitive). Let us call this relation $R$. The relation of being\nconnected, on the other hand, is an equivalence relation, and is the\ntransitive closure $R^*$ of $R$. Therefore, we may partition the class\nof objects in $\\mathcal{C}$ by $R^*$. Furthermore, $R^*$ induces an\nequivalence relation $R'$ on the class of all morphisms in\n$\\mathcal{C}$: for morphisms $f,g$, set\n$$f R' g\\qquad\\mbox{iff}\\qquad \\operatorname{dom}(f) R^* \\operatorname{dom}(g).$$\nIf $A$ is an object of $\\mathcal{C}$, denote $[A]$ the equivalence class\ncontaining $A$ under $R^*$, together with the equivalence class\ncontaining $1_A$ under $R'$. Then $[A]$ is a connected full subcategory\nof $\\mathcal{C}$. $[A]$ is called a connected component of\n$\\mathcal{C}$. Every small category can be expressed as the disjoint\nunion of its connected components.\n\n[9]{} S. Mac Lane, [*Categories for the Working Mathematician*]{},\nSpringer, New York (1971).",
