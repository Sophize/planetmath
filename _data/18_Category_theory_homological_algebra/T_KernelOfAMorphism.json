  "definition": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category with zero object $O$. Given objects\n$A,B$, we can define a *zero morphism*, or *null morphism* to be the\nmorphism $o_{A,B}$ of the composition of the two unique morphisms\n$A\\to O$ and $O\\to B$ in $\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$:\n$$\\xymatrix@+=4pc{A\\ar[r]^{o_{A,B}}&B}=\\xymatrix@1{A\\ar[r]&O\\ar[r]&B}.$$\nThis morphism is unique with respect to $A$ and $B$, because $A\\to O$\nand $O\\to B$ are both unique, and any two zero objects are isomorphic.\nInstead of writing $o_{A,B}$, we may drop the subscript and write $o$ if\nthere is no confusion. It is easy to see that a composition of a\nmorphism with a zero morphism is a zero morphism.\n\nWith the zero morphism, we define the *kernel* of a morphism $f:A\\to B$\nto be the equalizer of $f$ and the corresponding zero morphism\n$o:A\\to B$. This means that, if $k:K\\to A$ is the kernel of $f$, then\n$f\\circ k=o$, and if $f\\circ g=o$ for some morphism $g$, there is a\nunique morphism $h$ such that $g=k\\circ h$. Diagrammatically, this means\nthat $$\\xymatrix@+=3pc{K\\ar[r]^k & A\\ar[r]^f &B}=0,$$ and if\n$$\\xymatrix@+=3pc{C\\ar[r]^g & A\\ar[r]^f &B}=0,$$ then there is a unique\n$h: C\\to K$ such that\n\n$\\xymatrix@R-=1pc{\nC\\ar[dr]^g\\ar[dd]_h\\\\\n&A\\\\\nK\\ar[ur]_k\n}$\n\nis a commutative diagram.\n\nBy the universality of equalizers, $(K,k)$ is unique up to isomorphism,\nif it exists. We usually call $K$ the kernel of $f$, and denote it by\n$\\ker(f)$, since $k$ is determined by $K$, up to isomorphism. A *kernel*\nis the kernel of some morphism. A kernel is always a monomorphism:\n\nSuppose $k:K\\to A$ is the kernel of $f:A\\to B$, and $g,h:D\\to K$ are\nmorphisms such that $r:=k\\circ g=k\\circ h:D\\to A$. Then\n$f\\circ r = f\\circ (k\\circ g)=(f\\circ k)\\circ h=0$, so that there is a\nunique morphism $s:D\\to K$ such that $k\\circ s=r$. But then\n$k\\circ s=k\\circ g=k\\circ h$ also. Since $s$ is unique, $g=h$.\n\nDually, we can define the cokernel of a morphism $g$,\n$\\operatorname{coker}(g)$, to be the coequalizer of $g$ and $o$. A\n*cokernel* is the cokernel of a morphism. A cokernel is always an\nepimorphism.\n\n**Remark**. A category with zero object is said to *have kernels* if\nevery morphism has a kernel. Dually, it is said to *have cokernels* if\nevery morphism has a cokernel.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n-   The category **Grp** of groups has the trivial group as the zero\n    object, and any trivial group homomorphism, mapping every element in\n    the domain to the identity in the range, as a zero morphism.\n\n-   The category **Grp** of groups has kernels. For any group\n    homomorphism $\\phi:G\\to H$, let $K=\\ker(\\phi)$, the kernel of $\\phi$\n    (in the sense of group theory), and $k:K\\to G$ be the canonical\n    injection. We shall see presently that $K$ is the kernel of $f$, in\n    the sense of category theory. First, $\\phi \\circ k (a) =\\phi(a)=e$\n    for every $a\\in K=\\ker(\\phi)$. Let $\\sigma:S\\to G$ be another group\n    homomorphism with $\\phi\\circ \\sigma = 1$, the trivial map from $S$\n    to $H$. Define $\\psi:S\\to K$ by $\\psi(s)=\\sigma(s)$, which is a\n    well-defined, because $\\phi(\\sigma(s))=e$, or\n    $\\sigma(s)\\in \\ker(\\phi)=K$. Furthermore,\n    $\\sigma(s) = \\psi(s) = k(\\psi(s))$. It is easy to see that $\\psi$ is\n    unique. Thus, $\\ker(\\phi)$ is the kernel of $\\phi:G\\to H$ in\n    $\\textbf{Grp}$.\n\n-   In addition, $\\textbf{Grp}$ has cokernels. Let $\\phi: G\\to H$ be as\n    above, and $C:=\\phi(G)^H$ the of $\\phi(G)$ in $H$. Form $Q=H/C$ and\n    let $p: H\\to Q$ be the canonical projection. For any $a\\in G$, we\n    have $p\\circ \\phi(a) = \\phi(a)C = C$, since\n    $\\phi(a)\\in \\phi(G)\\subseteq C$. Let $q: H\\to T$ be a group\n    homomorphism with $q\\circ \\phi = 1$. Define $\\mu: Q\\to T$ by\n    $\\mu(bC)=q(b)$. This is well-defined, for if $cC=bC$, then\n    $cb^{-1}\\in C$, which means that $cb^{-1}$ is a finite product of\n    elements of the form $d\\phi(a)d^{-1}$ where $a\\in G$ and $d\\in H$.\n    Since $q(d\\phi(a)d^{-1})=q(d)q(d^{-1})=e\\in T$, we have that\n    $q(c)q(b)^{-1}=e$. Again, $\\mu$ is easily seen to be unique. This\n    shows that $H/C$ is the cokernel of $\\phi:G\\to H$ in **Grp**.\n\n**Remark**. A category is said to be *Ab1*, a la Grothendieck, if it\nsatisifes the *Ab1 Axiom*: it has kernels and cokernels. From the\nexamples above, **Grp** is Ab1.",
