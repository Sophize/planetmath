  "definition": "A *locally finite category* is a category $\\mathcal{C}$ such that each\ncan be written as a composition of non-identity arrows in only finitely\nmany ways. To get a picture of what this means, view $\\mathcal{C}$ as a\ngraph, where the nodes are objects and the directed edges are all the\narrows besides the identity arrows. Note that loops besides identity\narrows are permitted. Then a decomposition of an arrow $f\\colon A\\to B$\nis a directed path from $A$ to $B$ in the graph. So the statement that\neach arrow can be decomposed in only finitely many ways essentially\nmeans that there are only finitely many directed paths from $A$ to $B$\nin the graph. This analogy only breaks down in the case where $A$ and\n$B$ are the same object.\n\nThe notion of a locally finite category generalizes the notion of a\nlocally finite poset. The condition that each interval $[x,z]$ in a\nposet $P$ contain only finitely many elements $y$ of $P$ implies that a\nlocally finite poset is locally finite when viewed as a category, since\nbetween two objects of $P$ there is at most one arrow.\n\nIf $\\mathcal{C}$ is a locally finite category, then an arises as the\ndual of a coalgebra over the category.\n\n[99]{} S.\u00a0A.\u00a0Joni and G.-C.\u00a0Rota, [*Coalgebras and bialgebras in\ncombinatorics*]{}, Stud.\u00a0Appl.\u00a0Math., 61 (1979), pp. 93\u2013139.",
