  "definition": "A *groupoid*, also known as a *virtual group*, is a small category where\nevery morphism is invertible. We can give a more explicit, algebraic\ndefinition: start with a set $G$, and a partial binary operation $\\circ$\non $G$. Call a pair $(x,y)$ of elements of $G$ a *composable pair* if\n$(x,y)\\in\\operatorname{dom}(\\circ)$. A *groupoid* is the pair\n$(G,\\circ)$, together with two unary operations $e_L$ and $e_R$ on it,\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n\n1.  $(x,y)$ is a composable pair iff $e_R(x)=e_L(y)$.\n\n2.  $(x,y)$ and $(x\\circ y, z)$ are composable pairs iff $(y,z)$ and\n    $(x,y\\circ z)$ are, and if one of these is true, then\n    $(x\\circ y)\\circ z=x\\circ (y\\circ z)$.\n\n3.  $(e_L(x),x)$ and $(x,e_R(x))$ are composable pairs and\n    $x=e_L(x)\\circ x=x\\circ e_R(x)$.\n\n4.  for each $x\\in G$, there exists $y\\in G$ such that $(x,y)$ and\n    $(y,x)$ are composable pairs, and $e_L(x)=x\\circ y$ and\n    $e_R(x)=y\\circ x$.\n\nBelow are some properties:\n\n1.  In condition 4 above, $e_L(x)=e_R(y)$ and $e_R(x)=e_L(y)$. This is\n    true by condition 1, since both $(x,y)$ and $(y,x)$ are composable\n    pairs.\n\n2.  Again, in condition 4, $y$ is unique. To see this, suppose $z\\in G$\n    satisfies condition 4 (in place of $y$). Then\n    $y= y\\circ e_R(y)= y\\circ e_L(x) = y\\circ (x\\circ y)=y\\circ (x\\circ z)=(y\\circ x)\\circ z= (z\\circ x)\\circ z=e_R(x)\\circ z = e_L(z)\\circ z = z$.\n    Notice property 1 is used in the proof. We call $y$ the *inverse* of\n    $x$, and write $x^{-1}$.\n\n3.  In view of condition 4, both $e_L$ and $e_R$ are unique. In other\n    words, if $f_L,f_R:G\\to G$ are unary operators on $G$ satisfying\n    conditions 3 and 4 above (in place of $e_L$ and $e_R$), then\n    $f_L=e_L$ and $f_R=e_R$. In fact, $e_L(x)=x\\circ x^{-1}$ and\n    $e_R(x)=x^{-1}\\circ x$.\n\n4.  Since\n    $x=e_L(x)\\circ x=e_L(x)\\circ (e_L(x)\\circ x)=(e_L(x)\\circ e_L(x))\\circ x$,\n    we see that $e_L(x)$ is composable with itself, and that\n    $e_L(x)\\circ e_L(x)=e_L(x)$ by the previous property. Similarly,\n    $e_R(x)\\circ e_R(x)=e_R(x)$. This shows that $e_R(x)$ and $e_L(x)$\n    are idempotent with respect to $\\circ$ for every $x\\in G$.\n\n5.  Since $(e_L(x),x)$ is a composable pair, $e_R(e_L(x))=e_L(x)$ for\n    any $x\\in G$. Similarly, $e_L(e_R(x))=e_R(x)$. Hence\n    $e_R(e_R(x))= e_R(e_L(e_R(x)))=e_L(e_R(x))=e_R(x)$. Similarly,\n    $e_L(e_L(x))=e_L(x)$. This shows that $e_R$ and $e_L$ are idempotent\n    with respect to functional compositions.\n\n6.  (Cancellation property): if $x\\circ y= x\\circ z$, then $y=z$; if\n    $y\\circ x=z\\circ x$, then $y=z$.\n\n    Since $(x,y)$ is a composable pair, $e_R(x)=e_L(y)$. But\n    $e_R(e_R(x))=e_R(x)$, we have $e_R(e_R(x))=e_L(y)$ so that\n    $(e_R(x),y)=(x^{-1}\\circ x,y)$ is a composable pair, hence\n    $(x^{-1},x\\circ y)$ is a composable pair and\n    $x^{-1}\\circ (x\\circ y)=(x^{-1}\\circ x)\\circ y=e_R(x)\\circ y$. Since\n    $(e_R(x),y)$ is a composable pair, $e_R(x)=e_R(e_R(x))=e_L(y)$. As a\n    result, $x^{-1}\\circ (x\\circ y)=e_L(y)\\circ y =y$. Similarly\n    $x^{-1}\\circ (x\\circ z)=z$. By assumption, we deduce that $y=z$. The\n    other statement is proved similarly.\n\n7.  The algebraic definition given can be easily turned into a\n    categorical definition (using objects and morphisms). The details\n    are left for the reader.\n\nIf $e_R$ and $e_L$ are constant functions, then $G$ is a group.\n\n**Remark**. There is also a with the same name.",
