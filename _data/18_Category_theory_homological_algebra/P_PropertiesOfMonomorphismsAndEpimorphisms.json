  "statement": "This entry deals with basic properties of monomorphisms and related\nnotions (as extremal and regular monomorphisms, retractions etc) as well\nas the dual notions.\n\nMonomorphisms (epimorphisms, bimorphisms) are closed under composition.\n\nIf ${f:A\\toB}$, ${g:B\\toC}$ are monomorphisms (epimorphisms,\nbimorphisms) then $g\\circ f$ is a monomorphism (epimorphism,\nbimorphism).\n\na\\) $g\\circ f\\circ h=g\\circ f\\circ k$ $\\Rightarrow$ $f\\circ h=f\\circ k$\n$\\Rightarrow$ $h=k$\\\nb) $h\\circ g\\circ f=k\\circ g\\circ f$ $\\Rightarrow$ $h\\circ g=k\\circ g$\n$\\Rightarrow$ $h=k$\\\nc) An easy corollary of a) and b).\n\nLet $f\\circ g$ be a monomorphism. Then $g$ is a monomorphism.\n\nclaim: If $g\\circ f$ is an epimorphism, then $g$ is an epimorphism.\n\n$g\\circ h=g\\circ k$ $\\Rightarrow$ $f\\circ g\\circ h=f\\circ g\\circ k$\n$\\Rightarrow$ $h=k$\n\nRetractions and sections are closed under composition.\n\nIf ${f:A\\toB}$, ${g:B\\toC}$ are retractions (sections, isomorphisms),\nthen $g\\circ f$ is a retraction (section, isomorphism).\n\nSuppose we are given ${h:B\\toA}$, ${k:C\\toB}$ such that $f\\circ h=id_B$,\n$g\\circ k=id_C$. Then\n$(g\\circ f)\\circ(h\\circ k)=g\\circ(f\\circ h)\\circ k=g\\circ id_B\\circ k=g\\circ k=id_C$.\nThus we have shown the first part of the claim. The second part is dual\nto the first one and the third one follows from the first two.\n\nLet ${f:A\\toB}$, ${g:B\\toC}$ be morphisms. If $g\\circ f$ is a section\nthen $f$ is a section. If $g\\circ f$ is a retraction then $g$ is a\nretraction.\n\nIf $g\\circ f$ is a section then there exists a morphism $h$ such that\n$h\\circ(g\\circ\nf)=(h\\circ g)\\circ f=id_A$, thus $f$ is a section as well.\n\nEvery section is a monomorphism. Every retraction is an epimorphism.\n\nLet ${f:A\\toB}$ be a section and ${g:B\\toA}$ be the left inverse to $f$,\ni.e., ${g:B\\toA}$, $g\\circ f=id_A$. If $f\\circ h=f\\circ k$ then\n$h=id_A\\circ h=g\\circ f\\circ h=g\\circ f\\circ\nk=id_A\\circ k=k$. The duality principle yields the second part of the\nclaim.\n\nRecall that a morphism is called an isomorphism if it is a section and a\nretraction at the same time.\n\nIf ${f:A\\toB}$, ${g,h:B\\toA}$ are morphisms such that $g\\circ f=id_A$\nand $f\\circ h=id_B$ then $g=h$.\n\n$h=id_A\\circ h=(g\\circ f)\\circ h=g\\circ(f\\circ h)=g\\circ id_B=g$\n\nA morphism ${f:A\\toB}$ is an isomorphism if and only if there exists a\nmorphism ${g:B\\toA}$ such that $g\\circ f=id_A$, $f\\circ g=id_B$. The\nmorphism $g$ is determined uniquely.\n\nThe implication $\\boxed{\\Leftarrow}$ is obvious. The implication\n$\\boxed{\\Rightarrow}$ follows from the above lemma.\n\nThe morphism $g$ from the above proposition is called the inverse of $f$\nand denoted by $f^{-1}$.\n\nAs an easy corollary we get:\n\nIf $f$ is an isomorphism then also ${f^{-1}}$ is an isomorphism.",
