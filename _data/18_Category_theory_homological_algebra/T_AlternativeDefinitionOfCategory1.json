  "definition": "The notion of category may be defined in a form which only involves\nmorphisms and does not mention objects. This definition shows that\ncategories are a generalization of semigroups in which the closure axiom\nhas been weakened; rather than requiring that the product of two\narbitrary elements of the system be defined as an element of the system,\nwe only require the product to be defined in certain cases.\n\nWe define a *category* to be a set[^1] $M$ (whose elements we shall term\n*morphisms*) and a function $\\circ$ (which we shall term *composition*)\nfrom a subset $D$ of $M \\times M$ to $M$ which satisfies the following\nproperties:\n\n-   [**1.**]{} If $a,b,c,d$ are elements of $M$ such that $(a,c) \\in D$\n    and $(a,d) \\in D$ and $(b,c) \\in D$, then $(b,d) \\in D$.\n\n-   [**2**]{} If $a,b,c$ are elements of $M$ such that $(a,b) \\in D$ and\n    $(b,c) \\in D$, then $(a \\circ b, c) \\in D$ and\n    $(a, b \\circ c) \\in D$ and\n    $(a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)$\n\n-   [**3a**]{} For every $a \\in M$, there exists an element $e \\in M$\n    such that\n\n    1.  $(e,e) \\in D$ and $e \\circ e = e$\n\n    2.  $(a,e) \\in D$ and $a \\circ e = a$\n\n    3.  For all $x \\in M$ such that $(x,e) \\in D$, we have\n        $x \\circ e = x$.\n\n-   [**3a**]{} For every $a \\in M$, there exists an element $e \\in M$\n    such that\n\n    1.  $(e,e) \\in D$ and $e \\circ e = e$\n\n    2.  $(e,a) \\in D$ and $e \\circ a = a$\n\n    3.  For all $x \\in M$ such that $(x,e) \\in D$, we have\n        $e \\circ a = x$.\n\nThis definition may also be stated in terms of predicate calculus.\nDefining the three place predicate $P$ by $P(a,b,c)$ if and only if\n$(a,b) \\in D$ and $a \\circ b = c$, our axioms look as follows:\n\n-   [**0.**]{} $(\\forall a,b,c,d) ~ P(a,b,c) \\land P(a,b,d) \\Rightarrow\n      c = d$.\n\n-   [**1.**]{} $(\\forall a,b,c,d) ~ ((\\exists e)~P(a,c,e)) \\land \n      ((\\exists e)~P(a,d,e)) \\land\n      ((\\exists e)~P(b,c,e))z \\Rightarrow ((\\exists e)~P(b,d,e))$\n\n-   [**2.**]{} $(\\forall a,b,c,d,e) ~ P(a,b,d) \\land P(b,c,e)\n      \\Rightarrow (\\exists f) ~ P(d,c,f) \\land P(a,e,f)$\n\n-   [**3a.**]{} $(\\forall a) (\\exists b) ~ P(b,b,b) \\land P(b,a,a)\n      \\land ((\\forall c,d) ~ P(b,c,d) \\Rightarrow c = d)$\n\n-   [**3b.**]{} $(\\forall a) (\\exists b) ~ P(b,b,b) \\land P(a,b,a)\n      \\land ((\\forall c,d) ~ P(c,b,d) \\Rightarrow c = d)$\n\nThat a category defined in the usual way satisfies these properties is\neasily enough established. Given two morphisms $f$ and $g$, the\ncomposition $f \\circ g$ is only defined if $f \\in {\\rm Hom} (B,C)$ and\n$g \\in {\\rm Hom} (A,B)$ for suitable objects $A,B,C$, i.e if the final\nobject of $f$ equals the initial object of $g$. The three hypotheses of\naxiom 1 state that the initial object of $a$ equals the final objects of\n$c$ and $d$ and that the initial object of $b$ also equals the final\nobject of $c$; hence the initial object of $b$ equals the final object\nof $d$ so we may compose $b$ with $d$. Axiom 2 states associativity of\ncomposition whilst axioms 3a and 3b follow from existence of identity\nelements.\n\nTo show that the new definition implies the old one is not so easy\nbecause we must first recover the objects of the category somehow. The\nobservation which makes this possible is that to each object $A$ we may\nassociate two sets: the set ${\\bf L}$ of morphisms which have $A$ as\ninitial object, ${\\bf L} = \\cup_{B \\in {\\rm Ob}} {\\rm Hom} (A,B)$, and\nthe set ${\\bf R}$ of morphisms which have $A$ as final object,\n${\\bf R} = \\cup_{B \\in {\\rm Ob}} {\\rm Hom} (B,A)$. Moreover, this pair\nof sets $({\\bf L},{\\bf R})$ determines $A$ uniquely. In order for this\nobservation to be useful for our purposes, we must somehow characterize\nthese pairs of sets without reference to objects, which may be done by\nthe further observation that, if we have two sets ${\\bf L}$ and\n${\\bf R}$ of morphisms such that $x \\in {\\bf L}$ if and only if\n$x \\circ y$ is defined for all $y \\in {\\bf R}$ and $x \\in {\\bf R}$ if\nand only if $y \\circ x$ is defined for all $y \\in {\\bf L}$, then there\nexists an object $A$ which gives rise to ${\\bf L}$ and ${\\bf R}$ as\nabove. This fact may be demonstrated easily enough from the usual\ndefinition of category. We will now reverse the procedure, using our\naxioms to show that such pairs behave as objects should, justifying\ndefining objects as such pairs.\n\nReturning to our new definition, let us now define\n$\\ell \\colon M \\to {\\cal P} (M)$, $r \\colon m \\to {\\cal P} (M)$,\n${\\cal L} \\subseteq {\\cal P} (M)$, and ${\\cal R} \\subseteq {\\cal P} (M)$\nas follows: $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\ell (a) &= \\{ b \\in M \\mid (b,a) \\in D \\} \\\\ \n r (a) &= \\{ b \\in M \\mid (a,b) \\in D \\} \\\\ \n {\\cal L} &= \\{ \\ell (a) \\mid a \\in M \\} \\\\\n {\\cal R} &= \\{ r (a) \\mid a \\in M \\}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe now show that, if $U,V \\in {\\cal L}$ then either\n$U \\cap V = \\emptyset$ or $U = V$. Suppose that $U,V \\in {\\cal L}$ and\n$U \\cap V \\neq \\emptyset$. Then there exists a morphism $a$ such that\n$a \\in U$ and $a \\in V$. By the definition of ${\\cal L}$, there exist\nmorphisms $b$ and $c$ such that $U = \\ell (b)$ and $V = \\ell (c)$. By\ndefinition of $\\ell$, we have $(a,b)\n\\in D$ and $(a,c) \\in D$. If $d \\in U$, then $(d,b) \\in D$ so, by axiom\n1, $(d,c) \\in D$, i.e. $d \\in \\ell (c) = V$. Likewise, switching the\nroles of $U$ and $V$ we conclude that, if $d \\in V$, then $d \\in U$.\nHence $U = V$.\n\nMaking an argument similar to that of last paragraph, but with $r$\ninstead of $\\ell$ and ${\\cal R}$ instead of ${\\cal L}$, we also conclude\nthat, if $U,V \\in {\\cal R}$ then either $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$ or\n$U = V$. Because of axiom 3a, we know that, for every $a \\in M$, there\nexists $b \\in M$ such that $a \\in \\ell (b)$ and, by axiom 3b, there\nexists $c \\in M$ such that $a \\in r (c)$. Hence, the sets ${\\cal L}$ and\n${\\cal R}$ are each partitions of $M$.\n\nNext, we show that, if $S \\in {\\cal L}$ and $a,b \\in S$, then\n$r(a) = r(b)$. By definition, there exists a morphism $c$ such that\n$S = \\ell (c)$, so $(a,c) \\in D$ and $(b,c) \\in D$. Now suppose that\n$d \\in r(a)$. This means that $(a,d) \\in D$. By axiom 1, we conclude\nthat $(b,d) \\in D$, so $d \\in\nr(b)$. Likewise, switching the roles of $a$ and $b$ in the foregoing\nargument, we conclude that, if $d \\in r(b)$, then $d \\in r(a)$. Thus,\n$r(a) = r(b)$.\n\nBy a similar argument to that of the last paragraph, we may also show\nthat, if $S \\in {\\cal R}$ and $a,b \\in S$, then $\\ell(a) = \\ell(b)$.\nTaken together, these results tell us that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between of ${\\cal L}$ and ${\\cal R}$ \u2014 to each\n$S \\in {\\cal L}$, there exists exactly one $T \\in {\\cal R}$ such that\n$S \\times T \\in D$ and vice-versa. In light of this fact, we shall\ndefine and object of our category to be a pair $(P,Q)$ of subsets of $M$\nsuch that $x \\in P$ if and only if $(x,y) \\in D$ for all $y \\in Q$ and\n$y \\in Q$ if and only if $(x,y) \\in D$ for all $x \\in Q$. Given two\nobjects $A = (P,Q)$ and $B = (R,S)$, we define\n${\\rm Hom} (A,B) = P \\cap S$. We now will verify that, with these\ndefinitions, our axioms reproduce the defining properties of the\nstandard definition of category.\n\nSuppose that $A = (P,Q)$ and $B = (R,S)$ and $C = (U,V)$ are objects\naccording to the above definition and that $f \\in {\\rm Hom} (A,B)$ and\n$g \\in {\\rm Hom} \n(B,C)$. Then $f \\in S$ and $g \\in R$. By the way we defined our pairs,\n$(g,f) \n\\in D$, so $g \\circ f$ is defined. Let $h$ be any element of $Q$. Since\n$f \\in P$, it follows that $(f,h) \\in D$. Since $(g,f) \\in D$ as well,\nit follows from axiom 2 that $(g \\cdot f, h) \\in D$, so\n$g \\circ f\\in P$. Let $k$ be any element of $U$. Since $g \\in V$, it\nfollows that $(k,g) \\in D$. Since $(g,f) \n\\in D$ as well, it follows from axiom 2 that $(k,g \\circ f) \\in D$, so\n$g \\circ f\n\\in V$. Hence, $g \\circ f \\in P \\cap V = {\\rm Hom} (A,C)$. Thus, $\\circ$\nis defined as a function from\n${\\rm Hom} (A,B) \\times {\\rm Hom} (B,C) \\to {\\rm Hom} (A,C)$.\n\nNext, suppose that $A = (P,Q)$ and $B = (R,S)$ are distinct objects. By\nthe properties described earlier, $P \\cap R = \\emptyset$ and\n$Q \\cap S = \\emptyset$. Let $E$ and $F$ be two objects. Since\n${\\rm Hom} (A,E) \\subset P$ and ${\\rm Hom} (B,F) \\subset R$, it follows\nthat ${\\rm Hom} (A,E) \\cap {\\rm Hom} (B,F)\n= \\emptyset$. Likewise, since ${\\rm Hom} (E,A) \\subset Q$ and\n${\\rm Hom} (F,B) \n\\subset S$, it follows that\n${\\rm Hom} (E.A) \\cap {\\rm Hom} (F,B) = \\emptyset$. Hence, it follows\nthat, given four objects $A,B,E,F$, we have\n${\\rm Hom} (A,E) \\cap {\\rm Hom} (B,F) = \\emptyset$ unless $A = B$ and\n$E = F$.\n\n\\[more to come\\]\n\n[^1]: For simplicity, we will only consider small categories here,\n    avoiding logical complications related to proper classes.",
