Then $f$ is said to be an *epimorphic\nextension* if it is both an epimorphism and a monorphism.\n\nFor instance, in the category of rings we say that a ring $B$ is an\nepimorphic extension of another ring $A$, if $A$ is a subring of $B$ and\nthe canonical homomorphism between $A$ and $B$ is an epimorphism.",
