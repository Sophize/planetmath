  "definition": "**Preliminary Data**.\\\nThere are several distinct definitions of *quantum topos* in the\nMathematical Physics literature attempting to redefine the quantum logic\nthat was first introduced by von Neumann and Birkhoff for the foundation\nof Quantum Mechanics. The definitions of quantum topoi published so far\nare not, however, those of \u2018quantum\u2019 categories (previously introduced\nas rigid monoidal categories) - with finite limits and power objects.\\\n\nA *quantum topos* was defined as a *general model, or representation of\nquantum state spaces (QST) in a topos* with a Heyting logic algebra as a\nsubobject *(quantum logic)* classifier.The differences between the\nseveral published definitions of a quantum topos differ in the\ncategorical representation in QST\u2019 s, and in the choice of category, but\nnot in the choice of quantum logic algebra that was selected as a\nstandard, Heyting logic algebra (or *Heyting algebra*) which has a\ncommutative *Heyting lattice* structure; this choice is at variance with\nthe original quantum logic introduced by von Neumann and Birkhoff. Thus\ninstead of the orthomodular lattice of Birkhoff and von Neumann, the\nrecent definitions of quantum topoi postulate an intuitionistic- Brouwer\nlogic corresponding to a pseudocomplemented and rel. pseudocomplemented\nlattice structure, as further explained in the next section.\n\nHeyting Logic Concept and Algebraic Structure\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA *Heyting lattice* $L$ is a Brouwer-intuitionistic logic lattice with a\nbottom, or lowest element $0$. In the more technical classification it\nis a lattice which is both \u2018pseudocomplemented and also relatively\npseudocomplemented\u2019. The concept of coincides with the material\nimplication operator, $\\Rightarrow$, in symbolic propositional logic\nbased on chryssippian or Boolean logic.\n\nA *Heyting algebra* is a *p-algebra (as defined next in **Definition\n1.3** ) with the relative pseudocomplentation operation* $\\to$ (which\nreplaces the propositional implication $\\Rightarrow$).\\\nGiven an element $a$ in a bounded lattice $L$, a *complement* of $a$ is\ndefined to be an element $b\\in L$, if such an element exists, such that\n$$a\\wedge b=0,\\qquad{ and }\\qquad a\\vee b =1.$$\\\nTo surmount the non-uniqueness of the complement, an alternative to the\nlatter was defined\u2013 the *pseudocomplement* of an element.\n\n> An element $b$ in a lattice $L$ with $0$ is a *pseudocomplement* of\n> $a\\in L$ if\n>\n> 1.  $b\\wedge a=0$\n>\n> 2.  for any $c$ such that $c\\wedge a=0$ then $c\\le b$.\n>\n> In other words, $b$ is the maximal element in the set\n> $\\lbrace c\\in L\\mid c\\wedge a=0\\rbrace$.\n\nA convenient modification of the pseudocomplemented (pc) lattice concept\nis a *p-algebra* (or pseudocomplemented algebra) which is a pc-lattice\nwhere $^*$ is regarded as an algebraic operator. Thus, a morphism of\npc\u2013lattices is a proper lattice homomorphism, whereas a morphism between\ntwo p-algebras is a lattice homomorphism $f$ that also preserves the\npc-algebraic operation $^*$, i.e., $f(a^*)= f(a)^*$. One can therefore\ndefine a *category of p-algebras* by specifying the morphism between any\npair of p-algebras (considered as objects of this algebraic logic\ncategory) as the $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$-lattice homomorphism, with the\nfollowing condition $f(1)=f(0^*)=f(0)^*=0^*=1$ being also satisfied.\n\n**Remark** Unlike the Heyting lattice, an $LM_n$-logic algebra has a\n*non-commutative* lattice structure and is therefore considered as a\nstronger candidate for quantum logics, including those based on the\northomodular lattices of the original quantum logic of Birkhoff and von\nNeumann. Thus, a generalized topos defined with a subobject classifier\nbased on $LM_n$-logic algebra may provide suitable representations of\narbitrary quantum state spaces.\n\n[9]{}\n\nButterfield, J. and C.
