  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nA *site* is a generalization of a topology, designed to address the\nproblem that in the algebraic category, the only reasonable topology is\nthe Zariski topology, in which the open sets are much too large. In\norder to obtain a well-behaved cohomology theory (and an algebraic\nversion of the fundamental group) one needs to find open sets that are\n\u201cfiner\u201d than the Zariski open sets.\n\nUsing the machinery of sites, one can construct \u00e9tale (or $l$-adic)\ncohomology, and one can construct crystalline cohomology, both of which\ncan be used to prove the Weil conjectures, and both of which serve as\ngeneralizations of the familiar cohomology from topology and complex\nanalysis.\n\nFix a universe $\\mathcal{U}$.\n\nA *site* is a $\\mathcal{U}$-category $\\mathcal{C}$ whose objects we call\n\u201copen sets\u201d and a set $S$ of collections of maps we call \u201ccoverings\u201d. A\ncovering of an object $U$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a set of morphisms\n${\\left\\{{p_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to U}\\right\\}}$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. These\nobjects must satisfy the following:\n\n1.  If $p:U'\\to U$ is an isomorphism, then\n    ${\\left\\{{U' \\overset{p}{\\to} U}\\right\\}}$ is a covering.\n\n2.  If $${\\left\\{{U_\\alpha \\overset{p_\\alpha}{\\to} U}\\right\\}}$$ is a\n    covering, and for all $\\alpha$\n    $${\\left\\{{U_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\overset{q_{\\alpha,\\beta}}{\\to} U_\\alpha}\\right\\}}$$\n    is also a covering, then\n    $${\\left\\{{U_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\overset{p_\\alpha \\circ\n    q_{\\alpha,\\beta}}{\\longrightarrow} U}\\right\\}}$$ is a covering.\n\n3.  If ${\\left\\{{U_\\alpha \\overset{p_\\alpha}{\\to} U}\\right\\}}$ is a\n    covering, and $V\\to U$ is a morphism, then the fibred products\n    $U_\\alpha \\times_U V$ exist for all $\\alpha$, and we can produce a\n    covering of $V$:\n    $${\\left\\{{V\\times_U U_\\alpha \\overset{q_\\alpha}{\\to} V}\\right\\}}$$\n    where $q_\\alpha$ is the projection onto the first factor of the\n    fibre product.\n\nGiven a site, it is very natural to construct presheaves and sheaves on\nit; the category of sheaves on a site is called a topos. This category\nis (under some technical assumptions) rich enough to allow a cohomology\ntheory.\n\nThe reference to universes and small sets in the definition may be\nsafely ignored for most purposes; they exist to deal with set-theoretic\ndifficulties one can encounter when dealing with certain sites (such as\nthe crystalline site or the big \u00e9tale site).\n\n[9]{}",
