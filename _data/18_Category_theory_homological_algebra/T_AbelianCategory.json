  "definition": "An *abelian category* is a category ${\\mathcal{A}}$ satisfying the\nfollowing axioms. Because the later axioms rely on terms whose\ndefinitions involve the earlier axioms, we will intersperse the\nstatements of the axioms with such auxiliary definitions as needed.\n\n**Axiom 1.** For any two objects $A,B$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$, the set of\nmorphisms ${\\operatorname{Hom}}(A,B)$ admits an abelian group structure,\nwith group operation denoted by $+$, satisfying the following naturality\nrequirement: given any diagram of morphisms $$\\xymatrix{\nA \\ar[r]^{f} & B \\ar@/_/[r]_{g_2} \\ar@/^/[r]^{g_1} & C \\ar[r]^h & D\n}$$ we have $(g_1+g_2) f = g_1 f + g_2 f$ and\n$h (g_1 + g_2) = h g_1 + h g_2$. That is, composition of morphisms must\ndistribute over addition in ${\\operatorname{Hom}}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$.\n\nThe identity element in the group ${\\operatorname{Hom}}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$\nwill be denoted by $0$.\n\n**Axiom 2.** ${\\mathcal{A}}$ has a zero object.\n\n**Axiom 3.** For any two objects $A,B$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$, the\ncategorical direct product $A \\times B$ exists in ${\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nGiven a morphism $f\\colon A \\to B$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$, a *kernel* of $f$\nis a morphism $i\\colon X \\to A$ such that:\n\n-   $fi = 0.$\n\n-   For any other morphism $j\\colon X' \\to A$ such that $fj = 0$, there\n    exists a unique morphism $j'\\colon X' \\to X$ such that the diagram\n    $$\\xymatrix{\n    & X' \\ar[d]^j \\ar@{-->}[dl]_{j'} \\\\\n    X \\ar[r]^i & A \\ar[r]^f & B\n    }$$ commutes.\n\nLikewise, a *cokernel* of $f$ is a morphism $p\\colon B \\to Y$ such that:\n\n-   $pf = 0.$\n\n-   For any other morphism $j\\colon B \\to Y'$ such that $jf = 0$, there\n    exists a unique morphism $j'\\colon Y \\to Y'$ such that the diagram\n    $$\\xymatrix{\n    A \\ar[r]^f & B \\ar[r]^p \\ar[d]_j & Y \\ar@{-->}[dl]^{j'} \\\\\n    & Y'\n    }$$ commutes.\n\n**Axiom 4.** Every morphism in ${\\mathcal{A}}$ has a kernel and a\ncokernel.\n\nThe kernel and cokernel of a morphism $f$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$ will be\ndenoted $\\ker(f)$ and ${\\operatorname{cok}}(f)$, respectively. (Some\ntexts use the notation $\\operatorname{coker}(f)$ for cokernel.) By the\nuniversal properties above, the kernel and cokernel of $f$ are only\nunique up to isomorphism, but by abuse of notation we write $\\ker(f)$\nfor a representative element of this isomorphism class.\n\nA morphism $f\\colon A \\to B$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is called a\n*monomorphism* if, for every morphism $g\\colon X \\to A$ such that\n$fg = 0$, we have $g=0$. Similarly, the morphism $f$ is called an\n*epimorphism* if, for every morphism $h\\colon B \\to Y$ such that\n$hf = 0$, we have $h=0$.\n\n**Axiom 5.** $\\ker({\\operatorname{cok}}(f)) = f$ for every monomorphism\n$f$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\n**Axiom 6.** ${\\operatorname{cok}}(\\ker(f)) = f$ for every epimorphism\n$f$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\n**Remark**. Equivalently, an abelian category is an additive category\nsuch that Axioms 4-6 are satisfied.",
