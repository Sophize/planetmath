  "definition": "### Motivation {#motivation .unnumbered}\n\nConsider a set $A$ and a subset $B\\subseteq A$. $B$ can be thought of as\na property of $A$: there is a function $\\chi_B:A\\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$,\nsuch that $\\chi_B(x)=1$ iff $x\\in B$. This function can be seen to be\nuniquely determined by the subset $B$, and conversely. If we denote\n$P(A)$ the set of all subsets of $A$ (the power set of $A$), and $2^A$\nthe set of all functions from $A$ to $2:=\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, then\n$P(A)\\cong 2^A$.\n\nIn fact, we have established a commutative diagram $$\\xymatrix@+=4pc{\nB \\ar[r]^{k}\\ar[d]_{inc}& \\lbrace 1\\rbrace \\ar[d]^i \\\\\nA \\ar[r]_{\\chi_B}& 2\n}$$ where $inc$ and $i$ are inclusion functions and $k$ is the unique\nconstant function. Any function $A\\to 2$ gives rise to a unique set $B$\nmaking the above diagram commute.\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nIn category theory, a *subobject classifier* is the generalization of\nthe above example, where $A$ is an object of a certain given category\n$\\mathcal{C}$ and $B$ is a subobject of $A$, $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ is\nreplaced by a terminal object, and $2$ is replaced by what is known as a\n*subobject classifier*, or a *truth object*. If we think of the category\n**Set**, $2$ \u201cclassifies\u201d elements of a given set as to whether they\nbelong to a certain subset or not, via a characteristic function. If the\nvalue of the function is $1$, then the element is in that subset,\notherwise it is not.\n\nFormally, let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category with a terminal object $1$. A\n*subobject classifier* is an object $\\Omega$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ such that,\nfor any monomorphism $f:B\\to A$, there exists a *unique* morphism\n$\\chi_B$ such that $$\\xymatrix@+=4pc{\nB \\ar[r] \\ar[d]_f & 1 \\ar[d]^{\\top}\\\\\nA \\ar@{.>}[r]^{\\chi_B} & \\Omega\n}$$ is a pullback diagram. $\\chi_B$ is called the *characteristic\nmorphism* of $f$ and $\\top$ is a *truth morphism*.\n\nIn a category with a terminal object 1, a subobject classifier may or\nmay not exist. If it does, it is unique up to isomorphism. Suppose $C$\nhas a terminal object $1$, has pullbacks, and has a subobject $\\Omega$.\nThen for any object $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, any morphism $f:X\\to \\Omega$\ngives rise to a unique monomorphism $g:A\\to X$ via the pull back of $f$\nand $\\top$: $$\\xymatrix@+=4pc{\nA \\ar[r] \\ar[d]_g & 1 \\ar[d]^{\\top}\\\\\nX \\ar[r]^f & \\Omega\n}$$ Since $\\Omega$ is a subobject classifier, $g$ determines $f$\nuniquely as well. So what we have is a one-to-one correspondence\n$${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(X)\\cong \\hom(X,\\Omega)$$ between the subobject\nfunctor and hom functor. It can be verified that the bijection is\nactually a natural isomorphism, so that ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}$ is a\nrepresentable functor. Conversely, it may be shown that if\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}$ is representable, then $C$ has a subobject\nclassifier.",
