Two elements $f\\colon A_1\\to B$ and\n$g\\colon A_2\\to B$ in $\\operatorname{Mono}(-,B)$ are if there exist two\nmorphisms $r:A_1\\rightarrow A_2$ and $s:A_2\\rightarrow A_1$ such that we\nhave the following two commutative diagrams:\n\n$\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\nA_1\\ar[dr]^f\\ar[dd]_r\\\\\n&B\\\\\nA_2\\ar[ur]_g\n}\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\n&&\\\\\n&and&\\\\\n&&\n}\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\nA_1\\ar[dr]^f\\\\\n&B\\\\\nA_2\\ar[ur]_g\\ar[uu]^s\n}\n$\n\nIt is easy to see that both $r$ and $s$ are monomorphic. In fact, $A_1$\nand $A_2$ are isomorphic objects, as $f=g\\circ r$ and $g=f\\circ s$, so\nthat $f=(f\\circ s)\\circ r$, or $1_{A_1}=s\\circ r$, since $s\\circ r$ is\nmonomorphic. Similarly $1_{A_2}=r\\circ s$. Monomorphism equivalence is\nan equivalence relation on $\\operatorname{Mono}(-,B)$.\n\n**Definition**. A *subobject* of an object $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ is an\nequivalence class in $\\operatorname{Mono}(-,X)$. Let\u2019s write\n$$[A\\to X]$$ for a subobject of $X$, and a monomorphism $f:A\\to X$ a\nrepresentative of $[A\\to X]$. If there is no danger of confusion, it is\noften easier to identify a subobject $[A\\to X]$ by $A$, and simply write\n$$A\\subseteq X,$$ as long as we keep in mind that, along with the object\n$A$, there is a monomorphism from $A$ to $X$. The class of subobjects of\n$X$ shall be denoted by\n$${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(X):=\\lbrace A\\mid A\\subseteq X\\rbrace.$$\n**Definition**. A category $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to be *well-powered* or\n*locally small* if for every object $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, the class\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(X)$ is a set. Most common categories are locally\nsmall.\n\nSuppose now that $\\mathcal{C}$ is well-powered and has pullbacks (a\npullback exists for every pair of morphisms into the same object). We\nshall turn ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}$ into a functor from $\\mathcal{C}$ to\n**Set**. For every morphism $\\alpha: X\\to Y$, define\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha)$ as follows:\n\n> take a representative $g\\in[B\\to Y]$, consider the pullback of\n> $\\alpha$ and $g$ indicated in the commutative diagram below:\n>\n> $\\xymatrix@C+=30pt@R+=40pt{\n> A\\ar[d]_f \\ar[r]^{\\beta} & B\\ar[d]^g \\\\\n> X\\ar[r]^{\\alpha} & Y.\n> }\n> $\n>\n> Since $g$ is monomorphism, so is $f:A\\to X$, and hence $A$ is a\n> subobject of $X$. We set ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha)([g]):=[f]$.\n\nBecause the diagram is a pullback, ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha)([g])$ gives\na unique value, and thus\n$${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha):{{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(Y)\\to{{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(X)$$\nis a well-defined morphism. Furthermore, it is easily verified that\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(1_X)=1_{{{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(X)}$ and\n${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha\\circ\\beta)= {{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\beta)\\circ{{\\mathrm{Sub}}}(\\alpha)$.\nThus, ${{\\mathrm{Sub}}}$ is a contravariant functor from $\\mathcal{C}$\nto $\\textbf{Set}$ (or a covariant functor\n$\\mathcal{C}^{op}\\to \\textbf{Set}$), and is called the *subobject\nfunctor* of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n### Equivalent Epimorphisms and Quotient Objects {#equivalent-epimorphisms-and-quotient-objects .unnumbered}\n\nDually, given an object $A$ in a category $\\mathcal{C}$, we can define\nan equivalence relation on $\\operatorname{Epi}(A,-)$, the class of all\nepimorphisms from $A$, by reversing all arrows in the previous\nparagraph. Specifically, two elements $f\\colon A \\to B_1$ and\n$g\\colon A \\to B_2$ in $\\operatorname{Epi}(A,-)$ are if there exist two\nmorphisms $B_1\\rightarrow B_2$ and $B_2\\rightarrow B_1$ such that the\nfollowing two diagrams commute:\n\n$\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\n&B_1\\ar[dd]\\\\\nA\\ar[ur]\\ar[dr]\\\\\n&B_2\n}\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\n&&\\\\\n&and&\\\\\n&&\n}\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\n&B_1\\\\\nA\\ar[ur]\\ar[dr]\\\\\n&B_2\\ar[uu]\n}\n$\n\n**Definition**. A *quotient object* of $X$ is an equivalence class in\n$\\operatorname{Epi}(X,-)$. A typical quotient object is denoted by\n$\\lbrack X\\to B \\rbrack$. If $\\mathcal{C}$ is a small category and has\npushouts, then there is a covariant functor\n${{\\mathrm{Quo}}}:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\textbf{Set}$ taking each object of\n$\\mathcal{C}$ to its set of quotient objects and each morphism between\ntwo objects to a morphism between the sets of their quotient objects.\n${{\\mathrm{Quo}}}$ is called the *quotient object functor* of\n$\\mathcal{C}$.",
