  "statement": "Every monomorphism in the category of sets is an injection.\n\nAssume $f \\colon A \\to B$ is a monomorphism. Then, by definition of\nmonomorphism, given any two maps $g,h \\colon C \\to A$, if\n$f \\circ g = f \\circ h$, then $g = h$. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are two\nelements of $A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. Let $C$ be a set with one\nelement, let $g$ be the map which sends this one element to $x$ and let\n$h$ be the map which sends this one element to $y$. Because\n$f(x) = f(y)$, we have $f \\circ g = f \\circ h$. Since $f$ is a\nmonomorphism, $g = h$, so $x = y$. This implies that $f$ is injective.\n\nEvery injection is a split monomorphism.\n\nAssume $f \\colon A \\to B$ is injection. If $A$ is empty, the result is\ntrivial, so we assume that $A$ is not empty; let $z$ be an element of\n$A$. Set $$g = \\{ (f(x),x) \\mid x \\in A \\} \\cup\n\\{(x,z) \\mid x \\in B \\land (\\forall y \\in A) x \\neq f(y)\\}$$ We claim\nthat $g$ is a function from $B$ into $A$. Suppose that $x$ is an element\nof $B$. If $x \\neq f(y)$ for any $y \\in A$, then we have exactly one\nelement of $g$ with $x$ as the first element, namely $(x,z)$. If $x = \nf(y)$ for some $y \\in A$, then we the pair $(x,y)$ with $x$ as first\nelement; were there another pair with $x$ as first element, then we\nwould have $(f(x_1),x_1) = (f(x_2),x_2)$ but, as $f$ is an injection,\n$f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ would imply $x_1 = x_2$, so this would not be a\ndistinct pair. Hence $g$ is a function. Furthermore, by construction\n$g \\circ f (x) = x$ for all $x \\in A$, so $f$ is a split monomorphism.\n\nNote that the second theorem is stronger than a simple converse to the\nfirst theorem \u2014 it states that an injection is not just a monomorphism,\nbut that it is actually a split monomorphism. In particular, this means\nthat, in the category of sets, all monomorphisms are actually split\nmonomorphisms.",
