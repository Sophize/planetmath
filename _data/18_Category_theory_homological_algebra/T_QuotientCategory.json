  "definition": "Quotient categories are a generalization of quotient structures found in\nmany mathematical systems, such as sets and groups. For example, if we\nhave a set $S= \\lbrace a,b,c \\rbrace$, by identifying $a$ and $c$ as\nbeing the \u201csame\u201d, we obtain a two-element set\n$\\lbrace \\lbrace a,c\\rbrace ,b\\rbrace$, called the quotient set of $A$\nby identifying $a$ and $b$. Here is a more useful example: take the set\n$S$ of integers. Identify integers $m$ and $n$ if their difference is\ndivisible by $2$. Then we obtain a quotient of $S$ consisting of two\nelements: the set of odd numbers and the set of even numbers.\n\nIn both of the examples above, we start with a set $S$ and a binary\nrelation $R$ (in the first example, $R$ is the singleton\n$\\lbrace (a,b)\\rbrace$, and in the second, $R$ consists of pairs of\nintegers $(m,m\\!+\\!2n)$, where $m,n$ are integers) on $S$. The quotient\n$Q$ of $S$ by $R$ then satisfies the following functional properties:\n\n1.  there is an onto map $p:S\\to Q$ such that $aRb$ implies $p(a)=p(b)$,\n    and\n\n2.  if we have another onto map $q:S\\to T$ satisfying 1 above, then\n    there is a unique map $f:Q\\to T$ such that $f\\circ p=q$.\n\nThe two properties above are exactly what we need to define the quotient\nof a category $\\mathcal{C}$ by a binary relation $R$ on $\\mathcal{C}$.\nBut what is $R$ precisely? We define a binary relation on a category\n$\\mathcal{C}$ to be a binary relation $R$ on\n$\\operatorname{Mor}(\\mathcal{C})$, the class of morphisms of\n$\\mathcal{C}$. In other words, $R$ is a class consisting of pairs\n$(f,g)$ where $f$ and $g$ are morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$. If $(f,g)$ is\nin $R$, we write $fRg$.\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $R$ a binary\nrelation on $\\mathcal{C}$. Then a *quotient* of $\\mathcal{C}$ by $R$ is\na pair $(\\mathcal{Q},P)$ where $\\mathcal{Q}$ is a category and\n$P:\\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{Q}$ is a functor, satisfying the following\ntwo conditions:\n\n1.  $P$ is a surjection on objects; that is, for every object $Q$ in\n    $\\mathcal{Q}$, there is a object $C$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, such that\n    $P(C)=Q$.\n\n2.  if $fRg$, then $P(f)=P(g)$,\n\n3.  if $(\\mathcal{D},F)$ is another pair satisfying conditions 1 and 2\n    above, then there is a unique functor $G:\\mathcal{Q}\\to \\mathcal{D}$\n    such that $G\\circ P = F$.\n\nIt is easy to see that $\\mathcal{Q}$ is unique up to natural\nisomorphism, if it exists. The category $\\mathcal{Q}$ is called the\n*quotient category* of $\\mathcal{C}$ by $R$, written $\\mathcal{C}/R$.\n\nTo see how $\\mathcal{C}/R$ may possibly be constructed, we make the\nfollowing few observations:\n\n-   First, if we take the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure\n    $R^*$ of $R$ (so that $R^*$ is the smallest equivalence relation\n    containing $R$), then $f R^* g$ implies $P(f)=P(g)$.\n\n-   In addition, if $f_1 R^* g_1$ and $f_2 R^* g_2$ such that\n    $f_1 \\circ f_2$ and $g_1\\circ g_2$ are both defined, then\n    $P(f_1\\circ f_2) = P(g_1\\circ g_2)$. This means that we may reduce\n    $R^*$ to a congruence relation $R'$ with respect to morphism\n    composition. Once again, $f R' g$ implies $P(f)=P(g)$.\n\n-   Furthermore, if $f:A\\to B$ and $g:C\\to D$ and $f R' g$, then\n    $P(f)=P(g)$ forces $P(A)=P(C)$ and $P(B)=P(D)$. In other words, the\n    domains of $f$ and $g$ are identified under $P$. The same is true\n    for the corresponding codomains. This implies that, if $[f]$ denotes\n    the equivalence class of $f$ under $R'$, then the domains\n    (codomains) of all $g\\in [f]$ are identified as one object in\n    $\\mathcal{C}/R$, if it exists.\n\n-   As a result, all the corresponding identity morphisms are identified\n    as well, for if $P(A)=P(B)$, then\n    $P(1_A)=1_{P(A)} = 1_{P(B)}= P(1_B)$. This means we can further\n    reduce $R'$ to $R''$ by such identifications. Note that $R''$ is\n    still a congruence relation.\n\nNote, however, the construction above does not guarantee that\n$\\mathcal{C}/R$ in fact exists. This is mainly due to the identification\nof objects in $\\mathcal{C}$, which may result in blowing up some hom\nsets into proper classes. However, if\n\n1.  $R$ is a set, or\n\n2.  if $f R g$ implies that $f$ and $g$ are parallel (they have the same\n    domain and codomain),\n\nthen $\\mathcal{C}/R$ exists. In the first case, every equivalence class\nwith respect to $R''$ is a set, so that hom sets remain sets. In the\nsecond, $R''$ is not even needed, so that no two objects are identified,\nand there is no danger in hom sets being blown up into classes. In fact,\nthe second condition is how [@Ma] defines a quotient category. Note that\nin this case, $P$ is a bijection on objects between $\\mathcal{C}$ and\n$\\mathcal{C}/R$.\n\nIn the following discussion, we denote objects and morphisms in\n$\\mathcal{C}/R$ by $[A]_R$ and $[f]_R$ (images of $A$ and $f$ under\n$P$), or simply $[A]$ and $[f]$ when there is no confusion.\n\nSuppose $\\mathcal{C}$ is a category with a binary relation $R$ on its\nmorphisms. Below are some examples, as well as a non-example:\n\n1.  Suppose $\\mathcal{C}$ is generated by four objects $A,B,C,D$ and\n    three morphisms $f:A\\to B$, $g:C\\to D$, and $h: B\\to C$.\n    Furthermore, suppose $R=\\lbrace (f,g)\\rbrace$. Then $\\mathcal{C}/R$\n    exists and is generated by objects $X=[A]=[C]$ and $Y=[B]=[D]$, and\n    morphisms $\\alpha=[f]:X\\to Y$ and $\\beta=[h]:Y\\to X$. Note that\n    whereas $\\mathcal{C}$ has only a finite number of morphisms ($f,g,h$\n    and four identities), the quotient $\\mathcal{C}/R$ has infinitely\n    many. For example, on $X$, the morphisms are $(\\beta\\alpha)^n$, for\n    any non-negative integer $n$.\n\n2.  If $R$ is defined so that $f R g$ iff $f$ is parallel to $g$, then\n    $R$ is easily seen to be a congruence relation. Then $\\mathcal{C}/R$\n    is the category whose objects are objects of $\\mathcal{C}$, such\n    that each hom set has at most one element. As a result, if both\n    $\\hom(A,B)$ and $\\hom(B,A)$ are non-empty, then $A$ is isomorphic to\n    $B$.\n\n3.  The two examples above are artificial, here\u2019s a concrete one: let\n    $\\mathcal{C}$ be the category of topological spaces and continuous\n    maps, define $R$ so that $f R g$ whenever $f$ is homotopic to $g$.\n    Then $\\mathcal{C}/R$ is the category of topological spaces with\n    homotopic classes of continuous maps.\n\n4.  Here\u2019s an example where $\\mathcal{C}/R$ does not exist. Let\n    $\\mathcal{C}$ be a category whose collection of objects is a proper\n    class, and there is a non-identity morphism $h_A$ on each object\n    $A$. Define $R$ so that $f R g$ iff there are objects $A,B$ with\n    $f=1_A$ and $g=1_B$. Then if $\\mathcal{C}/R$ were to exist, it would\n    have only one object, say $X$. Furthermore, $\\hom(X,X)$ contains a\n    morphism $[h_A]$ for every $A$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. Since $[h_A]=[h_B]$\n    iff $A=B$, $\\hom(X,X)$ is not a set. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}/R$ is\n    not well-defined.\n\n[99]{} S.\u00a0Mac\u00a0Lane. [*Categories for the Working Mathematician*]{}, 2nd\ned. Springer-Verlag, 1997",
