  "definition": "Let $q(t)$ be a twice differentiable function from ${\\mathbb{R}}$ to\n${\\mathbb{R}}$ and let $L$ be a twice differentiable function from\n${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ to ${\\mathbb{R}}$. Let $\\dot{q}$ denote\n${\\frac{{d}}{{d}{t}}}{q}$.\n\nDefine the functional $I$ as follows:\n$$I(q) = \\int_a^b L (t, q(t), \\dot{q}(t)) \\, dt$$ Suppose we regard the\nfunction $L$ and the limits of integratiuon $a$ and $b$ as fixed and\nallow $q$ to vary. Then we could ask for which functions $q$ (if any)\nthis integral attains an extremal (minimum or maximum) value. (Note:\nespecially in Physics literature, the function $L$ is known as the\n*Lagrangian*.)\n\nSuppose that a differentiable function $q_0\\!: [a,b] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$\nis an extremum of $I$. Then, for every differentiable function\n$f \\colon [-1,+1] \\times [a,b] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ such that\n$f(0,x) = q_0 (x)$, the function $g \\colon [-1, +1] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$,\ndefined as\n$$g (\\lambda) = \\int_a^b L \\left( t, f(\\lambda, t), {\\partial f \\over \\partial t} (\\lambda, t) \\right) \\, dt$$\nwill have an extremum at $\\lambda = 0$. If this function is\ndifferentiable, then $dg/d\\lambda = 0$ when $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nBy studying the condition $dg/d\\lambda = 0$ (see the addendum to this\nentry for details), one sees that, if a function $q$ is to be an\nextremum of the integral $I$, then $q$ must satisfy the following\nequation:\n$${\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {q}}} L - {\\frac{{d}}{{d}{t}}} \\left( {\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {\\dot{q}}}} L \\right) = 0.$$\nThis equation is known as the *Euler\u2013Lagrange differential equation* or\nthe Euler-Lagrange condition. A few comments on notation might be in .\nThe notations ${\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {q}}} L$ and\n${\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {\\dot{q}}}} L$ denote the partial derivatives\nof the function $L$ with respect to its second and third arguments,\nrespectively. The notation ${\\frac{{d}}{{d}{t}}}$ means that one is to\nfirst make the argument a function of $t$ by replacing the second\nargument with $q(t)$ and the third argument with $\\dot{q}(t)$ and\nsecondly, differentiate the resulting function with respect to $t$.\nUsing the chain rule, the Euler-Lagrange equation can be written as\nfollows:\n$${\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {q}}} L - {\\partial^2 \\over \\partial t \\partial \\dot{q}} L - \\dot{q} {\\partial^2 \\over \\partial q \\partial \\dot{q}} L - \\ddot{q} {\\partial^2 \\over  \\partial \\dot{q}^2} L = 0$$\n\nThis equation plays an important role in the calculus of variations. In\nusing this equation, it must be remembered that it is only a necessary\ncondition and, hence, given a solution of this equation, one cannot to\nthe conclusion that this solution is a local extremum of the functional\n$F$. More work is needed to determine whether the solution of the\nEuler-Lagrange equation is an extremum of the integral $I$ or not.\n\nIn the special case ${\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {t}}} L = 0$, the\nEuler-Lagrange equation can be replaced by the Beltrami identity.",
