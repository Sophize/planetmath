  "definition": "The simplest of the isoperimetric problems is the following:\n\n*One must set an arc with a given length $l$ from a given point $P$ of\nthe plane to another given point $Q$ such that the arc together with the\nline segment $PQ$ encloses the greatest area possible.*\n\nThis task is solved in the entry example of calculus of variations.\\\nMore generally, *isoperimetric problem* may determining such an arc $c$\nbetween the given points $P$ and $Q$ that it gives for the integral\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_P^Q\\!f(x,\\,y,\\,y')\\,ds\\end{aligned}$$ an extremum and that gives\nfor another integral $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_P^Q\\!g(x,\\,y,\\,y')\\,ds\\end{aligned}$$ a given value $l$, as both\nintegrals are taken along $c$. Here, $f$ and $g$ are given functions.\\\nThe constraint (2) can be omitted by using the function\n$f\\!-\\!\\lambda g$ instead of $f$ in (1) similarly as in the mentionned\nexample.",
