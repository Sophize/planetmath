Consider the\n    Banach space with $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Define the the function\n    $\\mu : \\mathfrak{B} \\longrightarrow L^p(X, \\mathfrak{B}, \\mu)$ by\n    $$\\mu(A) := \\chi_A$$ where $\\chi_A$ denotes the characteristic\n    function of the measurable set $A$. It is easily seen that $\\mu$ is\n    a vector measure, which is countably additive if $1 \\leq p < \\infty$\n    (in case $p = \\infty$, countably additiveness fails).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   spectral measures are vector measures in the $\\sigma$-algebra of\n    Borel sets in $\\mathbb{C}$ whose values are projections on some\n    Hilbert space. They are used in general formulations of the spectral\n    theorem.",
