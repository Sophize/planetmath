A standard example of a unitary space is ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ with inner\n    product $$\\label{eq:cprod}\n      \\langle u,v \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^n u_i\\, \\overline{v_i},\\quad\n      u,v \\in{\\mathbb{C}}^n.$$\n\n2.  Unitary transformations and unitary matrices are closely related. On\n    the one hand, a unitary matrix defines a unitary transformation of\n    ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ relative to the inner product . On the other hand,\n    the representing matrix of a unitary transformation relative to an\n    orthonormal basis is, in fact, a unitary matrix.\n\n3.  A unitary transformation is an automorphism. This follows from the\n    fact that a unitary transformation $T$ preserves the inner-product\n    norm: $$\\label{eq:def1}\n        \\Vert T u \\Vert= \\Vert u\\Vert,\\quad u\\in V.$$ Hence, if\n    $$Tu=0,$$ then by the definition it follows that\n    $$\\Vert u \\Vert = 0,$$ and hence by the inner-product axioms that\n    $$u=0.$$ Thus, the kernel of $T$ is trivial, and therefore it is an\n    automorphism.\n\n4.  Moreover, relation can be taken as the definition of a unitary\n    transformation. Indeed, using the polarization identity it is\n    possible to show that if $T$ preserves the norm, then must hold as\n    well.\n\n5.  A simple example of a unitary matrix is the change of coordinates\n    matrix between two orthonormal bases. Indeed, let $u_1,\\ldots, u_n$\n    and $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ be two orthonormal bases, and let $A=(A^i_j)$\n    be the corresponding change of basis matrix defined by\n    $$v_j = \\sum_i A^i_j\\, u_i,\\quad j=1,\\ldots, n.$$ Substituting the\n    above relation into the defining relations for an orthonormal basis,\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\langle u_i,u_j\\rangle &=& \\delta_{ij},\\\\\n    \\langle v_k,v_l\\rangle &=& \\delta_{kl},  \\end{aligned}$$ we obtain\n    $$\\sum_{ij} \\delta_{ij} A^i_k \\overline{A^j_l}  = \\sum_i A^i_k \\overline{A^i_l} =\n    \\delta_{kl}.$$ In matrix notation, the above is simply\n    $$A \\bar{A}^t = I,$$ as desired.\n\n6.  Unitary transformations form a group under composition. Indeed, if\n    $S, T$ are unitary transformations then $ST$ is also surjective and\n    $$\\langle STu, STv \\rangle = \\langle Tu, Tv\\rangle = \\langle u, v\\rangle$$\n    for every $u,v \\in V$. Hence $ST$ is also a unitary transformation.\n\n7.  Unitary spaces, transformations, matrices and operators are of\n    fundamental importance in quantum mechanics.",
