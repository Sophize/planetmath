  "definition": "### Baer Rings {#baer-rings .unnumbered}\n\nLet $R$ be a ring with multiplicative identity $1$. Then $R$ is called a\nleft *Baer ring* if, for any subset $S$ of $R$, the left annihilator of\n$S$ is left principal, generated by an idempotent:\n$$\\operatorname{l.ann}(S):=\\lbrace r\\in R\\mid rS=0\\rbrace=Re.$$\n\nA right Baer ring is defined similarly, by replacing the word left with\nright above. It turns out that a left Baer ring is a right Baer ring,\nand vice versa, so we may drop the word left or right in the name.\n\nClearly, a domain is a Baer ring. And, by Wedderburn-Artin theorem, a\nsemisimple ring is also a Baer ring. Another example, found in operator\ntheory, is the ring of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space.\n\nA closely related concept is that of a left (right) *Baer \\*-ring*: it\nis a ring with involution $*$ such that the left (right) annihilator of\nany subset is left (right) principal, generated by a projection (an\nidempotent that is in addition a self-adjoint element).\n\nA left Baer \\*-ring is a left Baer ring, a right Baer \\*-ring is a right\nBaer ring. And, interestingly, the notion of left and right is also\nredundent for Baer \\*-rings. For example, let\u2019s show left means right.\nSince a left Baer \\* ring $R$ is left, and consequently right Baer, the\nright annihilator of a subset $S$ has the form\n$\\operatorname{r.ann}(S)=eR$ for some idempotent $e\\in R$. Since $Se=0$,\n$e^*S^*=0$ or that $\\operatorname{l.ann}(S^*)=Re^*$. But $R$ is left\nBaer \\*, $\\operatorname{l.ann}(S^*)=Rf$ for some projection $f\\in R$. So\n$fR=f^*R^*=(Rf)^*=(Re^*)^*=e^{**}R^*=eR=\\operatorname{r.ann}(S)$.\n\n### Rickart Rings {#rickart-rings .unnumbered}\n\nA closely related type of rings is called a left *Rickart ring*. A ring\nis left Rickart if the left annihilator of any element $a\\in R$ is left\nprincipal, generated by an idempotent:\n$$l.ann(a):=\\lbrace r\\in R\\mid ra=0\\rbrace = Re$$ where $e=ee$. A right\nRickart ring is similarly defined. Clearly, a Baer ring is both right\nand left Rickart. However, the converse is not always true. In fact,\nright Rickart and left Rickart are not the same. An example of a left\nRickart ring that is not right Rickart can be found in the second\nreference below. It may be shown that if all idempotents are central\n(lying in the center) in a left Rickart ring $R$, then $R$ is also right\nRickart (and vice versa).\n\n[9]{} I.
