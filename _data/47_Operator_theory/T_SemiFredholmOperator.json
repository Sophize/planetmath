  "definition": "A **semi-Fredholm operator** is a bounded operator between Banach spaces\nthat has a finite dimensional kernel or cokernel, and closed range.\nThere are two semigroups of semi-Fredholm operators: upper semi-Fredholm\noperators (those which have finite dimensional kernels), and lower\nsemi-Fredholm operators (those which have finite dimensional cokernels).\nA semi-Fredholm operator that is both upper and lower is Fredholm. If an\noperator is homotopic through (a norm continuous path of) semi-Fredholm\noperators to a Fredholm operator, then it is Fredholm.",
