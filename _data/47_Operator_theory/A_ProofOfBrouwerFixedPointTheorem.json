  "argumentText": "Proof of the Brouwer fixed point theorem:\n\nAssume that there does exist a map from $f:B^n\\to B^n$ with no fixed\npoint. Then let $g(x)$ be the following map: Start at $f(x)$, draw the\nray going through $x$ and then let $g(x)$ be the first intersection of\nthat line with the sphere. This map is continuous and well defined only\nbecause $f$ fixes no point. Also, it is not hard to see that it must be\nthe identity on the boundary sphere. Thus we have a map\n$g:B^n\\to S^{n-1}$, which is the identity on $S^{n-1}=\\partial B^n$,\nthat is, a retraction. Now, if $i:S^{n-1}\\to B^n$ is the inclusion map,\n$g\\circ i=\\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}}$. Applying the reduced homology functor,\nwe find that $g_*\\circ i_*=\\mathrm{id}_{\\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})}$,\nwhere $_*$ indicates the induced map on homology.\n\nBut, it is a well-known fact that $\\tilde{H}_{n-1}(B^n)=0$ (since $B^n$\nis contractible), and that $\\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})=\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus\nwe have an isomorphism of a non-zero group onto itself factoring through\na trivial group, which is clearly impossible. Thus we have a\ncontradiction, and no such map $f$ exists.",
