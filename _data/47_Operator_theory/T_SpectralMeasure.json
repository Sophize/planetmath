Since from condition (d) the projections\n$P(E_1), P(E_2), \\ldots$ are orthogonal, we know that the pointwise\nlimit exists and is a projection (see , Theorem 5).\n\n$\\,$\n\n[ **:**]{} In the following $\\mathrm{Ran}(T)$ denotes the of an operator\n$T \\in B(H)$.\n\n-   $E_1 \\subseteq E_2\\; \\Longrightarrow \\; \\mathrm{Ran}(P(E_1)) \\subseteq \\mathrm{Ran}(P(E_2))$.\n\n-   $P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = P(E_1)P(E_2)\\;\\;$ for every\n    $E_1, E_2 \\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nThus, a spectral measure is a countably additive vector measure whose\nvalues are projections. For that, spectral measures are also called\n*projection valued measures*.\n\nExamples\n========\n\n-   Let $(X, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$ be a measure space. Consider the Hilbert\n    space . We regard a function $f$ in as the multiplication operator\n    $M_f \\in B(L^2(X,\\mu))$ given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n    M_f (\\xi) = f\\xi\\,, \\qquad\\qquad \\xi \\in L^2(X, \\mu)\\end{aligned}$$\n    In this setting, the characteristic functions are projections in\n    $B(L^2(X, \\mu))$ and we have a spectral measure given by\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    P:X & \\longrightarrow  B(L^2(X, \\mu)) \\\\\n    P(E) & :=  \\chi_E\\end{aligned}$$\n\n-   Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $T \\in B(H)$ a normal operator and\n    $\\sigma(T)$ the spectrum of $T$. For any measurable subset\n    $E \\subseteq \\sigma(T)$ the operators $\\chi_E (T)$, given by the\n    Borel functional calculus, are projections in $B(H)$. Moreover, we\n    have a spectral measure given by: $$\\begin{aligned}\n    P:X & \\longrightarrow  B(H) \\\\\n    P(E) & :=  \\chi_E(T)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nEquivalent Definition\n=====================\n\nThe following result provides a very useful equivalent definition of a\nspectral measure.\n\n[**Theorem 1 -**]{} *A function $P: \\mathcal{B} \\longrightarrow B(H)$\nwhose values are projections is a spectral measure in $X$ if and only if\n$P(X) = I$ and for every $\\xi, \\eta \\in H$ the function\n$\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}: X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ given by*\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}(E) := \\langle P(E)\\xi, \\eta \\rangle\\end{aligned}$$ *is a\ncomplex measure in $X$.*\n\nIntegration against spectral measures\n=====================================\n\nLet $f :X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ be a measurable function and $P$ a\nspectral measure in $X$. We are interested to give meaning to the\nintegral $$\\int_X f dP$$\n\nSince we are dealing with \u201cmeasures\u201d whose values are linear operators\nit is reasonable to expect that this integral is itself a linear\noperator.\n\nThere are two natural ways to define it that turn out to be equivalent.\nThe first approach is a construction that resembles the approximation of\n$f$ by simple functions in Lebesgue integral theory. Here the role of\nsimple functions will be played by the operators of the form\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_i \\lambda_i\\, P(E_i)\\,, \\qquad\\qquad \\lambda_i \\in \\mathbb{C}\\end{aligned}$$\n\n[**Theorem 2 -**]{} *There exists a unique operator $S \\in B(H)$ with\nthe following property: for any given $\\epsilon >0$ and for every\nmeasurable partition $\\{E_1, \\cdots, E_n\\}$ of $X$ that satisfies\n$|f(x)-f(x')| < \\epsilon$ for all $x, x' \\in E_i$, we have*\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\|S - \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) P(E_i)\\| < \\epsilon\\end{aligned}$$ *for any\nchoice of points $x_i \\in E_i$.*\n\n$\\,$\n\nWe can then define $\\displaystyle \\int_X f dP$ as the unique operator\n$S$ described by Theorem 2.\n\nThe other approach to define this integral is by specifying an\nappropriate bounded sesquilinear form. Recall that from , to every\nbounded sesquilinear form corresponds a unique bounded operator. The\nconstruction is as follows:\n\nFirst we notice that, from the alternative defintion of spectral measure\n(Theorem 1), for every vectors $\\xi, \\eta \\in H$ we can define a complex\nmeasure $\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}$ by\n$$\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}(E) = \\langle P(E)\\,\\xi, \\eta \\rangle,$$ whose total\nvariation is estimated by $\\|\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}\\| \\leq \\|\\xi\\| \\|\\eta\\|$.\n\nThen we notice that the function\n$[\\cdot,\\cdot] : H \\times H \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ defined by\n$$[\\xi, \\eta] :=\\int_X f\\; d\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}$$ is a sesquilinear form.\n\nThen, by the , there exists a unique operator $S \\in B(H)$ such that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle S \\xi, \\eta \\rangle = \\int_X f\\; d\\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}, \\quad\\quad \\xi, \\eta \\in H\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe can then define $\\displaystyle \\int_X f \\;dP$ as this operator $S$.\nOf course, the two definitions are equivalent. We summarize this in the\nfollowing result\n\n$\\,$\n\n[**Theorem 3 -**]{} *Given a spectral measure $P$ and a bounded Borel\nfunction $f$, an operator $S$ that satisfies condition (1) also\nsatisfies the conditions of Theorem 2. Therefore, both definitions of\nthe integral of $f$ with respect to $P$ coincide and we have that:*\n\n-   $\\displaystyle \\big\\langle \\int_X f\\; dP\\, \\xi, \\eta \\big\\rangle = \\int_X f \\;d \\mu_{\\xi, \\eta}$\n\n-   $\\displaystyle \\int_X f\\; dP$ *can be arbitrarilly approximated in\n    norm by operators of the form*\n    $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)P(E_i)$.\n\nRemarks\n=======\n\nThe second example we gave above, of a spectral measure associated with\na normal operator, is in some sense the general case: all spectral\nprojections in $\\mathbb{C}$ supported in a compact set arise from a\nnormal operator. Thus, to any such spectral projection we can associate\na normal operator and vice-versa. This interplay between spectral\nprojections and normal operators is deeply explored in some versions of\nthe spectral theorem.\n\n[9]{} W.
