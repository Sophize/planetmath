  "definition": "Given a topological space $X$, we say that a map $f\\colon Y\\to X$ is\n**densely defined** if its domain $Y$ is a dense subset of $X$.\n\nThis terminology is commonly used in the of linear operators with the\nfollowing meaning: In a normed space $X$, a linear operator\n$A\\colon\\mathscr{D}(A)\\subset X\\to X$ is said to be **densely defined**\nif $\\mathscr{D}(A)$ is a dense vector subspace of $X$.",
