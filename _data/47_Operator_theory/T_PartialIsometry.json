  "definition": "Partial isometry is a generalization of an isometry. Before defining\nwhat a partial isometry is, let\u2019s recall two familiar concepts in linear\nalgebra: an isometry and the adjoint of a linear map.\n\n1.  An isometry $T$ is a linear automorphism over an inner product space\n    $V$ which preserves the inner product of any two vectors:\n    $\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\langle Tx, Ty\\rangle$.\n\n2.  The adjoint $T^*$ of a linear transformation $T$ is linear\n    transformation such that\n    $\\langle Tx,y\\rangle = \\langle x, T^*y\\rangle$, for any pair of\n    vectors $x,y\\in V$.\n\nIf $V$ is non-singular with respect to the inner product\n$\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ and that the adjoint $T^*$ of a linear\ntransformation $T$ exists, it is not hard to show that\n\n> $T$ is an isometry if and only if $TT^*=I=T^*T$.\n\nIn other words, $T^*$ is the inverse of $T$.\n\nMore generally, in a ring with involution $*$, an isometry (or an\nunitary element) is a unit (both a left unit and a right unit) $a$ whose\nproduct with its adjoint $a^*$ is 1 (i.e. its inverse is its adjoint).\nNow, if $a$ is not a unit, this product $aa^*$ will not be 1. The next\nbest thing to hope for is that the product will be an idempotent. But\nbecause $aa^*$ is self-adjoint, this idempotent is in fact a projection.\nThis is how a partial isometry is defined. Formally,\n\n> let $R$ be a ring with involution $*$, an element $a\\in R$ is a\n> *partial isometry* if $aa^*$ and $a^*a$ are both projections.\n\nGiven a partial isometry $a$, the projections $a^*a$ and $aa^*$ are\nrespectively called the *initial projection* and *final projection* of\n$a$.\n\n**Examples**. Under this definition, $0$ is a partial isometry, and so\nis any isometry.\n\nThis definition can be readily applied to specific (more familiar)\nsituations. For example, if the ring in question is the ring of linear\nendomorphisms over a Euclidean space (real or complex), then a partial\nisometry is just a map such that its restriction to the complementary\nsubspace of its kernel is an isometry. If we look at the case when the\nspace is 3 dimensional over the reals, and taking the standard basis,\nthe matrix\n\n$A =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\\\\n0 & \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\ncorresponds to a partial isometry whose kernel is a line $L$. Its\nrestriction to the complement of $L$ corresponds to the matrix\n\n$B =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nwhich is an isometry (rotation).\n\n**Remark**. If the ring $R$ is a Baer \\*-ring, an element $a$ is a\npartial isometry iff $aa^*a=a$ (so $a^*aa^*=a^*$; $a$ and $a^*$ are\ngeneralized inverses of one another).",
