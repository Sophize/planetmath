  "definition": "The [*most significant digit*]{} of a number $n$ written in a given\npositional base $b$ is the digit in the most significant place value,\nand has to be in the range $-1 < d_k < b$. In the case of an integer,\nthe most significant digit is the $b^k$\u2019s place value, where $k$ is the\ntotal number of digits, or $k = \\lfloor log_{b} n \\rfloor$.\n\nIn an array of digits $k$ long meant for mathematical manipulation, it\nmight be convenient to index the least significant digit with index 1 or\n0, and the more significant digits with larger integers. (This enables\nthe calculation of the value of a given digit as $d_ib^i$ rather than\n$d_ib^{k - i}$.) For an array of digits meant for text string\nmanipulation, however, the most significant digit might be placed at\nposition 0 or 1 (for example, by Mathematica\u2019s IntegerDigits function).\n\nIn binary, the most significant digit is often called the [*most\nsignificant bit*]{}.",
