  "definition": "A [*primality certificate*]{} of an integer $n$ is a small set of\nnumbers which enable one to quickly verify the primality of $n$ by using\nthe numbers in a computation specified by a given theorem. Doing the\ncomputations to verify the certificate should be much faster than\nperforming any sort of primality test on the number.",
