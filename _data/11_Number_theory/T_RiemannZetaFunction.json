  "definition": "Definition\n==========\n\nThe *Riemann zeta function* is defined to be the complex valued function\ngiven by the series $$\\label{def}\n\\zeta(s) := \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s},$$ which is valid (in fact,\nabsolutely convergent) for all complex numbers $s$ with\n${\\operatorname{Re}}(s) > 1$. We list here some of the key\nproperties\u00a0[@ahlfors] of the zeta function.\n\n1.  For all $s$ with ${\\operatorname{Re}}(s) > 1$, the zeta function\n    satisfies the *Euler product formula* $$\\label{product}\n    \\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p} \\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}},$$ where the product is\n    taken over all positive integer primes $p$, and converges uniformly\n    in a neighborhood of $s$.\n\n2.  The zeta function has a meromorphic continuation to the entire\n    complex plane with a simple pole at $s=1$, of residue $1$, and no\n    other singularities.\n\n3.  The zeta function satisfies the *functional equation*\n    $$\\label{functional}\n    \\zeta(s) = 2^s \\pi^{s-1} \\sin \\frac{\\pi s}{2} \\Gamma(1-s) \\zeta(1-s),$$\n    for any $s \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$ (where $\\Gamma$ denotes the Gamma\n    function).\n\nDistribution of primes\n======================\n\nThe Euler product formula\u00a0 given above expresses the zeta function as a\nproduct over the primes $p \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}$, and consequently provides\na link between the analytic properties of the zeta function and the\ndistribution of primes in the integers. As the simplest possible\nillustration of this link, we show how the properties of the zeta\nfunction given above can be used to prove that there are infinitely many\nprimes.\n\nIf the set $S$ of primes in ${\\mathbb{Z}}$ were finite, then the Euler\nproduct formula $$\\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p \\in S} \\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}$$\nwould be a finite product, and consequently $\\lim_{s \\to 1} \\zeta(s)$\nwould exist and would equal\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 1} \\zeta(s) = \\prod_{p \\in S} \\frac{1}{1 - p^{-1}}.$$ But\nthe existence of this limit contradicts the fact that $\\zeta(s)$ has a\npole at $s=1$, so the set $S$ of primes cannot be finite.\n\nA more sophisticated analysis of the zeta function along these lines can\nbe used to prove both the analytic prime number theorem and Dirichlet\u2019s\ntheorem on primes in arithmetic progressions[^1]. Proofs of the prime\nnumber theorem can be found in\u00a0[@bak-newman] and\u00a0[@patterson], and for\nproofs of Dirichlet\u2019s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions the\nreader may look in\u00a0[@janusz] and\u00a0[@serre].\n\nZeros of the zeta function\n==========================\n\nA *nontrivial zero* of the Riemann zeta function is defined to be a root\n$\\zeta(s) = 0$ of the zeta function with the property that $0\n\\leq {\\operatorname{Re}}(s) \\leq 1$. Any other zero is called *trivial\nzero* of the zeta function.\n\nThe reason behind the terminology is as follows. For complex numbers $s$\nwith real part greater than 1, the series definition\u00a0 immediately shows\nthat no zeros of the zeta function exist in this region. It is then an\neasy matter to use the functional equation\u00a0 to find all zeros of the\nzeta function with real part less than 0 (it turns out they are exactly\nthe values $-2n$, for $n$ a positive integer). However, for values of\n$s$ with real part between 0 and 1, the situation is quite different,\nsince we have neither a series definition nor a functional equation to\nfall back upon; and indeed to this day very little is known about the\nbehavior of the zeta function inside this critical strip of the complex\nplane.\n\nIt is known that the prime number theorem is equivalent to the assertion\nthat the zeta function has no zeros $s$ with\n${\\operatorname{Re}}(s) = 0$ or ${\\operatorname{Re}}(s) = 1$. The\ncelebrated *Riemann hypothesis* asserts that all nontrivial zeros $s$ of\nthe zeta function satisfy the much more precise equation\n${\\operatorname{Re}}(s) = 1/2$. If true, the hypothesis would have\nprofound consequences on the distribution of primes in the\nintegers\u00a0[@patterson].\n\n[9]{} Lars Ahlfors, *Complex Analysis, Third Edition*, McGraw\u2013Hill,\nInc., 1979.
