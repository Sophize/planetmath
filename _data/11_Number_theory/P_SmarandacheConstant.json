  "statement": "The *Smarandache constant* is the minimal solution $x_{\\min}$ of the\ngeneralized Andrica equation: $p_{n+1}^{x}-p_{n}^{x}=1$ where $p_n$ is\nthe n$^{\\text{th}}$ prime number, and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The exact\nvalue of the Smarandache constant and whether it exists is currently\nunknown, however according to the generalized Andrica conjecture\nproposed by Florentin Smarandache the value of the Smarandache constant\nis $x_{\\min}\\approx0.5671481302\\ldots$\n\nThe Smarandache constant should not be confused with a list of sixteen\nSmarandache constants $s_{1}-s_{16}$ defined as limits of different\nconvergent series involving the Smarandache function.",
