  "definition": "A *numeration system* is a triple $N=(b,\\Sigma,d)$, where $b>1$ is a\npositive integer, $\\Sigma$ is a non-empty alphabet, and $d$ is a\none-to-one function from $\\Sigma$ to the set of non-negative integers\n$\\mathbb{N}\\cup \\lbrace 0\\rbrace$. Order elements of $\\Sigma$ so that\ntheir values are in increasing order:\n\n> $\\Sigma=\\lbrace a_1,\\ldots, a_k\\rbrace$, where $d(a_i)< d(a_{i+1})$\n> for $i=1,\\ldots, k-1$.\n\n$b$ is called the *base* of numeration system $N$, and the elements\n$a_1,\\ldots,a_k$ the *digits* of $N$. Words over $\\Sigma$ are called\n*numeral words*.\n\nGiven a numeral word $u=c_1\\cdots c_m$ with $c_j\\in \\Sigma$, the integer\nnon-negative $n$ is said to be *represented* by $u$ if\n$$n= c_1 b^{m-1} + \\cdots + c_j b^{m-j} + \\cdots + c_m.$$ An integer $n$\nis said to be representable in $N$ if there is a numeral word $u$\nrepresenting $n$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n-   The most common numeration system is the decimal system:\n    $$D=(10,\\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\rbrace, d)$$ where $d(i)=i$ is\n    the identity function.\n\n-   Just as common is the binary digital system:\n    $B=(2,\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace,d)$ where $d$ again is the identity\n    function.\n\n-   In fact, any digital system is a numeration system $(n,\\Sigma,d)$,\n    where $\\Sigma=\\lbrace a_0,\\ldots,a_{n-1}\\rbrace$ and $d(a_i)=i$.\n\n-   Consider the system $B_1=(2,\\lbrace 1\\rbrace,d)$, where $d(1)=1$.\n    Since any word over $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ is just a string of $1$\u2019s,\n    $n$ consecutive strings of $1$ represent\n    $1+2+\\cdots +2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}$. We conclude that the integers\n    representable by $N$ have the form $2^n-1$ for any positive integer\n    $n$.\n\n-   Consider the system\n    $$D_1=(10,\\lbrace [0],[1],\\ldots,[9],[10],[100],[1000],[10000],[10000000],[10000000000]\\rbrace,d)$$\n    where $d([i])=i$. It is easy to see that every integer is\n    representable by $D_1$. However, some integers may be represented by\n    more than one numeral words. For example,\n    $$[1000]=[100][0]=[10][0][0]=[1][0][0][0].$$ The numeration system\n    $D_1$ is used by the Chinese.\n\n-   Consider the system $N=(3,\\lbrace [1],[2],[4]\\rbrace,d)$ where\n    $d([i])=i$. Then\n    $[2][1][4][1] = 2\\times 3^3 + 1\\times 3^2 + 4\\times 3 + 1 =  184$.\n    Notice that $0$ can not be represented $N$. Also, note that\n    $[4]=4=1\\times 3+1 = [1][1]$.\n\nA numeration system $N$ is said to be *complete* if every non-negative\ninteger has at least one representation in $N$; and *unambiguous* if\nevery non-negative integer has at most one representation in $N$. $N$ is\n*ambiguous* if $N$ is not unambiguous. Every digital system is complete\nand unambiguous. In the examples above, $D_1$ is complete but ambiguous;\n$B_1$ is unambiguous but not complete; $N$ is neither complete nor\nunambiguous.\n\n**Remark**. Representation non-negative integers by a numeration system\ncan be extended to rational numbers. The corresponding concepts of\ncompleteness and ambiguity may be defined similarly.\n\n[9]{} A.
