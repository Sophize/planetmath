  "definition": "Given a length $k$ and a multiplier $m$, a [*Hurwitz equation*]{} for a\nset of integers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots , x_k$ states that\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^k {x_i}^2 = m\\prod_{i = 1}^k x_i.$$\n\nThere is no solution to the equation if $m > k$. Solutions can sometimes\nbe found for $m \\leq k$ by starting from a $k$-long set of 1s. The\nMarkov equation for the Markov numbers has $k = m = 3$.\n\n[2]{} R. K.
