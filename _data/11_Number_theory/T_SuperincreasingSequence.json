  "definition": "A sequence $\\{s_j\\}$ of real numbers is *superincreasing* if\n$\\displaystyle s_{n+1} > \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j$ for every positive integer\n$n$. That is, any element of the sequence is greater than all of the\nprevious elements added together.\n\nA commonly used superincreasing sequence is that of powers of two\n($s_n = 2^n$.)\n\nSuppose that $\\displaystyle x=\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j s_j$. If $\\{s_j\\}$ is a\nsuperincreasing sequence and every $a_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, then we can always\ndetermine the $a_j$\u2019s simply by knowing $x$. This is analogous to the\nfact that, for any natural number, we can always determine which bits\nare on and off in the binary bitstring representing the number.",
