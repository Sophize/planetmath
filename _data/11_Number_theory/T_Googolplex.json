  "definition": "A *googolplex* is $10^{10^{100}}$; that is, 10 raised to the googol-th\npower. This can also be viewed as a one followed by a googol of zeros at\nits right. A googoplex is much larger than a googol. In fact, since a\ngoogolplex has a googol number of zeros in its decimal representation, a\ngoogoplex has more digits than there are atoms in our universe. Thus,\neven if all matter in the universe were at one\u2019s disposal, it would not\nbe possible to write down the decimal\u00a0representation of a googolplex.",
