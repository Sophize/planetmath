  "definition": "An [*almost perfect number*]{} or [*least deficient number*]{} is a\nnumber $n$ whose proper divisors add up to just one less than itself.\nThat is, $\\sigma(n) - n = n - 1$, with $\\sigma(n)$ being the sum of\ndivisors function. Currently, the only known almost perfect numbers are\nthe integer powers of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.) No one\nhas been able to prove that there are almost perfect numbers of a\ndifferent form.",
