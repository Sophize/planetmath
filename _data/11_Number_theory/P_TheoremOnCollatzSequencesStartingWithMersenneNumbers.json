  "statement": "[**Theorem.**]{} Given a Mersenne number $m = 2^n - 1$ (with $n$ a\nnonnegative integer), the Collatz sequence starting with $m$ reaches\n$3^n - 1$ in precisely $2n$ steps. Also, the parity of such a sequence\nconsistenly alternates parity until $3^n - 1$ is reached. For example,\ngiven $2^2 - 1 = 3$ gives the Collatz sequence 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1,\nin which $3^2 - 1 = 8$ is reached at the fourth step. Also, the least\nsignificant bits of this particular sequence are 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.\n\nAs you might already know, a Collatz sequence results from the repeated\napplication of the Collatz function $C(n) = 3n + 1$ for odd $n$ and\n$C(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$ for even $n$. If I may, I\u2019d like to introduce the\niterated Collatz function notation as a recurrence relation thus:\n$C_0(n) = n$ and $C_i(n) = C(C_{i - 1}(n))$ for all $i > 0$. In our\nexample, $C_0(3) = 3$, $C_1(3) = 10$, $C_2(3) = 5$, etc. (We could\nchoose to have $C_1(n) = n$ instead with only slight changes to the\ntheorem and its proof).\n\nObviously $m = C_0(2^n - 1) = 2^n - 1$ is an odd number. Therefore\n$C_1(m) = 2^n 3 - 2$, an even number, and then\n$C_2(m) = 2^{n - 1} 3 - 1$, $C_3(m) = 2^{n - 1} 9 - 2$,\n$C_4(m) = 2^{n - 2} 9 - 1$, $C_5(m) = 2^{n - 2} 27 - 2$, etc. We can now\ngeneralize that if $i$ is odd, then\n$C_i(m) = 2^{n - \\frac{i - 1}{2}} 3^{\\frac{i + 1}{2}} - 2$ and\n$C_i(m) = 2^{n - \\frac{i}{2}} 3^{\\frac{i}{2}}$ if $i$ is even. By\nplugging in $i = 2n$, we get\n$C_i(m) = 2^{n - \\frac{2n}{2}} 3^{\\frac{2n}{2}} = 2^{n - n} 3^n - 1 = 2^0 3^n - 1 = 3^n - 1$,\nproving the theorem.\n\nOf course the generalized formulas do not work when $i > 2n$, nor does\nany of this give any insight into when a Collatz sequence starting with\na Mersenne number reaches a power of 2. Likewise, the pattern of\nconsistently alternating parity usually breaks down on or right after\nthe $2n$th step.",
