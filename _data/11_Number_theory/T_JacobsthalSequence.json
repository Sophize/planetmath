  "definition": "The [*Jacobsthal sequence*]{} is an additive sequence similar to the\nFibonacci sequence, defined by the recurrence relation\n$J_n = J_{n - 1} + 2J_{n - 2}$, with initial terms $J_0 = 0$ and\n$J_1 = 1$. A number in the sequence is called a [*Jacobsthal number*]{}.\nThe first few are 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, etc., listed\nin A001045 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS.\n\nThe $n$th Jacobsthal number is the numerator of the alternating sum\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^n (-1)^{i - 1} \\frac{1}{2^i}$$ (the denominators are\npowers of two). This suggests a closed form: by putting the series\nsolution over a common denominator and summing the geometric series in\nthe numerator, we obtain two equations, one for even-indexed terms of\nthe sequence, $$J_{2n} = \\frac{2^{2n} - 1}{3}$$ and the other one for\nthe odd-indexed terms, $$J_{2n + 1} = \\frac{2^{2n + 1} - 2}{3} + 1.$$\nThese equations can be further generalized to\n$$J_n = \\frac{(-1)^{n - 1} + 2^n}{3}.$$\n\nThe Jacobsthal numbers are named after the German mathematician Ernst\nJacobsthal.",
