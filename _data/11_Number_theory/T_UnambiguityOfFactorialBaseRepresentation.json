  "definition": "For all positive integers $n$, it is the case that\n$$n! = 1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} k \\cdot k!$$\n\nWe first consider two degenerate cases. When $n=0$ or $n=1$, the sum has\nno terms because the lower limit is bigger than the upper limit. By the\nconvention that a sum with no terms equals zero, the equation reduces to\n$0! = 1$ or $1! = 1$, which is correct.\n\nNext, assume that $n > 1$. Note that\n$$k \\cdot k! = (k + 1) k! - k! = (k + 1)! - k!,$$ hence, we have a\ntelescoping sum:\n$$\\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} k \\cdot k! = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1}\n\\left( (k + 1)! - k! \\right) = n! - 1$$ Adding 1, we conclude that\n$$n! = 1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} k \\cdot k!$$\n\nIf $d_m \\ldots d_2 d_1$ is the factoradic representation of a positive\ninteger $n$, then $(d_m + 1) \\, m! > n \\ge d_m \n\\cdot m!$\n\nBy definition, $$n = d_m \\cdot m! + \\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} d_k \\cdot k! .$$\nSince each term of the sum is nonnegative, the sum is positive, hence\n$n \\ge d_m \\cdot m!$. Using the fact that $0 \\le d_k < k$ to bound each\nterm in the sum, we have\n$$n \\le d_m \\cdot m! + \\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} k \\cdot k!.$$ By theorem 1, the\nright-hand side equals $m! - 1$, so we have\n$n \\le d_m \\cdot m! + m! - 1$, which is the same as saying\n$(d_m + 1) \\, m! > n$.\n\nIf $d_m \\ldots d_2 d_1$ and ${d'}_{m'} \\ldots {d'}_2 {d'}_1$ are\ndistinct factoradic representations with $d_m \\neq 0$ and ${d'}_{m'}\n\\neq 0$ (i.e. not padded with leading zeros), then they denote distinct\nintegers.\n\nLet $n = \\sum_{k=1}^m d_k \\cdot k!$ and let $n' = \\sum_{k=1}^{m'} \n{d'}_k \\cdot k!$.\n\nSuppose that $m$ and $m'$ are distinct. Without loss of generality, we\nmay assume that $m < m'$. Then, $(m+1)! \\le {m'}!$. By theorem 2, we\nhave $n < (d_m + 1) \\, m!$ and $d_{m'} \\cdot {m'}! \\le n'$. Because\n$d_m \\le m$, we have $(d_m + 1) \\,m! \\le (m + 1) \\, m! = (m + 1)!$.\nBecause $d_{m'} \\neq 0$, we have $n' > {m'}!$. Hence, $n < n'$, so $n$\ndoes not equal $n'$.\n\nTo complete the proof, we use the method of infinite descent. Assume\nthat factoradic representations are not unique. Then there must exist a\nleast integer $n$ such that $n$ has two distinct factoradic\nrepresentations $d_m \\ldots d_2 d_1$ and\n${d'}_{m'} \\ldots {d'}_2 {d'}_1$ with $d_m \\neq 0$ and\n${d'}_{m'} \\neq 0$. By the conclusion of the previous paragraph, we must\nhave $m = m'$. By theorem 2, we must have $d_m = {d'}_m$. Let $m_1$ be\nthe chosen such that $d_{m_1} \\neq 0$ but\n$d_{m_1 + 1} = \\cdots = d_{m-1} = 0$ and let $m_2$ be the chosen such\nthat ${d'}_{m_2} \\neq 0$ but ${d'}_{m_2 + 1} = \n\\cdots = {d'}_{m-1} = 0$. Then $d_{m_1} \\ldots d_2 d_1$ and ${d'}_{m_2}\n\\ldots {d'}_2 {d'}_1$ would be distinct factoradic representations of\n$n - d_m \\cdot m!$ whose leading digits are not zero but this would\ncontradict the assumption that $n$ is the smallest number with this\nproperty.",
