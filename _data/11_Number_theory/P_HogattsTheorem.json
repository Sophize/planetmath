  "statement": "Hogatt\u2019s theorem states that every positive integer can be expressed as\na sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFor any positive integer, $k\\in{{\\mathbb}{Z}}^+$, there exists a unique\npositive integer $n$ so that $F_{n-1} < k \\leq F_n$. We proceed by\nstrong induction on $n$. For $k=0,1,2,3$, the property is true as\n$0,1,2,3$ are themselves Fibonacci numbers. Suppose $k\\geq 4$ and that\nevery integer less than $k$ is a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. Let\n$n$ be the largest positive integer such that $F_n<k$. We first note\nthat if $k-F_n > F_{n-1}$ then\n$$F_{n+1} \\geq k > F_n + F_{n-1} = F_{n+1},$$ giving us a contradiction.\nHence $k-F_n \\leq F_{n-1}$ and consequently the positive integer\n$(k-F_n)$ can be expressed as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.\nMoreover, this sum does not contain the term $F_n$ as\n$k-F_n \\leq F_{n-1} < F_n$. Hence,$k = (k-F_n) + F_n$ is a sum of\ndistinct Fibonacci numbers and Hogatt\u2019s theorem is proved by induction.",
