  "definition": "Definitions\n===========\n\nLet $R$ be any Dedekind domain with field of fractions $K$. Fix a finite\ndimensional field extension $L/K$ and let $S$ denote the integral\nclosure of $R$ in $L$. For any basis $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ of $L$ over $K$,\nthe determinant\n$$\\Delta(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) := \\det[{\\operatorname{Tr}}(x_i x_j)],$$ whose\nentries are the trace of $x_i x_j$ over all pairs $i,j$, is called the\n[*discriminant*]{} of the basis $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$. The ideal in $R$\ngenerated by all discriminants of the form\n$$\\Delta(x_1,\\ldots,x_n),\\ \\ x_i \\in S$$ is called the [*discriminant\nideal*]{} of $S$ over $R$, and denoted $\\Delta(S/R)$.\n\nIn the special case where $S$ is a free $R$\u2013module, the discriminant\nideal $\\Delta(S/R)$ is always a principal ideal, generated by any\ndiscriminant of the form $\\Delta(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ where $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$\nis a basis for $S$ as an $R$\u2013module. In particular, this situation holds\nwhenever $K$ and $L$ are number fields.\n\nAlternative notations\n=====================\n\nThe discriminant is sometimes denoted with $\\operatorname{disc}$ instead\nof $\\Delta$. In the context of number fields, one often writes\n$\\operatorname{disc}(L/K)$ for\n$\\operatorname{disc}(\\mathcal{O}_L/\\mathcal{O}_K)$ where $\\mathcal{O}_L$\nand $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are the rings of algebraic integers of $L$ and $K$.\nIf $K$ or $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is omitted, it is typically assumed to be\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\nThe discriminant is so named because it allows one to determine which\nideals of $R$ are ramified in $S$. Specifically, the prime ideals of $R$\nthat ramify in $S$ are precisely the ones that contain the discriminant\nideal $\\Delta(S/R)$. In the case $R = \\mathbb{Z}$, that any ring of\nintegers $S$ of a number field larger than $\\mathbb{Q}$ has discriminant\nstrictly smaller than $\\mathbb{Z}$ itself, and this fact combined with\nthe previous result shows that any number field $K \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$\nadmits at least one ramified prime over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nOther types of discriminants\n============================\n\nIn the special case where $L = K[x]$ is a primitive separable field\nextension of degree $n$, the discriminant $\\Delta(1,x,\\ldots,x^{n-1})$\nis equal to the of the minimal polynomial $f(X)$ of $x$ over $K[X]$.\n\nThe discriminant of an elliptic curve can be obtained by taking the\npolynomial discrimiant of its Weierstrass polynomial, and the modular\ndiscriminant of a complex lattice equals the discriminant of the\nelliptic curve represented by the corresponding lattice quotient.",
