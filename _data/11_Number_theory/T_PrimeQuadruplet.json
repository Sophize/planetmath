  "definition": "A *prime quadruplet* is a set of four prime numbers,\n$p, p + 2, p + 6, p + 8$. In most cases, $p + 4$ is a multiple of 15.\nThe only quadruplet for which this is not the case is 5, 7, 11, 13,\nwhich overlaps with the quadruplet 11, 13, 17, 19. Sometimes 2, 3, 5, 7\nis referred to as a prime quadruplet.\n\nIf the twin prime conjecture is ever proven it is possible that it might\nneither prove nor disprove the prime quadruplet conjecture.\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the members of the prime quadruplets is\nBrun\u2019s constant for prime quadruplets, $B_4 \\approx  0.87058838$.",
