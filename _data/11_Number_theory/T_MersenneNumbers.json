  "definition": "Numbers of the form $$M_n = 2^n - 1, (n \\geq 1)$$ are called *Mersenne\nnumbers* after Father Marin Mersenne (1588 - 1648), a French monk who\nstudied which of these numbers are actually prime. It can be easily\nshown that if $M_n$ is prime then $n$ is prime. Indeed, $2^{a\\cdot b}-1$\nwith $a,\\ b >1$ factors:\n$$2^{a\\cdot b}-1=(2^a-1)(2^{a(b-1)}+2^{a(b-2)}+\\ldots+2^a+1).$$ If $M_n$\nis prime then we call it a *Mersenne prime*. Mersenne primes have a\nstrong connection with perfect numbers.\n\nThe currently known Mersenne primes correspond to $n$ = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13,\n17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253,\n4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503,\n132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377,\n6972593, 13,466,917 and the newly discovered $40^{\\operatorname{th}}$\nnumber $n=20996011$, and even newer $41^{\\operatorname{st}}$ number\n$n=24036583$. The latest Mersenne primes (as of $2/5/2006$) are the\n$42$nd Mersenne number which corresponds to $n=25964951$ (and which has\nmore than $7.8$ million digits) and the $43$rd Mersenne prime for\n$n=30402457$ (the new prime is $9,152,052$ digits long). For an updated\nlist and a lot more information on how these numbers were discovered,\nyou can check: .\n\nIt is conjectured that the density of Mersenne primes with exponent\n$p<x$ is of order $$\\frac{e^{\\gamma}}{\\log 2} \\log \\log x$$ where\n$\\gamma$ is Euler\u2019s constant.",
