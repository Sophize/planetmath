  "statement": "The special case of Dirichlet\u2019s theorem for primes in arithmetic\nprogressions for primes congruent to $1$ modulo $q$ where $q$ itself is\na prime can be established by the following elegant modification of .\n\nLet $f(n)=\\frac{n^q-1}{n-1}=1+n+n^2+\\dotsb+n^{q-1}$. Let $n>1$ be an\ninteger, and suppose $p\\mid f(n)$. Then $n^q\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ which\nimplies by Lagrange\u2019s theorem that either $q\\mid p-1$ or\n$n\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. In other words, every prime divisor of $f(n)$ is\ncongruent to $1$ modulo $q$ unless $n$ is congruent to $1$ modulo that\ndivisor.\n\nSuppose there are only finitely many primes that are congruent to $1$\nmodulo $q$. Let $P$ be twice their product. Note that\n$P\\equiv 2\\pmod q$. Let $p$ be any prime divisor of $f(P)$. If\n$p\\equiv 1\\pmod q$, then $p\\mid P$ which contradicts\n$f(P)\\equiv 1\\pmod P$. Therefore, by the above $P\\equiv 1\\pmod p$.\nTherefore\n$f(P)\\equiv 1+P+P^2+\\dotsb+P^{q-1}\\equiv 1+1+1+\\dotsb+1\\equiv q\\pmod p$.\nSince $q$ is prime, it follows that $p=q$. Then $P\\equiv 1\\pmod p$\nimplies $P\\equiv 1\\pmod q$. However, that is inconsistent with our\ndeduction that $P\\equiv 2\\pmod q$ above. Therefore the original\nassumption that there are only finitely many primes congruent to $1$\nmodulo $q$ is false.\n\n[1]{}\n\nHenryk Iwaniec and Emmanuel Kowalski. , volume\u00a053 of [*AMS Colloquium\nPublications*]{}.
