A Fermat number $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$ is prime\nonly if $$3^{\\frac{F_n - 1}{2}} \\equiv -1 \\mod F_n.$$ In other words, if\n3 raised to the largest power of two not greater than the Fermat number\nleaves as a remainder the next higher power of two when divided by that\nFermat number (since $F_n - 1 = 2^{2^n}$), then that Fermat number is a\nFermat prime.\n\nFor example, $17 = 2^{2^2} + 1$ is a Fermat prime, and we can see that\n$3^8 = 6561$, which leaves a remainder of 16 when divided by 17. The\nsmallest Fermat number not to be a prime is 4294967297, as it is the\nproduct of 641 and 6700417, and $3^{2147483648}$ divided by 4294967297\nleaves a remainder of 10324303 rather than 4294967296.",
