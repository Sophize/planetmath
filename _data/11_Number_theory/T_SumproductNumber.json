  "definition": "A *sum-product number* is an integer $n$ that in a given base satisfies\nthe equality\n\n$$n = \\sum_{i = 1}^m d_i \\prod_{i = 1}^m d_i$$\n\nwhere $d_i$ is a digit of $n$, and $m$ is the number of digits of $n$.\nThis means a test of whether the sum of the digits of $n$ times the\nproduct of the digits of $n$ is equal to $n$.\n\nFor example, the number 128 in base 7 is a sum-product number since\n\n$$242_7 = (2 + 4 + 2)(2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2)$$\n\nAll sum-product numbers are Harshad numbers, too.\n\n0 and 1 are sum-product numbers in any positional base. The proof that\nthe set of sum-product numbers in base 2 is finite is elementary enough\nnot to inspire claims of authorship. The proof that the set of\nsum-product numbers in base 10 is finite (specifically, 0, 1, 135 and\n144) is more involved but within the realm of basic algebra, and it\npoints the way to a formulation of the proof that number of sum-product\nnumbers in any base is finite.",
