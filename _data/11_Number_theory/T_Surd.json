  "definition": "In mathematics, numbers often have to be written using roots or\nfractional exponents. For example, the number $\\sqrt{2}$ cannot be\nwritten without using a root or writing $2^{1/2}$. A *surd* is an\nirrational number which can be written as the sum of rational powers of\nrational numbers. Another example would be $3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt[3]{5}$.\n\nReferences {#references .unnumbered}\n----------",
