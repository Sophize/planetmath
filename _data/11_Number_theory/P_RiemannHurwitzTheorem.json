  "statement": "First we define the different divisor of an extension of function\nfields. Let $K$ be a function field over a field $F$ and let $L$ be a\nfinite separable extension of $K$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_P$ be a prime of\n$K$, i.e. a discrete valuation ring with $F\\subset \\mathcal{O}_P$,\nmaximal ideal $P$ and quotient field equal to $K$. Let $R_P$ be the\nintegral closure of $\\mathcal{O}_P$ in $L$. Notice that if\n$\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal of $R_P$, then the localization\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{p}}=(R_P)_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a prime of $L$\n(which is said to be lying over $\\mathcal{O}_P$). The maximal ideal of\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is $\\mathfrak{p}(R_P)_{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{O}_\\mathfrak{P}$ be any prime of $L$, then it lays over\nsome prime ideal $P$ of $K$ and in fact, if\n$\\mathfrak{p}=R_P\\cap \\mathfrak{P}$ then\n$\\mathcal{O}_\\mathfrak{p}\\cong \\mathcal{O}_\\mathfrak{P}$. Let\n$\\delta(\\mathfrak{P})$ be the exact power of $\\mathfrak{p}$ dividing the\ndifferent of $R_P$ over $\\mathcal{O}_P$ (the different of an extension\nof Dedekind domains is a fractional ideal). We define the different\ndivisor of $L/K$ as follows:\n$$D_{L/K}=\\sum_\\mathfrak{P} \\delta({\\mathfrak{P}})\\mathfrak{P}$$ as an\nelement of the free abelian group generated by the prime ideals of $L$.\n\nLet $L/K$ be a finite, separable, geometric extension of function fields\nand suppose the genus of $K$ is $g_K$. Then the genus of $L$ is given by\nthe formula: $$2g_L-2=[L:K](2g_K-2)+\\deg_L D_{L/K}.$$",
