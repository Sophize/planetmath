  "definition": "A [*polite number*]{} $n$ is an integer that is the sum of two or more\nconsecutive nonnegative integers in at least one way. To put it\nalgebraically, if $n$ is polite then there is a solution to\n$$n = \\sum_{i = a}^b i$$ with $b > a$ and $a > -1$. For example, 42 is a\npolite number since it is the sum of the integers from 3 to 9. The first\nfew polite numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18,\n19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,\n38, 39, 40, etc.\n\nObviously all triangular numbers are polite numbers. So are all odd\nnumbers. In fact, the numbers that are not polite are the powers of 2.",
