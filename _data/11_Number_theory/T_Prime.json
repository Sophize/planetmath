  "definition": "An integer $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is prime if it has exactly two positive\ndivisors. The first few positive prime numbers are\n$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\dots$.\n\nA prime number is often (but not always) required to be positive.\n\nPrime numbers are very important objects in many fields of mathematics.\nThe notion of prime number has been generalized in a number of ways.\n\nIn class field theory, one defines a prime to be a family of equivalent\nvaluations; using this definition, the primes of the rational numbers\nare given by the positive prime numbers (for a prime $p$, the\ncorresponding valuation is the $p$-adic absolute value) and one extra\nprime usually denoted $\\infty$ (corresponding to the usual absolute\nvalue on $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n\nIn ring theory, one defines the notion of a prime ideal, and also a\nnotion of . However, the notion of prime ideal is more natural in this\ncontext than the notion of prime element. For number fields, for\nexample, one has unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals but\none does not always have unique factorization of elements into prime\nelements. The prime ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are the ideals generated by\nthe prime numbers, as well as the zero ideal. Note that the ideal\ngenerated by $p$ is the same as the ideal generated by $-p$, so we can\nconsider negative primes equivalent to positive primes from this\nviewpoint as well.",
