  "statement": "[**Conjecture (Hardy & Littlewood).**]{} Given integers $x \\ge y > 1$,\nit is never the case that $\\pi(x + y) > (\\pi(x) + \\pi(y))$, where\n$\\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function.\n\nFor example: There are 269 primes below 1729. There are 304840 primes\nbelow 4330747. If we add up these values of the prime counting function,\nwe get 305109. This is more than $\\pi(4330747 + 1729) = 304949$.\n\nCrandall and Pomerance believe this conjecture to be false but also that\nany counterexample is way too large to be discovered today. If we limit\nourselves to 100 for both variables,\n$n = \\pi(x + y) - (\\pi(x) + \\pi(y))$ tends to fall in the range\n$-8 < n < 1$.\n\n[1]{} R. Crandall & C.
