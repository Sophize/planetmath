  "definition": "Polynomial rings in one variable\n================================\n\nLet $R$ be a ring. The *polynomial ring* over $R$ in one variable $X$ is\nthe set $R[X]$ of all sequences in $R$ with only finitely many nonzero\nterms. If $(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots)$ is an element in $R[X]$, with\n$a_n = 0$ for all $n > N$, then we usually write this element as\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^N a_n X^n = a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + a_3 X^3 + \\cdots + a_N X^N.$$\nElements of $R[X]$ are called *polynomials* in the indeterminate $X$\nwith coefficients in $R$. The ring elements $a_0, \\ldots, a_N$ are\ncalled *coefficients* of the polynomial, and the *degree* of a\npolynomial is the largest natural number $N$ for which $a_N \\neq 0$, if\nsuch an $N$ exists. When a polynomial has all of its coefficients equal\nto $0$, its degree is usually considered to be undefined, although some\npeople adopt the convention that its degree is $-\\infty$.\n\nA *monomial* is a polynomial with exactly one nonzero coefficient.\nSimilarly, a *binomial* is a polynomial with exactly two nonzero\ncoefficients, and a *trinomial* is a polynomial with exactly three\nnonzero coefficients.\n\nAddition and multiplication of polynomials is defined by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{n=0}^N a_n X^n + \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n X^n & = & \\sum_{n=0}^N (a_n+b_n) X^n \\\\\n\\sum_{n=0}^N a_n X^n \\cdot \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n X^n & = & \\sum_{n=0}^{2N} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\\right) X^n\\end{aligned}$$\n$R[X]$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}$\u2013graded ring under these operations, with the\nmonomials of degree exactly $n$ comprising the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ graded\ncomponent of $R[X]$. The zero element of $R[X]$ is the polynomial whose\ncoefficients are all $0$, and when $R$ has a multiplicative identity\n$1$, the polynomial whose coefficients are all $0$ except for $a_0 = 1$\nis a multiplicative identity for the polynomial ring $R[X]$.\n\nPolynomial rings in finitely many variables\n===========================================\n\nThe *polynomial ring* over $R$ in two variables $X,Y$ is defined to be\n$R[X,Y] := R[X][Y] \\cong R[Y][X]$. Elements of $R[X,Y]$ are called\n*polynomials* in the indeterminates $X$ and $Y$ with coefficients in\n$R$. A *monomial* in $R[X,Y]$ is a polynomial which is simultaneously a\nmonomial in both $X$ and $Y$, when considered as a polynomial in $X$\nwith coefficients in $R[Y]$ (or as a polynomial in $Y$ with coefficients\nin $R[X]$). The *degree* of a monomial in $R[X,Y]$ is the sum of its\nindividual degrees in the respective indeterminates $X$ and $Y$ (in\n$R[Y][X]$ and $R[X][Y]$), and the degree of a polynomial in $R[X,Y]$ is\nthe supremum of the degrees of its monomial summands, if it has any.\n\nIn three variables, we have\n$R[X,Y,Z] := R[X,Y][Z] = R[X][Y][Z] \\cong R[X][Z][Y] \\cong \\cdots$, and\nin any finite number of variables, we have inductively\n$R[X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n] := R[X_1,\\dots,X_{n-1}][X_n] = R[X_1][X_2]\\cdots[X_n]$,\nwith monomials and degrees defined in analogy to the two variable case.\nIn any number of variables, a polynomial ring is a graded ring with\n$n^\\mathrm{th}$ graded component equal to the $R$-module generated by\nthe monomials of degree $n$.\n\nPolynomial rings in arbitrarily many variables\n==============================================\n\nFor any nonempty set $M$, let $E(M)$ denote the set of all finite\nsubsets of $M$. For each element $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots ,a_n\\}$ of $E(M)$,\nset $R[A]:=R[a_1,\\ldots,a_n]$. Any two elements $A,B \\in E(M)$\nsatisfying $A \\subset B$ give rise to the relationship\n$R[A] \\subset R[B]$ if we consider $R[A]$ to be embedded in $R[B]$ in\nthe obvious way. The union of the rings $\\{R[A] : A \\in E(M)\\}$ (or,\nmore formally, the categorical direct limit of the direct system of\nrings $\\{R[A] : A \\in E(M)\\}$) is defined to be the ring $R[M]$.",
