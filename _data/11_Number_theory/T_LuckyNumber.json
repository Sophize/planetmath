  "definition": "A [*lucky number*]{} is an integer that remains after a sieving process\nsimilar to a sieving process for prime numbers. The first few lucky\nnumbers are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, 43, 49, 51, 63, 67,\n69, 73, 75, 79, 87, 93, 99, etc., listed in A000959 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS.\nThere are infinitely many lucky numbers. These numbers share some\nproperties with prime numbers, mostly in regards to distribution. was\nthe first to study these numbers.\n\nThe sieve process for the lucky numbers begins with a list of odd\npositive integers from 1 to whatever limit one wishes (let\u2019s say 49). We\ncircle 1 and 3 and cross out every third number that remains (counting\nfrom the beginning):\n$$1, 3, \\not{5}, 7, 9, \\not{11}, 13, 15, \\not{17}, 19, \\ldots$$ Then we\ncircle the number next to the one that we last circled and cross out\nevery $x$th term as indicated by the number we just circled, in this\ncase, 7, starting the count from the beginning but not counting numbers\nthat have already been struck out:\n$$1, 3, \\not{5}, 7, 9, \\not{11}, 13, 15, \\not{17}, \\not{19}, \\ldots$$\nThis step is repeated until every number in our list has been either\ncircled or crossed out. The numbers that remain are \u201clucky\u201d because they\nsurvived the process without ever being struck.\n\nThe \u201clucky number theorem\u201d is almost the same as the prime number\ntheorem.",
