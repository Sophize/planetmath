  "definition": "The [*iterated sum of divisors function*]{} $\\sigma^k(n)$ is $a_k$ in\nthe recurrence relation $a_0 = n$ and $a_i = \\sigma(a_{i - 1})$ for\n$i > 0$, where $\\sigma(x)$ is the sum of divisors function.\n\nSince $n$ itself is included in the set of its divisors, the sequence\ngenerated by repeated iterations is an increasing sequence (that is, in\nascending order). For example, iterating the sum of divisors function\nfor $n = 2$ gives the sequence 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 15, etc. Erd\u0151s conjectured\nthat there is a limit for $(\\sigma^k(n))^{\\frac{1}{k}}$ as $k$\napproaches infinity.\n\n[1]{} R.
