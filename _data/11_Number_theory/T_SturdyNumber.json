  "definition": "A *sturdy number* is a positive integer $n$ having a given binary weight\n(number of on bits, or instances of the digit 1 in its binary\nrepresentation) such that no multiple $mn$ (with $m$ being any positive\ninteger) has a lesser binary weight. For example, 10 is written 1010 in\nbinary; it has two on bits; any multiple of 10 has at least two on bits.\n\nAll powers of two corresponding to positive integer exponents are sturdy\nnumbers, since its representation can only have one on bit (the one\ncorresponding to the appropriate power of two), and multiplying by\nanother power of two gives yet another power of two, while multiplying\nby any other integer gives a number with at least two on bits.\n\nLikewise we can verify that integers having two on bits are also sturdy\nnumbers, since none of its multiples can be a power of two and therefore\nany multiple must also have at least two on bits.\n\nA125121 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS gives the following list of the first\nsixty-eight sturdy numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15,\n16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48,\n49, 51, 56, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, 75, 80, 84, 85,\n89, 90, 93, 96, 98, 102, 105, 112, 120, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130,\n132, 133, 135, 136. However, these were computed with the assumption\nthat it was only necessary to test up to $m = 14 \\times 10^7$.",
