  "definition": "A [*cuban prime*]{} is a prime number that is a solution to one of two\ndifferent specific equations involving third powers of $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe first of these equations is $$p = \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x - y},$$ with\n$x = y + 1$ and $y > 0$. The first few cuban primes from this equation\nare: 7, 19, 37, 61, 127, 271, 331, 397, 547, 631, 919.\n\nThe general cuban prime of this kind can be rewritten as\n$$\\frac{(y + 1)^3 - y^3}{y + 1 - y},$$ which simplifies to\n$3y^2 + 3y + 1$. This is exactly the general form of a centered\nhexagonal number; that is, all of these cuban primes are centered\nhexagonal numbers.\n\nThis kind of cuban primes has been researched by A. J. C. Cunningham, in\na paper entitled \u201dOn quasi-Mersennian numbers\u201d.\n\nAs of January 2006 the largest known cuban prime has 65537 digits with\n$y = 100000845^{4096}$, discovered by Jens Kruse Andersen, according to\nthe Prime Pages of the University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\nThe second of these equations is $$p = \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x - y},$$ with\n$x = y + 2$. It simplifies to $3y^2 + 6y + 4$. The first few cuban\nprimes on this form are: 13, 109, 193, 433, 769.\n\nThis kind of cuban primes have also been researched by Cunningham, in\nhis book [*Binomial Factorisations*]{}.\n\nThe name \u201ccuban prime\u201d has to do with the r\u00f4le cubes (third powers) play\nin the equations, and has nothing to do with the prime minister of Cuba.",
