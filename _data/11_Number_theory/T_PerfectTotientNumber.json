  "definition": "An integer $n$ is a [*perfect totient number*]{} if\n$$n = \\sum_{i = 1}^{c + 1} \\phi^i(n)$$, where $\\phi^i(x)$ is the\niterated totient function and $c$ is the integer such that\n$\\phi^c(n) = 2$.\n\nA082897 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS lists the first few perfect totient numbers: 3,\n9, 15, 27, 39, 81, 111, 183, 243, 255, 327, 363, 471, 729, 2187, 2199,\n3063, 4359, 4375, etc. It can be observed that many of these are\nmultiples of 3 (in fact, 4375 is the smallest one that is not divisible\nby 3) and in fact all $3^x$ for $x > 0$ are perfect totient numbers.\n\nFurthermore, $3p$ for a prime $p > 3$ is a perfect totient number if and\nonly if $p = 4n + 1$, where $n$ itself is also a perfect totient number.\nMohan and Suryanarayana showed why $3p$ can\u2019t be a perfect totient\nnumber when $p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$. In regards to $3^2p$, Ianucci et al\nshowed that if it is a perfect totient number then $p$ is a prime of one\nof three specific forms listen in their paper. It is not known if there\nare any perfect totient numbers of the form $3^xp$ for $x > 3$.\n\n[2]{} Perez Cacho, \u201cOn the sum of totients of successive orders,\u201d\n[*Revista Matematica Hispano-Americana*]{} [**5.3**]{} (1939): 45 - 50\nD.
