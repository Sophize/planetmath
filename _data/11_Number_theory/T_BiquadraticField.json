  "definition": "A [*biquadratic field*]{} (or [*biquadratic number field*]{}) is a\nbiquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. To discuss these fields more\neasily, the set $S$ will be defined to be the set of all squarefree\nintegers not equal to $1$. Thus, any biquadratic field is of the form\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m}, \\sqrt{n})$ for distinct elements $m$ and $n$ of\n$S$.\n\nLet $\\displaystyle k=\\frac{mn}{(\\gcd(m,n))^2}$. It can easily be\nverified that $k \\in S$, $k \\neq m$, and $k \\neq n$. Since\n$\\displaystyle \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{\\sqrt{mn}}{\\gcd(m,n)} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m}, \\sqrt{n})$,\nthe three distinct quadratic subfields of\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m}, \\sqrt{n})$ are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m})$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{n})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{k})$. Note that\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{k})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{mn})$.\n\nOf the three cyclotomic fields of four over $\\mathbb{Q}$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_8)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{12})$ are biquadratic\nfields. The quadratic subfields of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_8)$ are\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, and\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$; the quadratic subfields of\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{12})$ are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nNote that the only rational prime $p$ for which $e(P|p)=4$ is possible\nin a biquadratic field is $p=2$. (The notation $e(P|p)$ refers to the\nramification index of the prime ideal $P$ over $p$.) This occurs for\nbiquadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m}, \\sqrt{n})$ in which exactly two\nof $m$, $n$, and $k$ are to $2 \\operatorname{mod} 4$ and the other is to\n$3 \\operatorname{mod} 4$. For example, in\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_8)=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-1})$, we have that\n$e(P|2)=4$.\n\nCertain biquadratic fields provide excellent counterexamples to\nstatements that some people might think to be true. For example, the\nbiquadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-3})$ is useful for\ndemonstrating that a subring of a principal ideal domain need not be a\nprincipal ideal domain. It can easily be verified that $\\mathcal{O}_K$\n(the ring of integers of $K$) is a principal ideal domain, but\n$\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-6}]$, which is a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, is not a\nprincipal ideal domain. Also, biquadratic fields of the form\n$L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m}, \\sqrt{n})$ with $m$ and $n$ distinct elements of\n$S$ such that $m \\equiv 1 \\operatorname{mod} 3$ and\n$n \\equiv 1 \\operatorname{mod} 3$ are useful for demonstrating that\nrings of integers need not have . Note that $3$ splits completely in\nboth $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{m})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{n})$ and thus in $L$.\nTherefore, $3\\mathcal{O}_L=P_1P_2P_3P_4$ for distinct $P_1$, $P_2$,\n$P_3$, and $P_4$ of $\\mathcal{O}_L$. Now suppose\n$\\mathcal{O}_L=\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ for some $\\alpha \\in L$. Then\n$L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, and the minimal polynomial $f$ for $\\alpha$ over\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ has degree $4$. This yields that $f$, considered as a\npolynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_3$, is supposed to factor into four distinct\nmonic polynomials of degree $1$, which is a contradiction.",
