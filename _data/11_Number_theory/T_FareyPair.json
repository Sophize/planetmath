  "definition": "Two nonnegative reduced fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$ make a *Farey pair*\n(with $a/b < c/d$) whenever $bc-ad=1$, in other words, they are a Farey\npair if their difference is $1/bd$. The interval $[a/b, c/d]$ is known\nas a *Farey interval.*\n\nGiven a Farey pair $a/b,c/d$, their *mediant* is $(a+c)/(b+d)$. The\nmediant has the following property:\n\n[*If $[a,b,c/d]$ is a Farey interval, then the two subintervals obtained\nwhen inserting the mediant are also Farey pairs. Besides, between all\nfractions that are strictly between $a/b,c/d$, the mediant is the one\nhaving the smallest denominator.*]{}\n\n[**Example.**]{}\\\nNotice that $3/8$ and $5/11$ form a Farey pair, since\n$8\\cdot 5 - 3\\cdot 13 =40-391$. The mediant here is $8/21$.\n\nThen $3/8$ and $8/21$ form a Farey pair:\n$8\\cdot 8 - 3\\cdot 21 = 64-63=1$. No fraction between $3/8$ and $5/11$\nother than $8/21$ has a denominator smaller or equal than $21$.",
