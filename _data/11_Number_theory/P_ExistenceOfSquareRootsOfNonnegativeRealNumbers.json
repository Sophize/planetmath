  "statement": "Every non-negative real number has a square root.\n\nLet $x\\geq 0\\in\\mathbb{R}$. If $x=0$ then the result is trivial, so\nsuppose $x>0$ and define $S=\\{y\\in\\mathbb{R}:y> 0\\text{ and }y^2<x\\}$.\n$S$ is nonempty, for if $0<y<\\min\\{x,1\\}$, then $y^2< y<x$, and\n$y\\in S$. $S$ is also bounded above, for if $y>\\max\\{x,1\\}$, then\n$y^2>y>x$, so such a $y$ is an upper bound of $S$. Thus $S$ is nonempty\nand bounded, and hence has a supremum which we denote $L$. We will show\nthat $L^2=x$. First suppose $L^2<x$. By the Archimedean Principle there\nexists some $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $n>(2L+1)/(x-L^2)$. Then we have\n$$\\bigg(L+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\bigg)^2=L^2+\\dfrac{2L}{n}+\\dfrac{1}{n^2}\n<L^2+\\dfrac{2L}{n}+\\dfrac{1}{n}<x\\text{.}$$ So $L+1/n$ is a member of\n$S$ strictly greater than $L$, contrary to assumption. Now suppose that\n$L^2>x$. Again by the Archimedean Principle there exists some\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $1/n<(L^2-x)/2L$ and $1/n<L$. Then we have\n$$\\bigg(L-\\dfrac{1}{n}\\bigg)^2=L^2-\\dfrac{2L}{n}+\\dfrac{1}{n^2}\n>L^2-\\dfrac{2L}{n}>x\\text{.}$$ But there must exist some $y\\in S$ such\nthat $L-1/n<y<L$, which gives $x<\\big(L-1/n\\big)^2<y^2$, so that\n$y\\notin S$, a contradiction. Thus it must be that $L^2=x$.",
