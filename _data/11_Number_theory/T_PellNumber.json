  "definition": "A number in the sequence created from the recurrence relation\n$$P_n = 2P_{n - 1} + P_{n - 2},$$ with $$P_0 = 0$$ and $$P_1 = 1.$$ The\nfirst few Pell numbers are 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, listed\nin A000129 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS.\n\nA Pell number for any given index can also be calculated from earlier\nPell numbers with $$P_{a + b} = P_aP_{b + 1} + P_{a - 1}P_b.$$\n\nThe formula\n$${ {-{(1 - \\sqrt 2)}^n + {(1 + \\sqrt 2)}^n} \\over {2\\sqrt 2}}$$ works\ntoo. From this particular formula it can be deduced that the sequence of\nPell numbers can be used in a continued fraction of the square root of 2\nas well as the silver ratio.\n\nYet another way to calculate Pell numbers is by squaring the terms of\nPascal\u2019s triangle and adding up the antidiagonals. Arranging the Markov\nnumbers in a binary graph tree and reading the numbers on 2\u2019s branch\ngives the Pell numbers with odd indices.\n\nOnly Pell numbers with prime indexes can also be prime. This fact is\nused in some tests for pseudoprimality.",
