  "definition": "An positive integer $n$ is called *perfect* if it is the sum of all\npositive divisors of $n$ less than $n$ itself. It is not known if there\nare any odd perfect numbers, but all even perfect numbers have been\nclassified according to the following lemma:\n\nAn even number is perfect if and only if it equals $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)$ for\nsome integer $k>1$ and $2^k-1$ is prime.\\\n\nLet $\\sigma$ denote the sum of divisors function. Recall that this\nfunction is multiplicative.\n\nNecessity: Let $p=2^k-1$ be prime and $n=2^{k-1}p$. We have that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma(n) & = & \\sigma(2^{k-1}p)\\\\\n& = & \\sigma(2^{k-1}) \\sigma(p)\\\\\n& = & (2^k-1)(p+1)\\\\\n& = & (2^k-1)2^k\\\\\n& = & 2n,\\end{aligned}$$ which shows that $n$ is perfect.\n\nSufficiency: Assume $n$ is an even perfect number. Write $n=2^{k-1}m$\nfor some odd $m$ and some $k>1$. Then we have $\\gcd(2^{k-1},m)=1$. Thus,\n$$\\sigma(n)=\\sigma(2^{k-1}m)=\\sigma(2^{k-1})\\sigma(m)=(2^k-1)\\sigma(m).$$\nSince $n$ is perfect, $\\sigma(n)=2n$ by definition. Therefore,\n$\\sigma(n)=2n=2^km$. Piecing together the two formulas for $\\sigma(n)$\nyields $$2^km=(2^k-1)\\sigma(m).$$ Thus, $(2^k-1)\\mid 2^km$, which forces\n$(2^k-1)\\mid m$. Write $m=(2^k-1)M$. Note that $1\\le M<m$. From above,\nwe have: $$\\begin{aligned}\n2^km & = & (2^k-1)\\sigma(m) \\\\\n2^k(2^k-1)M & = & (2^k-1)\\sigma(m) \\\\\n2^kM & = & \\sigma(m)\\end{aligned}$$ Since $m\\mid m$ by definition of and\n$M\\mid m$ by assumption, we have $$2^kM=\\sigma(m)\\geq m+M=2^kM,$$ which\nforces $\\sigma(m)=m+M$. Therefore, $m$ has only two positive divisors,\n$m$ and $M$. Hence, $m$ must be prime, $M=1$, and $m=(2^k-1)M=2^k-1$,\nfrom which the result follows.\n\nThe lemma can be used to produce examples of (even) perfect numbers:\n\n-   If $k=2$, then $2^k-1=2^2-1=3$, which is prime. According to the\n    lemma, $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)=2^{2-1} \\cdot 3=6$ is perfect. Indeed,\n    $1+2+3=6$.\n\n-   If $k=3$, then $2^k-1=2^3-1=7$, which is prime. According to the\n    lemma, $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)=2^{3-1} \\cdot 7=28$ is perfect. Indeed,\n    $1+2+4+7+14=28$.\n\n-   If $k=5$, then $2^k-1=2^5-1=31$, which is prime. According to the\n    lemma, $2^{k-1}(2^k-1)=2^{5-1} \\cdot 31=496$ is perfect. Indeed,\n    $1+2+4+8+16+31+62+124+248=496$.\n\nNote that $k=4$ yields that $2^k-1=2^4-1=15$, which is not prime.\n\nThe sequence of known perfect numbers appears in the OEIS as sequence .",
