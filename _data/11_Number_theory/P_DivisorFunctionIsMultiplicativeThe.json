  "statement": "The is multiplicative.\n\n[**Proof.**]{} Let $t=mn$ with $m,n$ coprime. Applying the fundamental\ntheorem of arithmetic, we can write\n$$m=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_{r}^{a_r},\n  \\qquad n=q_1^{b_1}q_2^{b_2}\\cdots q_s^{b_s},$$ where each $p_j$ and\n$q_i$ are prime. Moreover, since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, we conclude\nthat\n$$t=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_{r}^{a_r}q_1^{b_1}q_2^{b_2}\\cdots q_s^{b_s}.$$\n\nNow, each divisor of $t$ is of the form\n$$t=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\\cdots p_{r}^{k_r}q_1^{h_1}q_2^{h_2}\\cdots q_s^{h_s}.$$\nwith $0\\leq k_j\\leq a_j$ and $0\\leq h_i\\leq b_i$, and for each such\ndivisor we get a divisor of $m$ and a divisor of $n$, given respectively\nby $$u=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\\cdots p_{r}^{k_r},\n  \\qquad v=q_1^{h_1}q_2^{h_2}\\cdots q_s^{h_s}.$$\n\nNow, each respective divisor of $m$, $n$ is of the form above, and for\neach such pair their product is also a divisor of $t$. Therefore we get\na bijection between the set of positive divisors of $t$ and the set of\npairs of divisors of $m$, $n$ respectively. Such bijection implies that\nthe cardinalities of both sets are the same, and thus\n$$d(mn)=d(m)d(n).$$",
