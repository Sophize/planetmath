  "statement": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then the binomial $x^n\\!-\\!1$ has as many\nwith integer coefficients as the integer $n$ has positive divisors, both\nnumbers thus being .\n\n[*Proof.*]{} If $\\Phi_d(x)$ generally means the $d$th cyclotomic\npolynomial\n$$\\Phi_d(x) := (x-\\zeta_1)(x-\\zeta_2)\\ldots(x-\\zeta_{\\varphi(d)}),$$\nwhere the $\\zeta_j$s are the primitive $d$th roots of unity, then the\nequation $$\\prod_{d|n,\\,\\,d>0}\\!\\Phi_d(x) = x^n\\!-\\!1$$ is true, because\neach $n$th root of unity is also a $d$th root of unity for one and only\none positive divisor of $n$. The cyclotomic factor polynomials\n$\\Phi_d(x)$ have integer coefficients and are . Thus the number of them\nis same as the number $\\tau(n)$ of positive divisors of $n$.\n\nFor illustrating the proof, let $n = 6$ (divisors 1, 2, 3, 6); think the\nsixth roots of unity: $\\zeta^0$, $\\zeta^1$, $\\zeta^2$, $\\zeta^3$,\n$\\zeta^4$, $\\zeta^5$ (where\n$\\zeta = e^{i\\pi/3} = \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$). From them, $\\zeta^0 = 1$\nis the primitive 1st root, $\\zeta^3$ the primitive 2nd root, $\\zeta^2$\nand $\\zeta^4$ the primitive 3rd roots, $\\zeta^1$ and $\\zeta^5$ the\nprimitive 6th roots of unity.",
