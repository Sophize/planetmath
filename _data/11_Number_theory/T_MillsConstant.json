  "definition": "Find the smallest real positive number $M$ such that\n$\\lfloor M^{3^n} \\rfloor$ is a prime number for any integer $n > 0$.\nThis is [*Mills\u2019 constant*]{}. Assuming that the Riemann hypothesis is\ntrue, the constant\u2019s value would be approximately\n1.3063778838630806904686144926026 (see A051021 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS).\nAccording to Caldwell and Cheng, Mills\u2019 original paper \u201ccontained no\nnumerics,\u201d it only proved the existence of such a number; moreover it\nreferred to $\\lfloor M^{c^n} \\rfloor$, and it is those who hunt for the\nspecific value of $M$ who often choose $c = 3$. Armed with these\nassignments and assumptions (including certain probable primes),\nCaldwell and Cheng computed almost seven thousand base 10 digits of\nMills\u2019 constant. The first few primes generated by Mills\u2019 constant would\nbe 2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, etc. (listed in A051254).\n\n[2]{} C. K. Caldwell & Y.
