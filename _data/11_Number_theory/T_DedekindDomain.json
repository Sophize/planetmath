  "definition": "A [*Dedekind domain*]{} is a commutative integral domain $R$ for which:\n\n-   Every ideal in $R$ is finitely generated.\n\n-   Every nonzero prime ideal is a maximal ideal.\n\n-   The domain $R$ is integrally closed in its field of fractions.\n\nIt is worth noting that the second clause above implies that the maximal\nlength of a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals is 1, so the Krull\ndimension of any Dedekind domain is at most 1. In particular, the affine\nring of an algebraic set is a Dedekind domain if and only if the set is\nnormal, irreducible, and 1-dimensional.\n\nEvery Dedekind domain is a noetherian ring.\n\nIf $K$ is a number field, then $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the ring of algebraic\nintegers of $K$, is a Dedekind domain.",
