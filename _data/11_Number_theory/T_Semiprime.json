  "definition": "A composite number which is the product of two (possibly equal) primes\nis called *semiprime*. Such numbers are sometimes also called 2-*almost\nprimes*. For example:\n\n-   1 is not a semiprime because it is not a composite number or a\n    prime,\n\n-   2 is not a semiprime, as it is a prime,\n\n-   4 is a semiprime, since $4 = 2\\cdot 2$,\n\n-   8 is not a semiprime, since it is a product of three primes\n    ($8 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2$),\n\n-   2003 is not a semiprime, as it is a prime,\n\n-   2005 is a semiprime, since $2005 = 5\\cdot 401$,\n\n-   2007 is not a semiprime, since it is a product of three primes\n    ($2007 = 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 223$).\n\nThe first few semiprimes are\n$4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 49, 51, 55, 57, 58, 62, \\ldots$\n( ). The Moebius function $\\mu(n)$ for semiprimes can be only equal to 0\nor 1. If we form an integer sequence of values of $\\mu(n)$ for\nsemiprimes we get a binary sequence:\n$0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \\ldots$.\n( ).\n\nAll the squares of primes are also semiprimes. The first few squares of\nprimes are then\n$4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529, 841, 961, 1369, 1681, 1849, 2209, 2809, 3481, 3721, 4489, 5041, \\ldots$.\n( ). The Moebius function $\\mu(n)$ for the squares of primes is always\nequal to 0 as it is equal to 0 for all squares.",
