  "argumentText": "Let $F\\subset K$ be a field extension with $K$ an algebraically closed\nfield. Let $x\\in K$ be transcendental over $F$. Then for any natural\nnumber $n\\geq 1$, the element $x^{1/n}\\in K$ is also transcendental over\n$F$.\n\nSuppose $x$ is transcendental over a field $F$, and assume for a\ncontradiction that $x^{1/n}$ is algebraic over $F$. Thus, there is a\npolynomial $P(y)\\in F[y]$ such that $P(x^{1/n})=0$ (note that the\npolynomial $y^n-x$ is [*not*]{} a polynomial with coefficients in $F$,\nso $P(y)$ might be more involved). Then the field\n$H=F(x^{1/n})\\subseteq K$ is a finite algebraic extension of $F$, and\nevery element of $H$ is algebraic over $K$. However $x\\in H$, so $x$ is\nalgebraic over $F$ which is a contradiction.",
