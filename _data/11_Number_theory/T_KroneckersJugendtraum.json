  "definition": "Kronecker\u2019s Jugendtraum (Jugendtraum is German for \u201cyouthful dream\u201d)\ndescribes a central problem in class field theory, to explicitly\ndescribe the abelian extensions of an arbitrary number field $K$ in of\nvalues of transcendental functions.\n\nClass field theory gives a solution to this problem in the case where\n$K=\\mathbb{Q}$, the field of rational numbers. Specifically, the\nKronecker-Weber theorem gives that any number field sits inside one of\nthe cyclotomic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ for some $n$. Refining this\nonly slightly gives that we can explicitly generate all abelian\nextensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$ by adjoining values of the transcendental\nfunction $e^{2\\pi iz}$ for certain points\n$z\\in {{\\mathbb}{Q}}/{{\\mathbb}{Z}}$.\n\nA slightly more complicated example is when $K$ is a quadratic imaginary\nextension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, in which case Kronecker\u2019s Jugendtraum has\nbeen solved by the theory of \u201ccomplex multiplication\u201d (see CM-field).\nThe specific transcendental functions which generate all these abelian\nextensions are the $j$-function (as in elliptic curves) and Weber\u2019s\n$w$-function.\n\nThough there are partial results in the cases of CM-fields or real\nquadratic fields, the problem is largely still , and earned great\nprestige by being included as Hilbert\u2019s twelfth problem.",
