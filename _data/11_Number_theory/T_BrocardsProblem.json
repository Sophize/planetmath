  "definition": "[*Brocard\u2019s problem*]{}, first posed by Henri Brocard in 1876, asks for\nfactorials that are one less than a square, that is, solutions to the\nequation $n! + 1 = m^2$. Only three solutions are known: $4! + 1 = 5^2$,\n$5! + 1 = 11^2$ and $7! + 1 = 71^2$. Srinivasa Ramanujan also pondered\nthe problem, in 1913. Erd\u0151s believed that there are no other solutions,\nand no more have been found for $n$ up to $10^9$.\n\n[1]{} P. Erd\u0151s, & R.
