  "definition": "A [*modulus*]{} for a number field $K$ is a formal product\n$$\\prod_{{\\mathfrak{p}}} {\\mathfrak{p}}^{n_{\\mathfrak{p}}}$$ where\n\n-   The product is taken over all finite primes and infinite primes of\n    $K$\n\n-   The exponents $n_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ are nonnegative integers\n\n-   All but finitely many of the $n_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ are zero\n\n-   For every real prime ${\\mathfrak{p}}$, the exponent\n    $n_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is either 0 or 1\n\n-   For every complex prime ${\\mathfrak{p}}$, the exponent\n    $n_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is 0\n\nA modulus can be written as a product of its finite part\n$$\\prod_{{\\mathfrak{p}}\\text{ finite}} {\\mathfrak{p}}^{n_{\\mathfrak{p}}}$$\nand its infinite part\n$$\\prod_{{\\mathfrak{p}}\\text{ real}} {\\mathfrak{p}}^{n_{\\mathfrak{p}}},$$\nwith the finite part equal to some ideal in the ring of integers\n$\\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$, and the infinite part equal to the product of\nsome subcollection of the real primes of $K$.",
