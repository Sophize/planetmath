  "statement": "Throughout this entry we will use the following corollary to the\nexistence of the Hilbert class field (see the parent entry, unramified\nextensions and class number divisibility for details of the proof).\n\nLet $K$ be a number field, $h_K$ is its class number and let $p$ be a\nprime. Then $K$ has an everywhere unramified Galois extension of degree\n$p$ if and only if $h_K$ is divisible by $p$.\n\nIn this entry we are concerned about the divisibility properties of\nclass numbers of number fields in extensions.\n\nLet $F/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields, let $h_F$ and $h_K$ be\ntheir respective class numbers and let $p$ be a prime number such that\n$p$ does not divide $[F:K]$, the degree of the extension. Then, if $p$\ndivides $h_K$, the class number of $F$, $h_F$, is also divisible by $p$.\n\nLet $F$, $K$ and $p$ be as in the statement of the theorem. Assume that\n$p| h_K$. Thus, by the corollary above, there exists an unramified\nGalois extension field $E$ of $K$ of degree $p$. Notice that the fact\nthat $p$ does not divide the degree of the extension $F/K$ implies that\n$F\\cap E=K$. In particular, the compositum $FE$ is a Galois extension of\n$F$ and\n$${\\operatorname{Gal}}(FE/F)\\cong {\\operatorname{Gal}}(E/E\\cap F)\\cong {\\operatorname{Gal}}(E/K).$$\nThus, the extension $FE/F$ is of degree $p$, Galois, and therefore\nabelian. By the corollary above, in order to prove the theorem it\nsuffices to show that the extension $FE/F$ is unramified. Suppose for a\ncontradiction that $\\mathcal{Q}_F$ is a prime ideal which ramifies in\nthe extension $FE/F$. Let $\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}$ be a prime lying above\n$\\mathcal{Q}_F$ and let $\\mathcal{Q}_K$ be a prime of $K$ such that\n$\\mathcal{Q}_F$ lies above it. Similarly, let $\\mathcal{Q}_E$ be a prime\nof $E$ lying above $\\mathcal{Q}_K$ and such that the prime\n$\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}$ lies above $\\mathcal{Q}_E$. For an arbitrary\nextension $A/B$, the ramification index of a prime $\\mathcal{Q}_A$ is\ndenoted by $e(\\mathcal{Q}_B|\\mathcal{Q}_A)$. Then, by the\nmultiplicativity of the ramification index in towers, we have:\n$$e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_K)=e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_F)\\cdot e(\\mathcal{Q}_{F}|\\mathcal{Q}_K)=e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_E)\\cdot e(\\mathcal{Q}_{E}|\\mathcal{Q}_K)$$\nSince we assumed that $\\mathcal{Q}_F$ is ramified in $EF/F$, and the\ndegree of the extension is $p$, we must have\n$e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_F)=p$. Therefore, by the equality above,\n$p$ divides\n$e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_E)\\cdot e(\\mathcal{Q}_{E}|\\mathcal{Q}_K)$.\nNotice that the extension $E/K$ is everywhere unramified, therefore\n$e(\\mathcal{Q}_E|\\mathcal{Q}_K)=1$. Also, $[EF:E]=[F:K]$ which, by\nhypothesis, is relatively prime to $p$. Thus\n$e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_E)$ is also relatively prime to $p$, and\nso, $p$ is not a divisor of\n$e(\\mathcal{Q}_{EF}|\\mathcal{Q}_E)\\cdot e(\\mathcal{Q}_{E}|\\mathcal{Q}_K)$,\nwhich leads to the desired contradiction, finishing the proof of the\ntheorem.\n\nAlso, read the entry extensions without unramified subextensions and\nclass number divisibility for a similar and more general result.",
