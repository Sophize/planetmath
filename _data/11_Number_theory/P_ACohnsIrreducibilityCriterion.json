If $P(n)$ is prime then $P(x)$ is\nin $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$.\n\nA proof is given in [@MRM].\n\nA. Cohn [@PZ] proved this theorem for the case $n=10$.\n\nThis special case of the above theorem is sketched as problem 128, Part\nVIII, in [@PZ].\n\n[0]{} George P\u00c3\u00b3lya, Gabor Szego, [*Problems and Theorems in Analysis\nII*]{}, Classics in Mathematics 1998.
