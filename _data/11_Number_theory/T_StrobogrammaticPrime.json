  "definition": "A [*strobogrammatic prime*]{} is a prime number that, given a base and\ngiven a set of glyphs, is a strobogrammatic number (it appears the same\nwhether viewed normally or upside down). In base 10, given a set of\nglyphs where 0, 1 and 8 are symmetrical around the horizontal axis, and\n6 and 9 are the same as each other upside down, (such as on the\nseven-segment display of a calculator), the first few strobogrammatic\nprimes are: 11, 101, 181, 619, 16091, 18181 (listed in A007597 of\nSloane\u2019s OEIS).\n\nIn binary, given a glyph for 1 consisting of a single line without hooks\nor serifs, all Mersenne primes are strobogrammatic primes. Palindromic\nprimes in binary are also strobogrammatic.\n\nIn base 10, dihedral primes that don\u2019t use 2 or 5 are also\nstrobogrammatic primes.",
