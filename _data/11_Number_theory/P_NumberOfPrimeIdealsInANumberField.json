  "statement": "**Theorem.** The ring of integers of an algebraic number field contains\ninfinitely many prime ideals.\\\n*Proof.* Let $\\mathcal{O}$ be the ring of integers of a number field. If\n$p$ is a rational prime number, then the principal ideal $(p)$ of\n$\\mathcal{O}$ does not coincide with $(1) = \\mathcal{O}$ and thus $(p)$\nhas a set of prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}$ as factors. Two different\n(positive) rational primes $p$ and $q$ satisfy\n$$\\gcd((p),\\,(q)) \\;=\\; (p,\\,q) \\;=\\; (1),$$ since there exist integers\n$x$ and $y$ such that $xp\\!+\\!yq = 1$ and consequently $1 \\in (p,\\,q)$.\nTherefore, the principal ideals $(p)$ and $(q)$ of $\\mathcal{O}$ have no\ncommon prime ideal factors. Because there are , also the corresponding\nprincipal ideals have infinitely many different prime ideal factors.",
