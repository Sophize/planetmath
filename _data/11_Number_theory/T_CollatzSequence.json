  "definition": "A [*Collatz sequence*]{} is a sequence formed by iteratively applying\nthe function defined for the Collatz problem to a given starting integer\n$n$, in which if $2|n$, $f(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$ and if not then\n$f(n) = 3n + 1$.\n\nFor example, the Collatz sequence starting with 47 goes: 47, 142, 71,\n214, 107, 322, 161, 484, 242, 121, 364, 182, 91, 274, 137, 412, 206,\n103, 310, 155, 466, 233, 700, 350, 175, 526, 263, 790, 395, 1186, 593,\n1780, 890, 445, 1336, 668, 334, 167, 502, 251, 754, 377, 1132, 566, 283,\n850, 425, 1276, 638, 319, 958, 479, 1438, 719, 2158, 1079, 3238, 1619,\n4858, 2429, 7288, 3644, 1822, 911, 2734, 1367, 4102, 2051, 6154, 3077,\n9232, 4616, 2308, 1154, 577, 1732, 866, 433, 1300, 650, 325, 976, 488,\n244, 122, 61, 184, 92, 46, 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5,\n16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\nIt is obvious that for a power of 2, $n = 2^x$, the Collatz sequence\nwill be $x$ long (not counting the starting number) and consist of the\nfirst $x$ integer powers of 2 in descending order:\n$2^{x - 1}, 2^{x - 2}, \\ldots, 2, 1$.\n\nFor other kinds of $n$ there are various formulas giving heuristic\nestimates of the length of the Collatz sequence of $n$ but no simple\nformula to give the exact value. The number of iterations needed to\nreach 1 for the first few $n$ are 1, 2, 8, 3, 6, 9, 17, 4, 20, 7, 15,\n10, 10, 18, 18, 5, 13, 21, 21, 8, 8, 16, 16, 11, 24, etc., listed in\nsequence A008908 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS. The number of iterations needed to\nreach a power of 2 for the first few $n$ are 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 4, 12, 0,\n15, 2, 10, 5, 5, 13, 13, 0, 8, 16, 16, 3, 1, 11, 11, 6, 19, 6, 107, 14,\n14, 14, 102, 0, 22, 9, 9, 17, 17, 17, 30, 4, 105, 2, 25, etc., which can\nbe calculated with the Mathematica command\n`Flatten[Table[Take[Select[Range[Length[Collatz[n]]], IntegerQ[1 / Log[Collatz[n][[#]], 2]] &], 1], {n, 100}]]`\n(the `Collatz[n]` command needs to be defined by the user; the program\nwill complain about division by zero but still give the desired\nresults).",
