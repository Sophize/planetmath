Assume that there is at\n    most one prime or archimedean place which ramifies in $F/K$. If\n    $h_F$ is divisible by $p$ then $h_K$ is also divisible by $p$.\\\n\n-   Let $F/{\\mathbb{Q}}$ be a Galois extension of the rational numbers\n    and assume that ${\\operatorname{Gal}}(F/{\\mathbb{Q}})$ is a\n    $p$-group and at most one place (finite or infinite) ramifies then\n    $h_F$ is not divisible by $p$.",
