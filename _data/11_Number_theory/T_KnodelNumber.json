  "definition": "The [*Kn\u00f6del numbers*]{} $K_n$ for a given positive integer $n$ are the\nset of composite integers $m > n$ such that any $b < m$ coprime to $m$\nsatisfies $b^{m - n} \\equiv 1 \\mod m$. The Carmichael numbers are $K_1$.\nThere are infinitely many Knodel number $K_n$ for a given $n$, something\nwhich was first proven only for $n > 2$. Erd\u0151s speculated that this was\nalso true for $n = 1$ but two decades passed before this was\nconclusively proved by Alford, Granville and Pomerance.\n\n[5]{} W. R. Alford, A. Granville, and C.
