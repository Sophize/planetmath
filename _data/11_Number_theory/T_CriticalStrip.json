  "definition": "The [*critical strip*]{} of the Riemann zeta function is\n$\\{ s \\in \\mathbb{C}: 0 \\le \\operatorname{Re}(s) \\le 1 \\}$. The zeroes\nof the Riemann zeta function outside of the critical strip are exactly\nthe set of all negative even integers. The location of the zeroes of the\nRiemann zeta function inside the critical strip is not totally known;\nabout these zeroes is crucial in analytic number theory and the of\nprimes. The Riemann hypothesis asserts that all zeroes of the Riemann\nzeta function that are in the critical strip lie on the line\n$\\operatorname{Re}(s)=\\frac{1}{2}$. This is all explained in more detail\nin the entry .\n\nIt is well known that no zeroes of the Riemann zeta function lie on\neither of the lines $\\operatorname{Re}(s)=0$ and\n$\\operatorname{Re}(s)=1$. (See for a proof.) Therefore, some people use\nthe \u201ccritical strip\u201d to refer to the\n$\\{ s \\in \\mathbb{C}: 0<\\operatorname{Re}(s)<1 \\}$. (Note that this is\nthe interior of the critical strip as defined above.) For example, this\nusage in the title of the entry formulae for zeta in the critical strip.",
