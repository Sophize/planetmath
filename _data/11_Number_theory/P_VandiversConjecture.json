  "statement": "Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)^+$, the maximal real subfield of the $p$-th\ncyclotomic field. Vandiver\u2019s conjecture states that $p$ does not divide\n$h_K$, the class number of $K$.\n\nFor comparison, see the entries on regular primes and irregular primes.\n\nA proof of Vandiver\u2019s conjecture would be a landmark in algebraic number\ntheory, as many theorems hinge on the assumption that this conjecture is\ntrue. For example, it is known that if Vandiver\u2019s conjecture holds, that\nthe $p$-rank of the ideal class group of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ equals\nthe number of Bernoulli numbers divisible by $p$ (a remarkable\nstrengthening of Herbrand\u2019s theorem).",
