[**543**]{} (2002)\n187-192.\n\nSee Section 7 of following paper in which the solution of a certain case\nof the conjecture (given in the latter qouted paper) is used to solve a\nproblem in group theory concerning the non-cyclic graph of a group. Also\nsee Proposition 7.6 of the folloiwng paper for an slightly special case\nof the conjecture which its solotion has some applications in group\ntheory.\n\nAlireza Abdollahi and A.
