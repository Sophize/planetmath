  "definition": "A [*random Fibonacci sequence*]{} has its initial terms defined as\n$F_0 = F_1 = 1$ but the sign (plus or minus) in recurrence relation\n$F_n = F_{n - 1} \\pm F_{n - 2}$ is chosen randomly with either sign\nhaving an equal probability of being chosen. For example, if the random\nselection gives two minuses followed by three plusses, another minus,\netc., the resulting random Fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 0, $-1$, $-1$,\n$-2$, $-3$, $-1$, etc. The scenarios that either plus or minus is always\nconsistently chosen leads to the standard Fibonacci sequence, though in\nthe latter case with all values (except the first two) multiplied by\n$-1$.\n\nIn 2000, Divakar Viswanath proved that for most random Fibonacci\nsequences (with a few notable exceptions),\n$|F_n| \\approx \\lfloor V^n \\rfloor$, where $|x|$ is the absolute value\nfunction, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the floor function and $V$ is the\nconstant 1.13198824... now known as Viswanath\u2019s constant. This does not\nhold true for the standard Fibonacci sequence nor for random Fibonacci\nsequences for which all $|F_n| < 2$ (such as 1, 1, 0, 1, $-1$, 0, $-1$,\n1, 0, 1, $-1$, generated by consistently alternating plus and minus at\neach turn), but for almost all other possible random Fibonacci\nsequences, \u201cyou can safely bet your life on the fact that for your\nsequence, the bigger $N$ is, the closer the absolute value of the $N$th\nnumber gets to the $N$th power of 1.13198824...\u201d (Devlin, 1999) In terms\nof limits, $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{|F_n|} = V.$$\n\n[2]{} Keith Devlin, \u201cDevlin\u2019s Angle: New Mathematical Constant\nDiscovered\u201d March 1999 [*MAA Online*]{} Divakar Viswanath \u201cRandom\nFibonacci sequences and the number 1.13198824....\u201d [*Mathematics of\nComputation*]{} [**69**]{} 231 (2000): 1131 - 1155",
