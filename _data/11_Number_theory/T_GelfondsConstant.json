  "definition": "[*Gelfond\u2019s constant*]{} $e^\\pi$ was one of the first numbers to be\nproven to be transcendental by appying Gelfond\u2019s theorem. However,\nnaming the constant after Gelfond comes from Eric Weisstein, with many\npeople preferring to refer to it simply as $e$ to the power of $\\pi$.\n\nIts value in base 10 is approximately\n23.1406926327792690057290863679485473802661062426. Its continued\nfraction representation is neither terminating nor periodic, and begins\n$$23 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{9 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\, \\cdots}}}$$",
