  "definition": "The *content of a polynomial* $f$ may be defined in any polynomial ring\n$R[x]$ over a commutative ring $R$ as the ideal of $R$ generated by the\ncoefficients of the polynomial. It is denoted by\n$\\operatorname{cont}(f)$ or $c(f)$. Coefficient module is a little more\ngeneral concept.\\\nIf $R$ is a and $f,\\,g \\in R[x]$, the Gauss lemma I implies [^1] that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nc(fg) \\;=\\; c(f)c(g).\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFor an arbitrary commutative ring $R$, there is only the containment\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nc(fg) \\;\\subseteq\\; c(f)c(g)\\end{aligned}$$ (cf. product of finitely\ngenerated ideals). The ideal $c(fg)$ is called the *Gaussian ideal of*\nthe polynomials $f$ and $g$. The polynomial $f$ in $R[x]$ is a , if (2)\nbecomes the equality (1) for all polynomials $g$ in the ring $R[x]$. The\nring $R$ is a *Gaussian ring*, if all polynomials in $R[x]$ are .\\\nIt\u2019s quite interessant, that the equation (1) multiplied by the power\n$[c(f)]^n$, where $n$ is the degree of the other polynomial $g$, however\nis true in any commutative ring $R$, thus replacing the containment (2):\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n[c(f)]^nc(fg) \\;=\\; [c(f)]^{n+1}c(g).\\end{aligned}$$ This result is\ncalled the *Hilfssatz von Dedekind\u2013Mertens*, i.e. the Dedekind\u2013Mertens\nlemma. A generalised form of it is in the entry .\n\n[8]{} : \u201cGaussian ideals and the Dedekind\u2013Mertens lemma\u201d in J\u00fcrgen\nHerzog & Gaetana Restuccia (eds.): [*Geometric and combinatorial aspects\nof commutative algebra*]{}. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York (2001).\n\n[^1]: In a UFD, one can use as contents of $f$ and $g$ the $a$ and $b$\n    of the coefficients of these polynomials, when one has\n    $f(x) = af_1(x)$, $g(x) = bg_1(x)$ with $f_1(x)$ and $g_1(x)$\n    primitive polynomials. Then $f(x)g(x) = abf_1(x)g_1(x)$, and since\n    also $f_1g_1$ is a primitive polynomial, we see that\n    $c(fg) = ab = c(f)c(g)$.",
