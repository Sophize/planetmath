  "definition": "A cusp form is a modular form whose first coefficient in any expansion\naround a cusp is zero. Another more general way to define cusp forms is\nto consider the forms orthogonal to Eisenstein series with respect to\nthe Petersson scalar product.\n\nThe Weierstrass $\\Delta$ function, also called modular discriminant is a\nweight 12 cusp form for the full modular group\n${\\textrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb Z)}$\n$$\\Delta(z)=q\\underset{n=1}{\\overset{\\infty}{\\prod}}(1-q^n)^{24}$$\n\nThe vector space of weight $k$ cusp forms for the full modular group is\nfinite dimensionnal and non-trivial for $k$ integral greater than 12 and\nnot 14.",
