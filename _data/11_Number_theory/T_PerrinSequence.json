  "definition": "Construct a recurrence relation with initial terms $a_0 = 3$, $a_1 = 0$,\n$a_2 = 2$ and $a_n = a_{n - 3} + a_{n - 2}$ for $n > 2$. The first few\nterms of the sequence defined by this recurrence relation are: 3, 0, 2,\n3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 22, 29, 39, 51, 68, 90, 119, 158, 209, 277,\n367 (listed in A001608 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS). This is the [*Perrin\nsequence*]{}, sometimes called the [*Ondrej Such sequence*]{}. Its\ngenerating function is $$G(a(n);x)=\\frac{3-x^2}{1-x^2-x^3}.$$ A number\nin the Perrin sequence is called a *Perrin number*.\n\nIt has been observed that if $n|a_n$, then $n$ is a prime number, at\nleast among the first hundred thousand integers or so. However, the\nsquare of 521 passes this test.\n\nThe $n$th Perrin number asymptotically matches the $n$th power of the\nplastic constant.\n\n[1]{} W. W. Adams and D. Shanks, \u201cStrong primality tests that are not\nsufficient\" [*Math. Comp.*]{} [**39**]{}, pp. 255 - 300 (1982)",
