  "definition": "Given a sequence of positive real numbers $(a_n)_{n \\ge 1}$, with $a_0$\nany real number. Consider the sequence\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nc_1&=a_0+\\sfrac{1}{a_1}\\\\\nc_2&=a_0+\\sfrac{1}{a_1+\\sfrac{1}{a_2}}\\\\\nc_3&=a_0+\\sfrac{1}{a_1+\\sfrac{1}{a_2+\\sfrac{1}{a_3}}}\\\\\nc_4&=\\ldots\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe limit $c$ of this sequence, if it exists, is called the value or\nlimit of the *infinite continued fraction* with *convergents* $(c_n)$,\nand is denoted by\n$$a_0 + \\sfrac{1}{a_1 + \\sfrac{1}{a_2 + \\sfrac{1}{a_3 + \\ldots}}}$$ or\nby\n$$a_{0} + \\frac{1}{a_{1} + }\\frac{1}{a_{2} + }\\frac{1}{a_{3} + }\\ldots$$\n\nIn the same way, a finite sequence $$(a_n)_{1\\le n\\le k}$$ defines a\nfinite sequence $$(c_n)_{1\\le n\\le k}\\;.$$ We then speak of a finite\ncontinued fraction with value $c_k$.\n\nAn archaic word for a continued fraction is *anthyphairetic ratio*.\n\nIf the denominators $a_n$ are all (positive) integers, we speak of a\n*simple* continued fraction. We then use the notation\n$q = \\langle a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3,\\ldots \\rangle $ or, in the finite case,\n$q = \\langle a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots , a_n \\rangle \\;.$\n\nIt is not hard to prove that any irrational number $c$ is the value of a\nunique infinite simple continued fraction. Moreover, if $c_n$ denotes\nits $n$th convergent, then $c-c_n$ is an alternating sequence and\n$|c - c_n|$ is decreasing (as well as convergent to zero). Also, the\nvalue of an infinite simple continued fraction is perforce irrational.\n\nAny rational number is the value of two and only two finite continued\nfractions; in one of them, the last denominator is 1. E.g.\n$$\\frac{43}{30} = \\langle 1;2,3,4 \\rangle = \\langle 1;2,3,3,1 \\rangle \\;.$$\n\nThese two conditions on a real number $c$ are equivalent:\n\n1\\. $c$ is a root of an irreducible quadratic polynomial with integer\ncoefficients.\n\n2\\. $c$ is irrational and its simple continued fraction is \u201ceventually\nperiodic\u201d; i.e. $$c=\\langle a_0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots\\rangle$$ and, for some\ninteger $m$ and some integer $k>0$, we have $a_n=a_{n+k}$ for all\n$n\\ge m$.\n\nFor example, consider the quadratic equation for the golden ratio:\n$$x^2 = x + 1$$ or equivalently $$x = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\;.$$ We get\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx & = & 1 + \\sfrac{1}{1+\\sfrac{1}{x}} \\\\\n  & = & 1 + \\sfrac{1}{1+\\sfrac{1}{1+\\sfrac{1}{x}}}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nand so on. If $x > 0$, we therefore expect\n$$x = \\langle 1; 1, 1, 1, \\ldots \\rangle$$ which indeed can be proved.\nAs an exercise, you might like to look for a continued fraction\nexpansion of the *other* solution of $x^2 = x + 1$.\n\nAlthough $e$ is transcendental, there is a surprising pattern in its\nsimple continued fraction expansion.\n$$e=\\langle 2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10, \\ldots \\rangle$$\nNo pattern is apparent in the expansions some other well-known\ntranscendental constants, such as $\\pi$ and Ap\u00e9ry\u2019s constant $\\zeta(3)$.\n\nOwing to a kinship with the Euclidean division algorithm, continued\nfractions arise naturally in number theory. An interesting example is\nthe Pell diophantine equation $$x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$$ where $D$ is a\nnonsquare integer $> 0$. It turns out that if $(x, y)$ is any solution\nof the Pell equation other than $(\\pm 1, 0)$, then $| \\frac{x}{y}|$ is a\nconvergent to $\\sqrt{D}$.\n\n$\\frac{22}{7}$ and $\\frac{355}{113}$ are well-known rational\napproximations to $\\pi$, and indeed both are convergents to $\\pi$:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n3.14159265\\ldots & = & \\pi = \\langle 3;7,15,1,292,...\\rangle \\\\\n3.14285714\\ldots & = & \\frac{22}{7} = \\langle 3;7\\rangle \\\\\n3.14159292\\ldots & = & \\frac{355}{113} = \\langle 3;7,15,1\\rangle=\\langle 3;7,16\\rangle\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFor one more example, the distribution of leap years in the 4800-month\ncycle of the Gregorian calendar can be interpreted (loosely speaking) in\nterms of the continued fraction expansion of the number of days in a\nsolar year.",
