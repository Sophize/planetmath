  "definition": "An integer $n$ that in a given base $b$ lacks a digitaddition generator.\n\nConsider, for example, the integer 41 in base 10. It can be expressed as\n34 + 3 + 4. For 42, however, there is no such digitaddition, hence it is\na self number.\n\nIf $2|b$, all odd $n < b$ will be self numbers.\n\nThough self numbers form a small proportion of most ranges of $2b$\nconsecutive integers, there are infinitely many of them: The recurrence\nrelation $S_i = (b - 2)b^{i - 1} + S_{i - 1} + (b - 2)$ (with\n$S_1 = b - 1$ if $2|b$ and $S_1 = b - 2$ otherwise) will give an\nincomplete though infinite list of self numbers.\n\nReference\n\nKaprekar, D.
