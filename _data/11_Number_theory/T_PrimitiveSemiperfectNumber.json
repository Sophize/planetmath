  "definition": "Parse the sequence of semiperfect numbers in ascending order, striking\nout any numbers that are divisible by any smaller number in the\nsequence. A number that remains after this process is then called a\n*primitive semiperfect number* or *primitive pseudoperfect number*. Put\nanother way, none of the divisors of a primitive semiperfect number are\nthemselves semiperfect. The first few primitive semiperfect numbers are\n6, 20, 28, 88, 104, 272, 304, 350, listed in A6036 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS.\n\nThe list of the largest prime factors of each of the primitive\nsemiperfect numbers gives the list of prime numbers almost in order but\nwith many duplicates interspersed.\n\nThe smallest odd primitive semiperfect number is 945, which is also the\nsmallest odd abundant number.",
