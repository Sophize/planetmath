  "statement": "[**Conjecture.**]{} (Hardy & Littlewood) There are infinitely many prime\nquadruplets.\n\nAs with twin primes, prime quadruplets generally become scarcer the\nhigher one looks for them with the aid of the computer, yet they also\ndisplay the same unevenness of distribution: there is only one prime\nquadruplet between 40000 and 50000, yet there are three between 70000\nand 80000. While Euclid proved long ago that there are infinitely many\nprimes, it is still not known whether there are also infinitely many\nprime quadruplets.\n\nThe question is related to the twin prime conjecture: proving the prime\nquadruplet conjecture would automatically prove the twin prime\nconjecture as well. However, disproving the prime quadruplet conjecture\nmight not necessarily disprove the twin prime conjecture as well.\n\nHardy and Littlewood stated their conjecture in more general terms as\nthe prime $k$-tuple conjecture, with the case of the prime quadruplets\nbeing for $k = 4$.",
