  "definition": "Basic construction\n==================\n\nFor any prime $p$, the [*$p$\u2013adic integers*]{} is the ring obtained by\ntaking the completion of the integers ${\\mathbb{Z}}$ with respect to the\nmetric induced by the norm $$\\label{valuation}\n|x| := \\frac{1}{p^{\\nu_p(x)}},\\ \\ x \\in {\\mathbb{Z}},$$ where $\\nu_p(x)$\ndenotes the largest integer $e$ such that $p^e$ divides $x$. The induced\nmetric $d(x,y) := |x-y|$ is called the [*$p$\u2013adic metric*]{} on\n${\\mathbb{Z}}$. The ring of $p$\u2013adic integers is usually denoted by\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_p$, and its fraction field by ${\\mathbb{Q}}_p$.\n\nProfinite viewpoint\n===================\n\nThe ring ${\\mathbb{Z}}_p$ of $p$\u2013adic integers can also be constructed\nby taking the inverse limit\n$${\\mathbb{Z}}_p := {\\,\\underset{\\longleftarrow}{\\lim}\\,}{\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n{\\mathbb{Z}}$$\nover the inverse system\n$\\cdots \\to {\\mathbb{Z}}/p^2{\\mathbb{Z}}\\to {\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}\\to 0$\nconsisting of the rings ${\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n{\\mathbb{Z}}$, for all\n$n \\geq 0$, with the projection maps defined to be the unique maps such\nthat the diagram $$\\xymatrix{\n& {\\mathbb{Z}}\\ar[dl] \\ar[dr]\\\\\n{\\mathbb{Z}}/p^{n+1}{\\mathbb{Z}}\\ar[rr] & & {\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n{\\mathbb{Z}}}$$\ncommutes. An algebraic and topological isomorphism between the two\nconstructions is obtained by taking the coordinatewise projection map\n${\\mathbb{Z}}\\to {\\,\\underset{\\longleftarrow}{\\lim}\\,}{\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n{\\mathbb{Z}}$,\nextended to the completion of ${\\mathbb{Z}}$ under the $p$\u2013adic metric.\n\nThis alternate characterization shows that ${\\mathbb{Z}}_p$ is compact,\nsince it is a closed subspace of the space\n$$\\prod_{n \\geq 0} {\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n{\\mathbb{Z}}$$ which is an infinite\nproduct of finite topological spaces and hence compact under the product\ntopology.\n\nGeneralizations\n===============\n\nIf we interpret the prime $p$ as an equivalence class of valuations on\n${\\mathbb{Q}}$, then the field ${\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ is simply the completion\nof the topological field ${\\mathbb{Q}}$ with respect to the metric\ninduced by any member valuation of $p$ (indeed, the valuation defined in\nEquation\u00a0, extended to ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, may serve as the representative).\nThis notion easily generalizes to other fields and valuations; namely,\nif $K$ is any field, and ${\\mathfrak{p}}$ is any prime of $K$, then the\n${\\mathfrak{p}}$\u2013adic field $K_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is defined to be the\ncompletion of $K$ with respect to any valuation in ${\\mathfrak{p}}$. The\nanalogue of the $p$\u2013adic integers in this case can be obtained by taking\nthe subset (and subring) of $K_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ consisting of all\nelements of absolute value less than or equal to $1$, which is well\ndefined independent of the choice of valuation representing\n${\\mathfrak{p}}$.\n\nIn the special case where $K$ is a number field, the\n${\\mathfrak{p}}$\u2013adic ring $K_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is always a finite\nextension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ whenever ${\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a finite\nprime, and is always equal to either $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$\nwhenever ${\\mathfrak{p}}$ is an infinite prime.",
