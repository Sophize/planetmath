  "definition": "The *square root of 5* is an irrational number involved in the formula\nfor the golden ratio. It is also used in statistics when dealing with\n5-business day weeks. Its decimal expansion begins\n2.2360679774997896964, see in Sloane\u2019s OEIS. Its simple continued\nfraction is 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ... One formula\nfor the square root of 5 involves some of the same numbers as in Euler\u2019s\nidentity (but with a 2 instead of the 1): $e^{i\\pi}+2\\phi$. The square\nroot of 5 modulo a prime number is employed in some ECM algorithms.\n\nA rectangle with unit height and $\\sqrt{5}$ width can be split into two\ngolden rectangles of the same size and a square, or into two golden\nrectangles of different sizes.\n\nThe conjecture stating \u201cthat any abelian surface with RM by\n$Q(\\sqrt{5})$ is isogenous to a simple factor of the Jacobian of a\nmodular curve $X_0(N)$ for some $N$\u201d still stands. John Wilson has\nproduced equations for curves of genus 2 with Jacobians of the specified\nRM.\n\n[1]{} Francois Morain. [*Primality Proving Using Elliptic Curves: An\nUpdate*]{}.
