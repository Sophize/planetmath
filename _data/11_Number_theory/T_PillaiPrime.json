These are listed in A063980 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS.\nSarinya Intaraprasert proved that there are infinitely many Pillai\nprimes. The first few are 23, 29, 59, 61, 67, 71, 79, 83, 109, 137, 139,\n149, 193, \u2026\n\n[2]{} R. K. Guy, [*Unsolved Problems in Number Theory*]{} New York:\nSpringer-Verlag 2004: A2",
