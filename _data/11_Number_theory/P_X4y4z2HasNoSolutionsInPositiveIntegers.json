  "statement": "We know (see example of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem) that the sum of two\nfourth powers can never be a square unless all are zero. This article\nshows that the difference of two fourth powers can never be a square\nunless at least one of the numbers is zero. Fermat proved this fact as\npart of his proof that the area of a right triangle with integral sides\nis never a square; see the corollary below. The proof of the main\ntheorem is a great example of the method of infinite descent.\n\n$$x^4-y^4=z^2$$ has no solutions in positive integers.\n\nSuppose the equation has a solution in positive integers, and choose a\nsolution that minimizes $x^2+y^2$. Note that $x,y$, and $z$ are pairwise\ncoprime, since otherwise we could divide out by their common divisor to\nget a smaller solution. Thus $$z^2 + (y^2)^2 = (x^2)^2$$ so that\n$z, y^2, x^2$ form a pythagorean triple. There are thus positive\nintegers $p,q$ of opposite parity (and coprime since $x, y$, and $z$\nare) such that $x^2 = p^2+q^2$ and either $y^2 = p^2-q^2$ or\n$y^2 = 2pq$.\n\nFactoring the original equation, we get $$(x^2-y^2)(x^2+y^2)=z^2$$ If\n$y^2 = p^2-q^2$, then $(xy)^2 = p^4-q^4$, and clearly\n$p^2+q^2 = x^2 < x^2+y^2$, so we have found a solution smaller than the\nassumed minimal solution.\n\nAssume therefore that $y^2 = 2pq$. Now, $x^2 = p^2+q^2$; we may assume\nby relabeling if necessary that $q$ is even and $p$ odd. Then $p, q, x$\nare pairwise coprime and form a pythagorean triple; thus there are\n$P>Q>0$ of opposite parity and coprime such that\n$$q = 2PQ,\\quad p=P^2-Q^2,\\quad x=P^2+Q^2$$ Then\n$$PQ(P^2-Q^2) = \\frac{1}{2}pq = \\frac{y^2}{4}$$ is a square; it follows\nthat $P, Q$, and $P^2-Q^2$ are all (nonzero) squares since they are\npairwise coprime. Write $$P = R^2,\\quad Q=S^2,\\quad P^2-Q^2=T^2$$ for\npositive integers $R,S,T$. Then $T^2=R^4-S^4$, and\n$$R^2+S^2 = P+Q < (P+Q)(PQ)(P-Q) = \\frac{1}{2}pq = \\frac{y^2}{4}\\leq y^2 < x^2+y^2$$\nWe have thus found a smaller solution in positive integers,\ncontradicting the hypothesis.\n\nNo right triangle with integral sides has area that is an integral\nsquare.\n\nSuppose $x,y,z$ is a right triangle with $z$ the hypotenuse, and let\n$d=\\gcd(x,y,z)$. Either $x/d$ or $y/d$ is even; by relabeling if\nnecessary, assume $x/d$ is even. Then we can choose relatively prime\nintegers $p,q$ with $p>q$ and of opposite parity such that\n$$\\begin{gathered}\nx=(2pq)d\\\\\ny=(p^2-q^2)d\\\\\nz=(p^2+q^2)d\\end{gathered}$$\n\nIf the triangle\u2019s area is to be a square, then\n$$\\frac{1}{2}xy=pq(p^2-q^2)d^2$$ must be a square, and thus\n$pq(p^2-q^2)$ must be a square. Since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, it\nfollows that $p$, $q$, and $p^2-q^2$ are all squares, and thus that\n$p^2-q^2$ is the difference of two fourth powers. But then\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}xy}{pqd^2}=p^2-q^2$$ must also be a square. Since\nboth $p$ and $q$ are squares, this is impossible by the theorem.",
