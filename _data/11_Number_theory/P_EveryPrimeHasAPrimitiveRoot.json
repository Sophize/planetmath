  "statement": "Let $p$ be a prime. Recall that an integer $g$ is said to be a primitive\nroot for $p$ (or more concretely for\n$({\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times$) if the multiplicative order of\n$g$ modulo $p$ is $\\phi(p)=p-1$. In other words, $g$ is a generator of\nthe cyclic group $({\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times$, i.e.\n$$({\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times =\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,p-1\\}= \\{ 1, g, g^2,\\ldots,g^{p-2}\\}.$$\nBefore we go into the proof of the main theorem, we define the term\n\u201cleast universal exponent\u201d and prove a lemma.\n\nLet $N>2$ be a natural number. We say that $n$ is the [**least universal\nexponent**]{} for ${\\mathbb{Z}}/N{\\mathbb{Z}}$ if $a^n\\equiv 1\\mod N$\nfor all $a\\in ({\\mathbb{Z}}/N{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times$ and $n$ is the least\npositive integer with this property.\n\nIt follows from Euler\u2019s theorem that the least universal exponent $n$ of\n${\\mathbb{Z}}/N{\\mathbb{Z}}$ is less or equal to the value of Euler\u2019s\nphi function $\\phi(n)$, and in fact, the least universal exponent should\ndivide $\\phi(n)$.\n\nLet $p$ be a prime and let $n$ be the least universal exponent of\n${\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$. Then there is a number\n$a\\in ({\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times$ whose order is precisely $n$.\n\nIn this proof we will use the properties of the multiplicative order of\nan integer. We shall prove that (a) the least universal exponent is the\nleast common multiple of all the orders of all the elements of\n$({\\mathbb{Z}}/N{\\mathbb{Z}})^\\times$, and (b) there is an element whose\norder is exactly the least common multiple. In order to show (a) and\n(b), it suffices to show that if $a$ and $b$ have orders\n${\\operatorname{ord}}(a)=h$ and ${\\operatorname{ord}}(b)=k$ then there\nis an element $c$ whose order is\n${\\operatorname{ord}}(c)={\\operatorname{lcm}}(h,k)$. This is clear: if\n$q$ is a prime and $q^i$ divides $h={\\operatorname{ord}}(a)$ then, there\nis an element whose order is $p^i$ (namely $a^{h/q^i}$ has such order);\nand if $h'={\\operatorname{ord}}(c)$ and $k'={\\operatorname{ord}}(d)$ are\nrelatively prime then ${\\operatorname{ord}}(cd)=h'k'$. Finally, suppose\nthat ${\\operatorname{lcm}}(h,k)=q_1^{i_1}\\cdots q_t^{i_t}$, for some\ndistinct primes $q_1,\\ldots, q_t$ and positive integers\n$i_1,\\ldots,i_t$. Then, each $q_j^{i_j}$ divides either $h$ or $k$ and\nthere is an element $c_j$ of order exactly $q_j^{i_j}$. Thus, the\nelement $c=c_1\\cdots c_t$ has exact order ${\\operatorname{lcm}}(h,k)$.\n\nEvery prime $p$ has a primitive root.\n\nThe following proof is due to Legendre.\n\nIf $p=2$ then $g=1$ is a primitive root. Let us assume that $p>2$ is\nprime and let $n$ be the least universal exponent for $p$, i.e. $n$ is\nthe smallest positive integer such that $x^n\\equiv 1 \\mod p$, for all\nnon-zero $x\\in {\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$. Notice that, in particular\nby the Lemma, there is some element $g\\in {\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$\nsuch that $g^n\\equiv 1$ but $g^m\\neq 1 \\mod p$ for any $m<n$, i.e. the\nmultiplicative order of $g$ is precisely $n$. Also, notice that by\nFermat\u2019s little theorem, $n\\leq p-1$.\n\nNow, the polynomial $f(x)=x^n-1$ has at most $n$ roots over the field\n${\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$ (see ), and $f(x)\\equiv 0 \\mod p$ for all\nnon-zero $x \\mod p$. Thus $n\\geq p-1$. Hence, $n=p-1$ and $g$ is of\nexact order $p-1$, therefore $g$ is a primitive root.",
