  "definition": "108 is a Belgian-0 number because if we start a sequence with 0 with\nrecurring differences of 1, 0 and 8 (digits of the number), 108 is in\nthat sequence.The sequence is 1, 1, 9, 10, 10, 18, 19, 19, 27, 28, 28,\n36, 37, 37, 45, 46, 46, 54, 55, 55, 63, 64, 64, 72, 73, 73, 81, 82, 82,\n90, 91, 91, 99, 100, 100, 108.Similarly a number of the form abcd for\nexample is called as a Belgian-n number if it belongs to the sequence\nstarting with n and having reccuring differences of a, b, c, d ... The\nfirst few Belgian-0 numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,\n12, 13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24 ... (Sequence A106039 of OEIS). The first\nfew Belgian-1 numbers are 1, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 23, 41, 43, 56, 58\n... (Sequence A106439 of OEIS). The first few Belgian-2 numbers are 4,\n10, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 31, 32, 37, 40, 47 ... (Sequence\nA106331 of OEIS). The first few Belgian-3 numbers are 3, 10, 11, 12, 14,\n15, 21, 23, 30 ... (Sequence A106596 of OEIS). The first few Belgian-4\nnumbers are 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 25 ... (Sequence A106331 of\nOEIS). All Harshad numbers are Belgian-0 numbers. For all k, the number\nof k-Belgian numbers are infinite. They have a positive density. Every\npositive integer is a Belgian-k number for some k.\n\nSelf-Belgian numbers are of two types. Self-Belgian number of type 1 is\na number whose initial digit is \u2019a\u2019 and is an a-Belgian number. For\nexample 68 begins with 6 and is a 6-Belgian number. The self-Belgian\nnumbers of type 1 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17,\n20, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34 ... (Sequence A107062 of OEIS). There are\ninfinitely meny Self-Belgian numbers of type 1. Self Belgian numbers of\ntype two are the Self-Belgian numbers of type 1 which fully show all\ntheir digits at the starting of the sequence. For example, 61 is a\nSelf-Belgian number of type 2 as its sequence is 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26,\n27, 33, 34, 40, 41, 47, 48, 54, 55 and 61, which begins with digits 6\nand 1. The Self-Belgian numbers of type 2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n61, 71, 918, 3612, 5101, 8161, 12481, 51011 ... (Sequence A107070 of\nOEIS).",
