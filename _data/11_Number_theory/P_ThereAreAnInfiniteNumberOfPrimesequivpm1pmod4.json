But $N$ is not divisible by any prime less than\nor equal to $p$, so must be divisible by some prime congruent to\n$3\\pmod 4$ that exceeds $p$.\n\n\\[thm:two\\]There are an infinite number of primes congruent to\n$1\\pmod 4$.\n\nGiven $N>1$, we find a prime $p>N$ with $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$. Let $p$ be\nthe smallest (odd) prime factor of $(N!)^2+1$; note that $p>N$. Now\n$$(N!)^2\\equiv -1\\pmod p$$ and therefore\n$$(N!)^{p-1}\\equiv (-1)^{(p-1)/2}\\pmod p.$$ By Fermat\u2019s little theorem,\n$(N!)^{p-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, so we have\n$$(-1)^{(p-1)/2}\\equiv 1\\pmod p$$ The left-hand side cannot be -1, since\nthen $0\\equiv 2\\pmod p$. Thus $(-1)^{(p-1)/2}=1$ and it follows that\n$p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$.\n\nNote that the variant of Euclid\u2019s proof of the infinitude of primes used\nin the proof of Theorem \\[thm:one\\] does not work for Theorem\n\\[thm:two\\], since we cannot conclude that an integer $\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$\nhas a factor of the same kind.\n\n[10]{} Apostol,\u00a0T *Introduction to Analytic Number Theory*, Springer\n1976.",
