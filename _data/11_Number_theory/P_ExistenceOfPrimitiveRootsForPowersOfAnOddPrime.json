Then $p^k$ also has a primitive root,\nfor all $k\\geq 1$. Moreover:\n\n1.  If $g$ is a primitive root of $p$ and $g^{p-1}\\neq 1 \\mod p^2$ then\n    $g$ is a primitive root of $p^2$. Otherwise, if\n    $g^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\mod p^2$ then $g+p$ is a primitive root of $p^2$.\n\n2.  If $k\\geq 2$ and $h$ is a primitive root of $p^k$ then $h$ is a\n    primitive root of $p^{k+1}$.",
