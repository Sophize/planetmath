This has been verified by computer\nup to very large values of $c_0$, but is unproven in general. It is also\nnot known whether this problem is decideable. This is generally called\nthe *Collatz problem*.\n\nThe sequence $c_n$ is sometimes called the \u201chailstone sequence\u201d. This is\nbecause it behaves analogously to a hailstone in a cloud which falls by\ngravity and is tossed up again repeatedly. The sequence similarly ends\nin an eternal oscillation.",
