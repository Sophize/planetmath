  "definition": "A prime number $p$ that in a given base $b$ is also a palindromic\nnumber. Although there are infinitely many palindromic numbers in any\ngiven base, it is not known if the same is true of palindromic primes.\n\nIf $b + 1$ is prime, then it is the only palindromic prime in base $b$\nto have an even number of digits; all other palindromes with an even\nnumber of digits will be multiples of $b + 1$.",
