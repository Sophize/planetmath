  "definition": "A *palindrome* is a number which yields itself when its digits are\nreversed. Some palindromes (in base 10) are :\n\n-   121\n\n-   2002\n\n-   314159951413\n\nClearly one can construct palindromes of arbitrary length by taking any\nnumber and appending to it a reversed copy of itself or of all but the\nlast digit.\n\nThe concept of palindromes can also be extended to sequences and\nstrings.",
