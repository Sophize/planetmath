  "statement": "The existence and uniqueness of decimal expansions (or more generally,\nbase-$b$ expansions) is taken for granted by most grade school students,\nbut they are facts that need to be rigorously proven if one wants to\nunderstand the real numbers thoroughly.\n\nWe mention the following fact about natural numbers\n$n,m \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0$, which we will use many times implicitly:\n$$n < m \\Leftrightarrow n \\leq m-1\\,$$ This fact can be proven by\nmathematical induction on $m$.\n\nProof of Existence\n==================\n\nLet $x$ be a number for which we want to write a base-$b$ expansion for\nany natural number $b$ greater than one.\n\nWe shall assume $x \\geq 0$, since the base-$b$ expansion of a negative\nnumber is by definition the negative of the expansion for its absolute\nvalue.\n\nExpansions for non-negative integers\n------------------------------------\n\nFirst we prove the existence of expansions of the form\n$$x = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i\\,, \\quad 0 \\leq a_i < b\\,, a_i \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0$$\nfor non-negative integers $x$, using mathematical induction. (This proof\nis essentially the formal statement of how to do addition by base-$b$\ndigits.)\n\nThe number $x = 0$ obviously has the expansion $0$.\n\nSuppose that we know the existence of expansions for a number $x-1$. We\nprove the existence of an expansion for $x$.\n\nLet $x-1$ be expanded as\n$$x - 1 = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i\\,, \\quad 0 \\leq a_i < b\\,, a_i \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0\\,, a_{k+1} = 0\\,.$$\nFrom the above equation, add $1$ to both sides:\n$$x = (a_0+1) + \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i b^i \\,.$$ If $a_0 < b-1$, then we are\ndone. Otherwise, $(a_0+1) = b$, and therefore we may write instead\n$$x = 0 + (a_1+1) b + \\sum_{i=2}^k a_i b^i\\,.$$ If $a_1 < b-1$, then we\ncan stop. Otherwise, repeat the process and continue carrying digits\nuntil we reach some $i$ for which $a_i < b-1$. Since $a_{k+1} = 0$, this\nprocess is guaranteed to stop. At the end we will have expressed $x$ in\nbase $b$.\n\nReduction to numbers in $[0,1)$\n-------------------------------\n\nLet $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ be the greatest integer less than or equal to\n$x$, otherwise known as the floor of $x$. We prove that the floor of $x$\nexists.\n\nThe set $$A = \\{ n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_0 \\colon n \\leq x \\}$$ is bounded\nabove by $x$. However, by the Archimedean property, the set of natural\nnumbers is *not* bounded above, so ${\\mathbb{N}}_0 \\setminus A$ must be\nnon-empty, and have a smallest element $u$ (formally, by the\nwell-ordering principle). For every $n \\in A$, we have $n \\leq x < u$.\nThe latter condition is equivalent to $n \\leq u-1 < x$, so $u-1$ is the\nmaximum element of $A$. In other words, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = u-1$.\n\nSince $u-1 \\leq x < u$, we have $0 \\leq x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor < 1$. We\nshall obtain the base $b$ expansion of $x$ as the sum of the expansion\nof $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ and $x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n\nExpansion of numbers in $[0,1)$\n-------------------------------\n\nGiven $x \\in [0,1)$, let $a_1 = \\lfloor bx \\rfloor$. Then\n$0 \\leq a_1 \\leq bx < b$, so we can take $a_1$ as the first digit of the\nbase-$b$ expansion of $x$. Next, write $$x = a_1 b^{-1} + yb^{-1}\\,,$$\nand observe that\n$0 \\leq x - a_1 b^{-1} = b^{-1} (bx - \\lfloor bx \\rfloor) < b^{-1}$, so\nit is possible to get the next digit of the expansion by expanding $y$.\nWe do this recursively, leading to these recursive relations:\n$$y_{i} = a_i b^{-1} + y_{i+1} b^{-1} \\,, \\quad 0 \\leq a_i = \\lfloor by_i \\rfloor < b\\,, \\quad 0 \\leq y_i < 1\\,, \\quad y_1 = x\\,.$$\nMore explicitly, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\nx - (a_1 b^{-1} + a_2 b^{-2} + \\dotsb + a_k b^{-k}) &= \nb^{-1} \\bigl( y_2 - (a_2 b^{-1} + \\dotsb + a_k b^{-k+1}) \\bigr) \\\\ &=\nb^{-2} \\bigl( y_3 - (a_3 b^{-1} + \\dotsb + a_k b^{-k+2}) \\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\dotsb \\\\\n&= b^{-k+1} (y_{k} - a_k b^{-1}) \\\\\n&= b^{-k} y_{k+1}\\,.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIt is easy to prove that the expansion\n$$a_1 b^{-1} + a_2 b^{-2} + \\dotsb + a_k b^{-k} + \\dotsb$$ converges to\n$x$:\n$$0 \\leq x - \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i b^{-i} = b^{-k} y_{k+1} < \\frac{1}{b^k} \\to 0\\,, \\quad\n\\text{as $k \\to \\infty$.}$$ (Formally, the \u201c$\\to 0$\u201d part appeals to the\nArchimedean property.)\n\nProof of uniqueness\n===================\n\nUniqueness for non-negative integers\n------------------------------------\n\nSuppose that $$x = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i\\,, \\quad 0 \\leq a_i < b\\,.$$ Now\n$$a_k b^k \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i \\leq a_k b^k + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-1) b^i = a_k b^k + (b^k - 1) < (a_k + 1)b^k\\,,$$\nand the intervals $[a_k b^k, (a_k+1)b^k)$ are disjoint for each value of\n$a_k$, so $a_k$ is uniquely determined by where $x$ lies in amongst\nthese intervals.\n\nThen we can consider $$x - a_k b^k = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i b^i\\,.$$\nRepeating the previous argument with $k$ replaced by $k-1$, we see that\n$a_{k-1}$ is uniquely determined. Then we can consider\n$x - a_k b^k - a_{k-1} b^{k-1}$ and so on. Continuing this way, we see\nthat all the digits $a_i$ are uniquely determined.\n\nNear-uniqueness for non-negative numbers\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf\n$$x = a_k b^k + \\dotsb + a_1 b + a_0 + a_{-1} b^{-1} + a_{-2} b^{-2} + \\dotsb$$\nthen $a_0, \\dotsc, a_k$ are uniquely determined, since\n$a_k b^k + \\dotsb + a_1 + a_0$ is the expansion for the non-negative\ninteger $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$.\n\nThe argument to prove that $a_{-i}$ are uniquely determined proceeds\nsimilarly as before. We have $$\\begin{aligned}\na_{-1} b^{-1} &\\leq a_{-1} b^{-1} + a_{-2} b^{-2} + \\dotsb \\\\\n&\\leq a_{-1} b^{-1} + \\sum_{i=2}^\\infty (b-1) b^{-i} \n& \\text{(geometric series)}\n\\\\\n&= a_{-1} b^{-1} + \\frac{(b-1)b^2}{1-b^{-1}} \\\\\n&= (a_{-1}+1)\\, b^{-1}\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ where equality on the second\nline occurs if and only if $a_{-i} = b-1$ for every $i \\geq 2$. If we\ninsist that $a_{-i}$ is never eventually the same digit $b-1$, then this\nshows that the digit $a_{-1}$ is uniquely determined by where the\noriginal number $x$ in the disjoint intervals\n$[a_{-1} b^{-1}, (a_{-1} + 1) b^{-1})$.\n\nThis argument may be repeated, to show that $a_{-i}$ are uniquely\ndetermined, under the assumption that the expansion does not end in all\ndigits being $b-1$.\n\nIf the assumption is not made, then numbers which have an expansion\nending in all digits $0$ have an alternate expansion ending in all\ndigits $b-1$, but other numbers still have unique base-$b$ expansions.\n\nEvery base-$b$ expansion represents a real number\n=================================================\n\nWe also want to prove that for every sequence of digits\n$a_k, a_{k-1}, \\dotsc, a_1, a_0, a_{-1}, a_{-2}, \\dotsc$ there exists a\nreal number $x$ with the base-$b$ expansion\n$$x = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i + \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_{-i} b^{-i}\\,.$$\n\nThis is the where we use the least upper bounds property of the real\nnumbers. (So far we have only used the Archimedean property, so what we\nhave done so far is also valid for ${\\mathbb{Q}}$.)\n\nConsider the sequence $\\{ s_n \\}$ with the\n$$s_n = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b^i + \\sum_{i=0}^n a_{-i} b^{-i}\\,.$$ This\nsequence, considered as a set, is bounded above, for\n$s_n \\leq a_k b^k + \\dotsb + a_0 + 1$. So it has a least upper bound\n$x$. Since the sequence $\\{ s_n \\}$ is also *increasing*, its least\nupper bound is the same as its limit.",
