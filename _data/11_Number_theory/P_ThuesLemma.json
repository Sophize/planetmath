  "statement": "Let $p$ be a prime number of the form $4k+1$ . Then there are two unique\nintegers $a$ and $b$ with $0<a<b$ such that $p=a^2+b^2$. Additionally,\nif a number $p$ can be written in as the sum of two squares in 2\ndifferent ways (i.e. $p=a^2+b^2$ and $p=c^2+d^2$ with the two sums being\ndifferent), then the number $p$ is composite.",
