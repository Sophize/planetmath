  "definition": "[*Binomial equation*]{} is an algebraic equation of the $$x^n-a = 0$$\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer, $a$ belongs to a certain field (or\nsometimes to a certain ring) and $x$ is the unknown (or the\nindeterminate) of the equation. Solving the binomial equation means\ntaking the of $a$.\n\nThe binomial equation is written also $$x^n = a.$$ Such a binomial\nequation may be examined in a group, too.\n\nA special case of the binomial equation is the [*cyclotomic equation*]{}\n$$x^n-1 = 0.$$ This name comes from the fact that the of the equation\nthe unit circle in the complex plane into $n$ equally long arcs (Greek\n$\\varkappa\\acute{\\upsilon}\\varkappa\\lambda{o}\\varsigma$ \u2018circle\u2019,\n$\\tau\\acute{o}\\mu{o}\\varsigma$ \u2018part\u2019).",
