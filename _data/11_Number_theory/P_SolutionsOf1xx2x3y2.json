  "statement": "This article shows that the only solutions in integers to the equation\n$$1+x+x^2+x^3=y^2$$ are the obvious trivial solutions $x=0,\\pm 1$\ntogether with $x=7, y=20$. This result was known to Fermat.\n\nFirst, note that the equation is $(1+x)(1+x^2)=y^2$, so we have\nimmediately that $x\\ge -1$. So, noting the solutions for $x=0,\\pm 1$,\nassume in what follows that $x>1$.\n\nLet $d=\\gcd(1+x,1+x^2)$. Then $x\\equiv -1\\pmod d$, so that\n$1+x^2\\equiv 2\\pmod d$. But $d\\mid 1+x^2$ so that $2\\equiv 0\\pmod d$ and\n$d$ is either $1$ or $2$. If $d=1$, so that $1+x$ and $1+x^2$ are\ncoprime, then $1+x$ and $1+x^2$ must both be squares. But $1+x^2$ is not\na square for $x>1$. Thus the $\\gcd$ of $1+x$ and $1+x^2$ is $2$, so each\nmust be twice a square, say $$\\begin{gathered}\n1+x=2r^2\\\\\n1+x^2=2s^2\\end{gathered}$$ and then\n$$(r^2)^2+(r^2-1)^2=\\left(\\frac{1+x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{-1+x}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{1+x^2}{2}=s^2$$\nso that $r^2, r^2-1, s$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple (note that\n$r>1$ since $x>1$).\n\nRecall that if $(a,b,c)$ is a primitive Pythagorean triple, then\nprecisely one of $a$ and $b$ is even, and we can choose coprime integers\n$p,q$ such that $a=p^2-q^2, b=2pq, c=p^2+q^2$ or\n$a=2pq, b=p^2-q^2, c=p^2+q^2$ depending on the parity of $a$.\n\nSuppose first that $r$ is odd. Then $$\\begin{gathered}\nr^2=p^2-q^2\\\\\nr^2-1=2pq\\\\\ns=p^2+q^2\\end{gathered}$$ Then $1=r^2-(r^2-1)=(p-q)^2-2q^2$. Now, note\nthat $p-q$ must be a square, say $p-q=t^2$, since $\\gcd(p-q,p+q)=1$ and\n$(p-q)(p+q)$ is a square. Then $$t^4=(p-q)^2=2q^2+1=(q^2+1)^2-q^4$$ so\nthat $$t^4+q^4=(q^2+1)^2$$ But we know that only for the trivial case\nwhere all are zero. So $r$ cannot be odd.\n\nSo suppose that $r$ is even. Then $$\\begin{gathered}\nr^2=2pq\\\\\nr^2-1=p^2-q^2\\\\\ns=p^2+q^2\\end{gathered}$$ From the second of these formulas, we see that\n$p$ must be even (consider both sides $\\pmod 4$), say $p=2t^2$. Now,\n$$\\begin{gathered}\n(p+q-1)(p+q+1)=(p+q)^2-1=p^2+2pq+q^2-1=\\\\\np^2+2pq+q^2-(r^2-(r^2-1))=p^2+2pq+q^2-2pq+p^2-q^2=2p^2=8t^4\\end{gathered}$$\nSince $p$ and $q$ have opposite parity, $p+q\\pm 1$ are even, so that\n$$2t^4=\\frac{p+q-1}{2}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{p+q-1}{2}+1\\right)=u(u+1)$$ Thus\none of $u,u+1$ is a fourth power and the other is twice a fourth power,\nsay $b^4$ and $2c^4$.\n\nNow, $$\\begin{gathered}\nu=b^4\\Rightarrow u+1=2c^4\\Rightarrow b^4-2c^4=-1\\\\\nu=2c^4\\Rightarrow u+1=b^4\\Rightarrow b^4-2c^4=1\\end{gathered}$$ so that\n$b^4-2c^4=\\pm 1$.\n\nIf $b^4-2c^4=1$, then $$((c^2)^2+1)^2=(c^2)^4+b^4$$ and again we have a\nsquare being the sum of two fourth powers. So this case is impossible.\n\nIf $b^4-2c^4=-1$, write $e=c^2$, then $(e^2-1)^2=e^4-b^4$. It follows\n(see ) that either $b=0$ or $e^2-1=0$. If $b=0$, we get the\nimpossibility $e^4-2e^2+1=e^4$, while if $(e^2-1)^2=0$, then\n$e^4=b^4, e=\\pm 1$ and so $b=\\pm 1$. Then\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{p+q-1}{2}=b^4=1$, so that $p+q=3$. Thus $r^2=4$, so\n$r=2$ and, finally, $1+x=2r^2=8$, so that $x=7$.\n\nThus, the only nontrivial solution to the equation given is\n$$1+7+49+343=400$$",
