  "definition": "[*Addition*]{} is a mathematical operation in which two or more numbers\nare added up. The numbers being added are usually called the *addends*,\nwhile the result is usually called the *sum*. The numbers may be real,\nimaginary or complex. Two examples: 2 + 2 = 4;\n$4 + \\pi \\approx 7.14159$. In the realm of real numbers, adding up\npositive numbers yields a result that is greater than any of the\nsummands.\n\nThe usual symbol for addition is the cross with its four arms of equal\nlength pointing north, east, west and south: +. This operator is used in\nstandard infix notation as well as in Polish notation and reverse Polish\nnotation. The operation of addition is commutative, so $x + y = y + z$.\nMoreover, it is associative, so $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$. Combining\nthese two facts leads to the observation that if $S$ is a finite set of\nnumbers, then we can add them up one by one in any order without any\npotential ambiguity in the resulting sum. This allows us to define the\nsigma notation $$\\sum_{x\\in S} x$$ for the sum of finitely many numbers.\nFor example, the sum of the first $n$ positive perfect cubes can be\nwritten as $$\\sum_{i\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}} i^3.$$ An alternate way of writing\nthe same sum is $$\\sum_{i=1}^n i^3.$$ Here we might imagine the sum as\nbeing produced by an iterative process. But because of the\naforementioned commutativity and associativity, it doesn\u2019t matter if the\niterator is started at the smallest value or the largest value.\n\nA notable property of the iterative sum is that\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^n i^3 = \\biggl(\\sum_{i = 1}^n i\\biggr)^2.$$\n\n(See Nicomachus\u2019 theorem).\n\nBesides the possibility of overflow, addition presents no problems for\nfixed point arithmetic provided the operands are representable in fixed\npoint to begin with. In floating point there exists the possibility of\nloss of precision (if for example we were to add up several different\nirrational numbers).",
