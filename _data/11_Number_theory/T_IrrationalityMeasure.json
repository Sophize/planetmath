  "definition": "Let $\\alpha\\not\\in\\mathbb Q$. Let\n$$M(\\alpha)=\\{\\mu>0 \\mid \\exists q_0=q_0(\\alpha,\n\\mu)>0\n\\mbox{ such that }\n\\left|\\alpha-\\frac pq\\right|>\\frac1{q^\\mu} \\quad\n\\forall p,q\\in\\mathbb Z, q>q_0\\}.$$ The irrationality measure of\n$\\alpha$, denoted by $\\mu(\\alpha)$, is defined by\n$$\\mu(\\alpha)=\\inf M(\\alpha).$$\n\nIf $M(\\alpha)=\\emptyset$, we set $\\mu(\\alpha)=\\infty$.\n\nThis definition is (loosely) a measure of the extent to which $\\alpha$\ncan be approximated by rational numbers. Of course, by the fact that\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can make arbitrarily good\napproximations to real numbers by rationals. Thus this definition was\nmade to represent a stronger statement: it is the ability of rational\nnumbers to approximate $\\alpha$ given a fixed growth bound on the\ndenominators of those rational numbers.\n\nBy the Dirichlet\u2019s Lemma, $\\mu(\\alpha)\\ge 2$. Roth [@Roth955; @Roth955b]\nproved in 1955 that $\\mu(\\alpha)=2$ for every algebraic real number. It\nis well known also that $\\mu(e)=2$. For almost all real numbers the\nirrationality measure is 2. However, for special constants, only some\nupper bounds are known:\n\n     Constant     Upper bound                      Reference\n  -------------- ------------- -------------------------------------------------\n      $\\pi$         8.0161                    Hata (1993) [@hata]\n   $\\pi/\\sqrt3$     4.6016                    Hata (1993) [@hata]\n       $e$             2                   Davis (1978) [@davis978]\n     $\\pi^2$        5.4413           Rhin and Viola (1996) [@RhinViol996]\n     $\\log2$        3.8914      Rukhadze (1987) [@rukh], Hata (1990) [@hata990]\n    $\\zeta(3)$      5.5139           Rhin and Viola (2001) [@RhinViol001]\n\nIt is worth noting that the last column of the above table is simply a\nlist of references, not a collection of discoverers.
