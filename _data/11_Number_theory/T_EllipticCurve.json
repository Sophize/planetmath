  "definition": "Basics\n======\n\nAn [*elliptic curve*]{} over a field $K$ is a projective nonsingular\nalgebraic curve $E$ over $K$ of genus 1 together with a point $O$ of $E$\ndefined over $K$. The word \u201cgenus\u201d is taken here in the algebraic\ngeometry sense, and has no relation with the topological notion of genus\n(defined as $1 - \\chi/2$, where $\\chi$ is the Euler characteristic)\nexcept when the field of definition $K$ is the complex numbers\n$\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nUsing the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves, one can show that every\nelliptic curve $E$ is the zero set of a [*Weierstrass equation*]{} of\nthe form $$E: y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6,$$ for\nsome $a_i \\in K$, where the polynomial on the right hand side has no\ndouble roots. When $K$ has characteristic other than 2 or 3, one can\nfurther simpify this Weierstrass equation into the form\n$$E: y^2 = x^3 - 27 c_4 x - 54 c_6.$$ The extremely strange numbering of\nthe coefficients is an artifact of the process by which the above\nequations are derived. Also, note that these equation are for affine\ncurves; to translate them to projective curves, one has to homogenize\nthe equations (replace $x$ with $X/Z$, and $y$ with $Y/Z$).\n\nExamples\n========\n\nWe present here some pictures of elliptic curves over the field\n$\\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers. These pictures are in some sense\n[**not**]{} representative of most of the elliptic curves that people\nwork with, since many of the interesting cases tend to be of elliptic\ncurves over algebraically closed fields. However, curves over the\ncomplex numbers (or, even worse, over algebraically closed fields in\ncharacteristic $p$) are very difficult to graph in three dimensions, let\nalone two.\n\nFigure\u00a0\\[01-1\\] is a graph of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$.\n\nFigure\u00a0\\[0-11\\] shows the graph of $y^2 = x^3 - x + 1$:\n\nFinally, Figures\u00a0\\[001\\] and\u00a0\\[000\\] are examples of algebraic curves\nthat are [**not**]{} elliptic curves. Both of these curves have\nsingularities at the origin.\n\nThe Group Law\n=============\n\nThe points on an elliptic curve have a natural group structure, which\nmakes the elliptic curve into an abelian variety. There are many\nequivalent ways to define this group structure; two of the most common\nare:\n\n-   Every Weyl divisor on $E$ is linearly equivalent to a unique divisor\n    of the form $[P] - [O]$ for some $P \\in E$, where $O \\in E$ is the\n    base point. The divisor class group of $E$ then yields a group\n    structure on the points of $E$, by way of this correspondence.\n\n-   Let $O \\in E$ denote the base point. Then one can show that every\n    line joining two points on $E$ intersects a unique third point of\n    $E$ (after properly accounting for tangent lines as a multiple\n    intersection). For any two points $P,Q \\in E$, define their sum as:\n\n    1.  Form the line between $P$ and $Q$; let $R$ be the third point on\n        $E$ that intersects this line;\n\n    2.  Form the line between $O$ and $R$; define $P+Q$ to be the third\n        point on $E$ that intersects this line.\n\n    This addition operation yields a group operation on the points of\n    $E$ having the base point $O$ for identity.\n\nElliptic Curves over $\\mathbb{C}$\n=================================\n\nOver the complex numbers, the general correspondence between algebraic\nand analytic theory specializes in the elliptic curves case to yield\nsome very useful insights into the structure of elliptic curves over\n$\\mathbb{C}$. The starting point for this investigation is the\nWeierstrass ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\u2013function, which we define here.\n\nA [*lattice*]{} in ${\\mathbb{C}}$ is a subgroup $L$ of the additive\ngroup $\\mathbb{C}$ which is generated by two elements\n$\\omega_1, \\omega_2 \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$ that are linearly independent over\n${\\mathbb{R}}$.\n\nFor any lattice $L$ in ${\\mathbb{C}}$, the [*Weierstrass\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}_L$\u2013function*]{} of $L$ is the function\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}_L: {\\mathbb{C}}\\longrightarrow {\\mathbb{C}}$ given by\n$${{\\mathfrak{p}}}_L(z) := \\frac{1}{z^2} + \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\left( \\frac{1}{(z-\\omega)^2} - \\frac{1}{\\omega^2}\\right).$$\n\nWhen the lattice $L$ is clear from context, it is customary to suppress\nit from the notation and simply write ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ for the\nWeierstrass ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\u2013function.\n\n[**Properties of the Weierstrass ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\u2013function:**]{}\n\n-   ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z)$ is a meromorphic function with double poles at\n    points in $L$.\n\n-   ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z)$ is constant on each coset of ${\\mathbb{C}}/L$.\n\n-   ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z)$ satisfies the differential equation\n    $${{\\mathfrak{p}}}'(z)^2 = 4 {{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z)^3 - g_2 {{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z) - g_3$$\n    where the constants $g_2$ and $g_3$ are given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n    g_2 & := & 60 \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{\\omega^4} \\\\\n    g_3 & := & 140 \\sum_{\\omega \\in L \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{\\omega^6}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe last property above implies that, for any $z \\in {\\mathbb{C}}/L$,\nthe point $({{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z),{{\\mathfrak{p}}}'(z))$ lies on the\nelliptic curve $E: y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2 x - g_3$. Let\n$\\phi: {\\mathbb{C}}/L \\longrightarrow E$ be the map given by\n$$\\phi(z) := \n\\begin{cases}\n({{\\mathfrak{p}}}(z),{{\\mathfrak{p}}}'(z)) & z \\notin L \\\\\n\\infty & z \\in L\n\\end{cases}$$ (where $\\infty$ denotes the point at infinity on $E$).\nThen $\\phi$ is actually a bijection (!), and moreover the map\n$\\phi: {\\mathbb{C}}/L \\longrightarrow E$ is an isomorphism of Riemann\nsurfaces as well as a group isomorphism (with the addition operation on\n${\\mathbb{C}}/L$ inherited from ${\\mathbb{C}}$, and the elliptic curve\ngroup operation on $E$).\n\nWe can go even further: it turns out that [**every**]{} elliptic curve\n$E$ over ${\\mathbb{C}}$ can be obtained in this way from some lattice\n$L$. More precisely, the following is true:\n\n1.  For every elliptic curve $E: y^2 = 4x^3 - b x - c$ over\n    ${\\mathbb{C}}$, there is a unique lattice $L \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$\n    whose constants $g_2$ and $g_3$ satisfy $b = g_2$ and $c = g_3$.\n\n2.  Two elliptic curves $E$ and $E'$ over ${\\mathbb{C}}$ are isomorphic\n    if and only if their corresponding lattices $L$ and $L'$ satisfy the\n    equation $L' = \\alpha L$ for some scalar $\\alpha \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\n[9]{} Dale Husemoller, [*Elliptic Curves*]{}.
