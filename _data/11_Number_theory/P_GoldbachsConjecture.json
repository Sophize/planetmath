  "statement": "The conjecture states that every even integer $n>2$ is expressible as\nthe sum of two primes.\n\nIn 1966 Chen proved that every sufficiently large even number can be\nexpressed as the sum of a prime and a number with at most two prime\ndivisors.\n\nVinogradov proved that every sufficiently large *odd* number is a sum of\nthree primes. In 1997 it was shown by J.-M. Deshouillers, G. Effinger,\nH. Te Riele, and D. Zinoviev that, assuming a generalized Riemann\nhypothesis, every odd number $n>5$ can be represented as sum of three\nprimes.\n\nThe conjecture was first proposed in a 1742 letter from Christian\nGoldbach to Euler and still remains unproved.",
