  "definition": "The square root of a nonnegative real number $x$, written as $\\sqrt{x}$,\nis the unique nonnegative real number $y$ such that $y^2=x$. Thus,\n$(\\sqrt{x})^2 \\equiv x$. Or, $\\sqrt{x}\\times\\sqrt{x}\\equiv x$.\n\n$\\sqrt{9}=3$ because $3\\geq 0$ and $3^2=3\\times 3=9$.\n\n$\\sqrt{x^2+2x+1}=\\vert x+1\\vert$ (see absolute value and even-even-odd\nrule) because $(x+1)^2=(x+1)(x+1)=x^2+x+x+1=x^2+2x+1$.\n\nIn some situations it is better to allow two values for $\\sqrt{x}$. For\nexample, $\\sqrt{4}=\\pm 2$ because $2^2=4$ and $(-2)^2=4$.\n\nOver nonnegative real numbers, the square root operation is left\ndistributive over multiplication and division, but not over addition or\nsubtraction. That is, if $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative real numbers, then\n$\\sqrt{x\\times y}=\\sqrt{x}\\times\\sqrt{y}$ and\n$\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{y}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{y}}$.\n\n$\\sqrt{x^{2}y^{2}}=xy$ because\n$(xy)^2=xy\\times xy=x\\times x\\times y\\times y=x^2\\times y^2=x^{2}y^{2}$.\n\n$\\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{25}}=\\frac{3}{5}$ because\n$\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2=\\frac{3^2}{5^2}=\\frac{9}{25}$.\n\nOn the other hand, in general, $\\sqrt{x+y}\\neq\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}$ and\n$\\sqrt{x-y}\\neq\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}$. This error is an instance of the\nfreshman\u2019s dream error.\n\nThe square root notation is actually an alternative to exponentiation.\nThat is, $\\sqrt{x} \\equiv x^\\frac{1}{2}$. When it is defined, the square\nroot operation is commutative with exponentiation. That is,\n$\\sqrt{x^a}=x^\\frac{a}{2}=(\\sqrt{x})^a$ whenever both $x^a>0$ and $x>0$.\nThe restrictions can be lifted if we extend the domain and codomain of\nthe square root function to the complex numbers.\n\nNegative real numbers do not have real square roots. For example,\n$\\sqrt{-4}$ is not a real number. This fact can be as follows: Suppose\n$\\sqrt{-4}=x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is negative, then $x^2$ is positive,\nand if $x$ is positive, then $x^2$ is also positive. Therefore, $x$\ncannot be positive or negative. Moreover, $x$ cannot be zero either,\nbecause $0^2=0$. Hence, $\\sqrt{-4}\\notin\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor additional discussion of the square root and negative numbers, see\nthe discussion of complex numbers.\n\nThe square root function generally maps rational numbers to algebraic\nnumbers; $\\sqrt{x}$ is rational if and only if $x$ is a rational number\nwhich, after cancelling, is a fraction of two squares. In particular,\n$\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\nThe function is continuous for all nonnegative $x$, and differentiable\nfor all positive $x$ (it is not differentiable for $x=0$). Its\nderivative is given by:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\big(\\sqrt{x}\\big)=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}$$\n\nIt is possible to consider square roots in rings other than the integers\nor the rationals. For any ring $R$, with $x,y\\in R$, we say that $y$ is\na square root of $x$ if $y^2=x$.\n\nWhen working in the ring of , we give a special name to members of the\nring that have a square root. We say $x$ is a quadratic residue modulo\n$n$ if there exists $y$ coprime to $x$ such that $y^2\\equiv x\\pmod{n}$.\nRabin\u2019s cryptosystem is based on the difficulty of finding square roots\nmodulo an integer $n$.",
