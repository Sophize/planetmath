  "definition": "The *square root of 3*, also known as *Theodorus\u2019s constant*, is the\nnumber the square of which is equal to the integer 3. It is an\nirrational number, one of the first few to have been proved irrational.\nTheodorus of Cyrene proved that the square roots of the integers 3, 5 to\n8, 10 to 15 and 17 are all irrational. The decimal expansion of\n$\\sqrt{3}$ is 1.7320508075688772935... (sequence in Sloane\u2019s OEIS). Its\nsimple continued fraction is\n$$1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\ldots}}}},$$\nrepeating 1 and 2 periodically (Sloane\u2019s ).\n\nGiven a unit cube, the diagonal from the vertex joining three sides to\nthe other vertex joining the three other sides is $\\sqrt{3}$. Given a\nunit hexagon, the distance from one side to the parallel opposite side\nis $\\sqrt{3}$. More generally, the ratio of the length of a side of a\nhexagon to the distance from that side to the opposing parallel side is\n$1 : \\sqrt{3}$, and the same ratio applies to the length of the side of\na cube to the diagonal of that cube.\n\n[1]{} M.
