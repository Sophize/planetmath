  "definition": "The *sieve of Eratosthenes* is the number-theoretic version of the\nprinciple of inclusion-exclusion. In the typical application of the\nsieve of Eratosthenes one is concerned with estimating the number of\nelements of a set $\\mathcal{A}$ that are not divisible by any of the\nprimes in the set $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\ncan be written as $$\\label{eq:mobius}\n\\sum_{\\substack{d\\mid n\\\\d\\mid P}}\\mu(d)=\\sum_{d\\mid \\gcd(n,P)}\n\\mu(d)=\\begin{cases}1,&\\text{if }\\gcd(n,P)=1,\\\\0,&\\text{if\n}\\gcd(n,P)>1.\\end{cases}$$\n\nIf we set $P=\\prod_{p\\in\\mathcal{P}} p$ then is the of the set of\nnumbers that are not divisible by any of the primes in $\\mathcal{P}$. If\nwe set $A_d$ to be the number of elements of $A$ that are divisible by\n$d$, then the number of elements of $A$ that are not divisible by any\nprimes in $\\mathcal{P}$ can be expressed as $$\\label{eq:sieve}\n\\sum_{n\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\sum_{\\substack{d\\mid n\\\\d\\mid\nP}}\\mu(d)=\\sum_{d\\mid\nP}\\mu(d)\\sum_{\\substack{n\\in\\mathcal{A}\\\\d\\mid n}}1=\\sum_{d\\mid\nP}\\mu(d)A_d.$$\n\n*Example.* To establish an upper bound on the number of primes less than\n$x$ we set $\\mathcal{A}=\\{y,y+1,\\dotsc,x\\}$ and $P=\\{p :\np \\text{ is a prime less than }y\\}$. Then counts the number of integers\nbetween $y$ and $x$ that are not divisible by any prime less than $y$.\nHence the number of primes not exceeding $x$ is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(x)&\\leq \\sum_{d\\mid P}\\mu(d) \\bigl((x-y)/d+O(1)\\bigr)\\\\\n      &\\leq x\\sum_{d\\mid P}\\frac{\\mu(d)}{d}+O({\\left\\lvert P\\right\\rvert})\\\\\n      &= x\\prod_{p\\leq y} (1-1/p)+O(2^y).\\end{aligned}$$ By Mertens\u2019\nestimate for $\\prod (1-1/p)$ the main term is\n$$x\\frac{e^{-\\gamma}+o(1)}{\\log y},$$ where $\\gamma$ is Euler\u2019s\nconstant. Setting $y=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\log x$ we obtain\n$$\\pi(x)\\leq \\bigl(e^{-\\gamma}+o(1)\\bigr)\\frac{x}{\\log\\log x}.$$ The\nobtained bound is clearly inferior to the prime number theorem, but the\nmethod applies to problems that are not tractable by the other\ntechniques.\n\nThe error term of the order $O(2^y)$ can be significantly reduced by\nusing more robust sifting procedures such as and Selberg\u2019s sieves.
