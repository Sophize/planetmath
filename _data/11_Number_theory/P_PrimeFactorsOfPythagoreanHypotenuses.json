Then also\n$$4n\\!-\\!1 \\mid c^2 \\;=\\; a^2\\!+\\!b^2 \n\\;=\\; (a\\!+\\!ib)(a\\!-\\!ib)$$ where $a$ and $b$ are the catheti in the\ntriple. But $4n\\!-\\!1$ is prime also in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ of the\nGaussian integers, whence it must divide at least one of the factors\n$a\\!+\\!ib$ and $a\\!-\\!ib$. Apparently, that would imply that $4n\\!-\\!1$\ndivides both $a$ and $b$. This means that the triple $(a, b, c)$ were\nnot primitive, whence the antithesis is wrong and the lemma true.\n$\\Box$\\\nAlso the converse is true in the following form:\n\n**Lemma 2.** If all prime factors of a positive integer $c$ are of the\nform $4n\\!+\\!1$, then $c$ is the hypotenuse in a Pythagorean triple.\n(Especially, any prime $4n\\!+\\!1$ is found as the hypotenuse in a\nprimitive Pythagorean triple.)\n\n[*Proof*]{}. For proving this, one can start from Fermat[\u2019]{}s theorem,\nby which the prime numbers of such form are sums of two squares (see the\n). Since the sums of two squares form a set closed under multiplication,\nnow also the product $c$ is a sum of two squares, and similarly is\n$c^2$, i.e. $c$ is the hypotenuse in a Pythagorean triple. $\\Box$\\\n[*Proof of the Theorem.*]{} Suppose that $c$ is the hypotenuse of a\nPythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$; dividing the triple members by their\ngreatest common factor we get a primitive triple $(a'\\!, b'\\!, c')$\nwhere $c'\\mid\\;c$. By Lemma 1, the prime factors of $c'$, being also\nprime factors of $c$, are of the form $4n\\!+\\!1$.\n\nOn the contrary, let\u2019s suppose that a prime factor $p$ of $c = pd$ is of\nthe form $4n\\!+\\!1$. Then Lemma 2 guarantees a Pythagorean triple\n$(r, s, p)$, whence also $(rd, sd, c)$ is Pythagorean and $c$ thus a\nhypotenuse. $\\Box$\\",
