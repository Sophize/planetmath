  "statement": "> ABSTRACT: \u00a0The Strong Goldbach conjecture, GC, dates back to $1742 $.\n> It states that every even integer greater than four can be written as\n> the sum of two prime numbers. Since then, no one has been able to\n> prove the conjecture. The conjecture has been verified to be true for\n> all even integers up to $4.10^{18} $. In this article, we prove that\n> the conjecture is true for all integers, with at least three different\n> ways. In short, this treaty has as objective show the proof of GC, and\n> presents a new resolution to the conjecture. Knowing that, these\n> infinities establish other groups of infinities, in a logical way the\n> conviction for the method and idea of proving it, we stand and\n> separate these groups to prove, not only a sequence, but the whole\n> embodiment of arithmetic properties called here as groups, as well as\n> its infinity conjectured for centuries.\\\n>\n> Keywords: Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture; Crystallographic group; Cobordism\n> group; Algebraic number theory; Multiprime Theorem\u2019s; Productoria\n> Table.\\\n>\n> AMS Subject Classification: 11N05; 11A41; 11A25; 11Y11; 11P32; 05A10;\n> 11N56; 11D99; 11P99; 11N32; 05A17.",
