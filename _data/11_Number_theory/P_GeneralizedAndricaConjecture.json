  "statement": "The *Andrica function* $A_{n}\\equiv\\sqrt{p_{n+1}}-\\sqrt{p_{n}}$, where\n$p_n$ is the n$^{\\text{th}}$ prime number can be plotted with\nmathematical software and for large $n$ it seems that $1\\gg A_{n}$,\nhowever the *Andrica conjecture* $1>A_{n}$ has not been yet proven and\nremains an open problem.\n\nSimilarly one can consider the *generalized Andrica function*\n$A_{G}(x,n)\\equiv p_{n+1}^{x}-p_{n}^{x}$ and plot it for\n$x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIt is clear that $ A_{G}(0,n)=0$.\n\nFor $x<0$, $A_{G}(x,n)$ is negative, and if $x\\rightarrow-\\infty$ then\n$A_{G}(x,n)\\rightarrow-\\infty$.\n\nFor $x>0$, $A_{G}(x,n)$ is positive, and if $x\\rightarrow+\\infty$ then\n$A_{G}(x,n)\\rightarrow+\\infty$.\n\nTherefore if one considers the *generalized Andrica equation*\n$A_{G}(x,n)=1$ and solves for $x$ then solutions for each $n$ will occur\nfor $x>0$. What is more it is easily provable that the biggest solution\nof generalized Andrica equation $x_{\\max}=1$ occurs for $n=1$, and for\n$n>1$ it is always the case that each solution of generalized Andrica\nequation $x_n<1$ because the minimal difference between two consequtive\nprimes is at best 2 for *twin primes*. However the value of the smallest\nsolution of generalized Andrica equation $x_{\\min}$ at the present time\nremains unknown and its existence is unproven.\n\nThe existence of minimal solution $x_{\\min}$ of the generalized Andrica\nequation is still unproven. However according to the *generalized\nAndrica conjecture* proposed by Florentin Smarandache the value of\n$x_{\\min}$, also known as the *Smarandache constant*, is\n$x_{\\min}\\approx0.5671481302\\ldots$ and occurs for $n=30$. If stated as\nan inequality the generalized Andrica conjecture states:\n\n$p _ {n+1} ^ x - p_ n ^ x < 1$ for $x < 0.567148 \\ldots$\n\nNumerical plots for the first $2\\times10^{11}$ primes show that the\nsolutions $x_n$ of $A_{G}(x,n)=1$ tend to be confined in the interval\n$(0.9,1)$ and according to generalized Andrica conjecture one hopes that\nthis behavior remains true as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n\nThe following plots of $A_G(x,n)$ were created with *Wolfram\u2019s\nMathematica 5.2*, the function plot range was cut off at $A_G(x,n)=1$,\nso the edge of the plateau is visualizing the exact solutions $x_n$ of\nthe equation $A_G(x,n)=1$.\n\n![image](200) ![image](200b)\n\nPlots for the first 200 primes. This plot most clearly visualizes the\nputative minimal solution $x_{\\min}$ known also as the Smarandache\nconstant, which seems to occur for $n=30$.\n\n![image](10-3) ![image](10-3b)\n\nPlots for the first 1000 primes.\n\n![image](2x10-3) ![image](2x10-3b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^3$ primes.\n\n![image](2x10-4) ![image](2x10-4b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^4$ primes.\n\n![image](2x10-5) ![image](2x10-5b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^5$ primes.\n\n![image](2x10-6) ![image](2x10-6b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^6$ primes.\n\n![image](2x10-9) ![image](2x10-9b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^9$ primes.\n\n![image](2x10-11) ![image](2x10-11b)\n\nPlots for the first $2 \\times 10^{11}$ primes.",
