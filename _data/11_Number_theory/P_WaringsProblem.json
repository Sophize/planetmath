  "statement": "Waring asked whether it is possible to represent every natural number as\na sum of number of nonnegative $k$\u2019th powers, that is, whether the set\n$\\{\\,n^k \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z_+}\\,\\}$ is an . He was led to this\nconjecture by which asserted that every natural number can be\nrepresented as a sum of four squares.\n\nHilbert [@cite:hilbert_waring] was the first to prove the conjecture for\nall $k$. In his paper he did not give an explicit bound on $g(k)$, the\nnumber of powers needed, but later it was proved that\n$$g(k)=2^k+\\left\\lfloor\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^k\\right\\rfloor-2$$\nexcept possibly finitely many exceptional $k$, none of which are known.\n\nWooley[@cite:wooley_waring], improving the result of\nVinogradov[@cite:vinogradov_waringG], proved that the number of $k$\u2019th\npowers needed to represent all *sufficiently large* integers is\n$$G(k)\\leq k (\\ln k + \\ln \\ln k + O(1)).$$\n\n[1]{}\n\nDavid Hilbert.
