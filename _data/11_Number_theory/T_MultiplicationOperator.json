  "definition": "A [*multiplication operator*]{} is an operator signifying multiplication\namong two or more operands. Common multiplication operators are\n$\\times$, $\\cdot$ and $\\ast$ as well as the tacit multiplication\noperator. The iterated multiplication operator is the Greek capital\nletter $\\Pi$. Most of these can be used in Polish notation or reverse\nPolish notation just as easily as in standard infix notation. For\nexample: $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$ or $2 \\quad 3 \\quad 7 \\times$.\n\nMost computer programming languages (such as FORTRAN and ) use the\nasterisk ($\\ast$), which is available as Shift-6 on almost all American\ntypewriters and computer keyboards. For arithmetic computations by hand\non paper, the cross ($\\times$) is prefered and this is the symbol that\nappears on the multiplication key of most calculators. The tacit\nmultiplication operator is mostly used in algebra to multiply named\nvariables or constants, or a single literal by single or multiple named\nvariables or constants.",
