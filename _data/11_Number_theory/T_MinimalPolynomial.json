  "definition": "Let $K/F$ be a field extension and $\\kappa \\in K$ be algebraic over $F$.\nThe *minimal polynomial for $\\kappa$ over $F$* is a monic polynomial\n$m(x)\\in F[x]$ such that $m(\\kappa)=0$ and, for any other polynomial\n$f(x) \\in F[x]$ with $f(\\kappa)=0$, $m$ divides $f$. Note that, for any\nelement $\\kappa$ that is algebraic over $F$, ; moreover, because of the\nmonic condition, it exists uniquely.\n\nGiven $\\kappa\\in K$, a polynomial $m$ is the minimal polynomial of\n$\\kappa$ if and only if $m(\\kappa)=0$ and $m$ is both monic and .",
