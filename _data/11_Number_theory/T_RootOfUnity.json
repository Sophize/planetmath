  "definition": "A *root of unity* is a number $\\omega$ such that some power $\\omega^n$,\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer, equals to $1$.\n\nSpecifically, if $K$ is a field, then the $n$th roots of unity in $K$\nare the numbers $\\omega$ in $K$ such that $\\omega^n = 1$. Equivalently,\nthey are all the roots of the polynomial $X^n-1$. No matter what field\n$K$ is, the polynomial can never have more than $n$ roots. Clearly $1$\nis an example; if $n$ is even, then $-1$ will also be an example. Beyond\nthis, the list of possibilities depends on $K$.\n\n-   If $K$ is the set of real numbers, then $1$ and $-1$ are the only\n    possibilities.\n\n-   If $K$ is the field of the complex numbers, the fundamental theorem\n    of algebra assures us that the polynomial $X^n-1$ has exactly $n$\n    roots (counting multiplicities). Comparing $X^n-1$ with its formal ,\n    $nX^{n-1}$, we see that they are coprime, and therefore all the\n    roots of $X^n-1$ are distinct. That is, there exist $n$ distinct\n    complex numbers $\\omega$ such that $\\omega^n=1$.\n\n    If $\\zeta=e^{2\\pi i/n}=\\cos(2\\pi/n)+i \\sin(2\\pi/n)$, then all the\n    $n$th roots of unity are: $\\zeta^k=e^{2\\pi ki/n}=\\cos(2\\pi k/n)+i\n    \\sin(2\\pi k/n)$ for $k=1,2,\\ldots,n$.\n\n    If drawn on the complex plane, the $n$th roots of unity are the\n    vertices of a regular $n$-gon centered at the origin and with a\n    vertex at $1$.\n\n-   If $K$ is a finite field having $p^a$ elements, for $p$ a prime,\n    then *every* nonzero element is a $p^a-1$th root of unity (in fact\n    this characterizes them completely; this is the role of the\n    Frobenius operator). For other $n$, the answer is more complicated.\n    For example, if $n$ is divisible by $p$, the formal derivative of\n    $X^n-1$ is $nX^{n-1}$, which is zero since the of $K$ is $p$ and $n$\n    is zero modulo $p$. So one is not guaranteed that the roots of unity\n    will be distinct. For example, in the field of two elements, $1=-1$,\n    so there is only one square root of $1$.\n\nIf an element $\\omega$ is an $n$th root of unity but is not an $m$th\nroot of unity for any $0<m<n$, then $\\omega$ is called a *$n$th root of\nunity*. For example, the number $\\zeta$ defined above is a $n$th root of\nunity. If $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity,\nthen all of the primitive $n$th roots of unity have the form $\\omega^m$\nfor some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $\\gcd(m,n)=1$.\n\nThe roots of unity in any field have many special relationships to one\nanother, some of which are true in general and some of which depend on\nthe field. It is upon these relationships that the various algorithms\nfor computing fast Fourier transforms are based.\n\nFinally, one could ask about similar situations where $K$ is not a field\nbut some more general object. Here, things are much more complicated.\nFor example, in the ring of endomorphisms of a vector space, the\nunipotent linear transformations are the closest analogue to roots of\nunity. They still form a group, but there may be many more of them than\n$n$. In a finite group, every element $g$ has a power $n$ such that\n$g^n=1$.",
