If there\nexists an integer $r$ such that $k=2r$, then $k$ is an [**even\nnumber**]{}.\n\nThe concept of even and odd numbers are most easily understood in the\nbinary base. Then the above definition simply that even numbers end with\na $0$, and odd numbers end with a $1$.\n\n### Properties\n\n1.  Every integer is either even or .
