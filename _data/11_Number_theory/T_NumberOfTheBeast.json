  "definition": "In the Book of Revelation of the [*Holy Bible*]{}, verse 13:18 in the\nKing James Version reads \u201cLet him that hath understanding count the\nnumber of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is\nSix hundred threescore and six.\u201d The translation by Ulrich Zwingli gives\nthe number of the beast as 616. Theologians have given various different\nexplanations for these numbers.\n\nIf 666 appears more mathematically interesting than 616, it could be\nbecause professional mathematicians and amateurs alike have studied it\nmore. Thus it has been noticed that the sum of the squares of the first\nseven primes is 666, that 666 is a doubly triangular number, that the\n666th member of the Padovan sequence is a prime, etc. 666 would be a\npandigital number in Roman numerals if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\nlacks the \u2019digit\u2019 M. In base 10, the number 666 is a Smith number and\nalso a repdigit (and a palidromic number as a trivial consequence of\nthat).\n\nWhereas 666 points to a prime in the Padovan sequence, 616 is itself a\nmember of that sequence. Other than that, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much\nabout 616 that is interesting. The T-shirt that jokes \u201c333: I\u2019m Only\nHalf Evil\u201d would be a much less funny 308.",
