  "definition": "If for a given prime $p$ it is true that $(p - 1)! \\equiv -1 \\mod p^2$,\nthen $p$ is called a [*Wilson prime*]{}. Like all other primes, Wilson\nprimes satisfy the primality condition of Wilson\u2019s theorem, but they\nalso divide the Wilson quotient. Only three are known as of 2007,\nnamely: 5, 13, 563 (A007540 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS, which normally requires at\nleast four terms before accepting sequences into the table). It is not\nknown if there are infinitely many Wilson primes exist; the fourth\nWilson prime would have to be greater than $10^9$.",
