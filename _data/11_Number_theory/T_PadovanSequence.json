  "definition": "Construct a recurrence relation with initial terms $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 0$,\n$a_2 = 0$ and $a_n = a_{n - 3} + a_{n - 2}$ for $n > 2$. The first few\nterms of the sequence defined by this recurrence relation are: 1, 0, 0,\n1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, 86, 114,\n151 (listed in A000931 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS). This is the [*Padovan\nsequence*]{}, named after mathematician Richard Padovan. Its generating\nfunction is $$G(a(n); x) = \\frac{1 - x^2}{1 - x^2 - x^3}$$.\n\nIt has been observed that in taking seven consecutive terms of this\nsequence, the sum of the squares of the first, third and seventh terms\nis equal to the sum of the squares of the second, fourth, fifth and\nsixth terms.\n\nThe $n$th Padovan number asymptotically matches the $n$th power of the\nplastic constant.",
