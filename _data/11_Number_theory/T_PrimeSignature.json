  "definition": "The [*prime signature*]{} of an integer $n$ is the list of nonzero\nexponents $a_i$ from the integer factorization\n$$n = \\prod_{i = 1}^{\\infty} {p_i}^{a_i},$$ (with $p_i$ being the $i$th\nprime) sorted in but with duplicates retained. Three examples: the prime\nsignature of 10368 is (4, 7), the prime signature of 10369 is (1), the\nprime signature of 10370 is (1, 1, 1, 1).\n\nThe prime signature of a number is insufficient to uniquely identify it.\nNumbers like 34992 and 514714375 also have prime signatures of (4, 7).\nHowever, prime signatures can identify some kinds of numbers: the primes\nhave signature (1); the squares of primes have signature (2), while\nother semiprimes have signature (1, 1); sphenic numbers have signature\n(1, 1, 1); etc. But while other kinds of numbers have different\nsignatures among their members, some generalizations can still be made,\nsuch as that highly composite numbers have prime signatures in reverse\norder of the factorization as usually stated with the primes from 2 up;\nor that Achilles numbers don\u2019t have any 1s in their prime signature but\nthe greatest common divisor of the numbers in the prime signature is 1.",
