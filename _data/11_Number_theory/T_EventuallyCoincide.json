  "definition": "Let $A$ and $B$ be two nonempty sets of integers. We say that $A$ and\n$B$ *eventually coincide* if there is an integer $C$ such that $n\\in A$\nif and only if $n\\in B$ for all $n\\geq C$. In this case, we write\n$A\\sim B$, noting that the relation of eventually coinciding is clearly\nan equivalence relation. While a seemingly trivial notation, this turns\nout to be the \u201cright\u201d notion of of sets when dealing with asymptotic\nproperties such as .\n\n[9]{} Nathanson, Melvyn B., *Elementary Methods in Number Theory*,\nGraduate Texts in Mathematics, Volume 195.
