  "definition": "Given the divisors $d_i$ of an integer $n$, if it is the case that for a\nparticular $d_i$ the equality $\\gcd(d_i, \\frac{n}{d_i}) = 1$ holds true,\nthen $d_i$ is called a [*unitary divisor*]{} of $n$. For example, the\nunitary divisors of 120 are 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 24, 40, 120 (while 2, 4, 6,\n10, 12, 20, 30, 60 are proper divisors but not unitary divisors). All\nthe divisors of squarefree numbers are also unitary divisors.",
