  "statement": "Theorem (Nicomachus). The sum of the cubes of the first $n$ integers is\nequal to the square of the $n$th triangular number. To put it\nalgebraically,\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^n i^3 = \\left( \\frac{n^2 + n}{2} \\right)^2.$$\n\nThere are several formulas for the triangular numbers. Gauss figured out\nthat to compute $$\\sum_{i = 1}^n i,$$ one can, instead of summing the\nnumbers one by one, pair up the numbers thus: $1 + n$, $2 + (n - 1)$,\n$3 + (n - 2)$, etc., and each of these sums has the same result, namely,\n$n + 1$. Since there are $n$ of these sums, carrying this all the way\nthrough to the end, we are in effect squaring $n + 1$, which is\n$(n + 1)^2 = (n + 1)(n + 1) = n^2 + n$. But this is redundant, since it\nincludes both $1 + n$ and $n + 1$, both $2 + (n - 1)$ and $(n - 1) + 2$,\netc., in effect, each of these twice. Therefore,\n$$\\frac{n^2 + n}{2} = \\sum_{i = 1}^n i.$$\n\nAs Sir Charles Wheatstone proved, we can rewrite $i^3$ as\n$$\\sum_{j = 1}^i (2ij + i).$$ That sum can always be rewritten as a sum\nof odd terms, namely $$\\sum_{k = 1}^i (i^2 + i + 2k).$$ Thus, the sum of\nthe first $n$ cubes is in fact also $$\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} (2i + 1).$$\nThe sum of the first $n - 1$ odd numbers is $n^2$, and therefore\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^n i^3 = \\left( \\sum_{i = 1}^n i \\right)^2,$$ as the\ntheorem states.\n\nFor example, the sum of the first four cubes is 1 + 9 + 27 + 64 = 100.\nThis is also equal to 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 100. The\nsquare root of 100 is 10, the fourth triangular number, and indeed 10 =\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4.",
