  "statement": "For brevity, we write $P_f$ for the set of finite places of $K$, and\n$P_{\\infty}$ for the set of infinite places. We also write\n${\\sideset{}{'}\\prod}$ for a restricted direct product. Then\n$${\\mathbb{A}}_K = {\\sideset{}{'}\\prod}_{v\\in P_f} K_v \\times \\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} K_v$$\n\n$K$ is discrete as a subgroup of ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$.\n\n**Proof.** Since ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$ is a topological ring, it suffices to\nshow that there is a neighborhood in ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$ meeting $K$ in\nonly $0$.\n\nLet\n$$U=\\prod_{v\\in P_f} {\\mathfrak{o}}_v \\times \\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} B\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\nSince ${\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ is open in $K_v$ for $v$ finite, this is an\nopen set. (Note that ${\\mathfrak{o}}_v = {\\mathcal{O}}_{K_v}$, the ring\nof algebraic integers of $K_v$).\n\nNow consider an element $x\\in U\\cap K\\subset {\\mathbb{A}}_K$. If\n$x=(x_v)$, then for $v$ finite, $x_v\\in {\\mathfrak{o}}_v$, and for $v$\ninfinite, $x_v\\in B\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Assume $x\\neq 0$. Then\n$${\\left\\lvert x_v\\right\\rvert}_v \\leq\\begin{cases} 1 & v \\text{ finite}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}<1 & v \\text{ infinite}\\end{cases}$$\nbut then\n$$\\prod {\\left\\lvert x\\right\\rvert}_v = \\prod {\\left\\lvert x_v\\right\\rvert}_v < 1$$\nin contradiction to the product formula. Thus $x=0$ and we are done.\n\nThe above theorem is very sensitive to the fact that all places are\nincluded in ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$. For example, it is clear that the image of\n${\\mathbb{A}}_K$ in $\\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} K_v$ is *dense*, since\n$K_v$ is characterized by an embedding\n$K\\hookrightarrow K_v\\cong{\\mathbb{R}},{\\mathbb{C}},{\\mathbb{Q}}_p$.\nThen by an argument familiar from Minkowski\u2019s theorem, ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$\nis a full-rank lattice in the image of $K$. But $K$ is the\n${\\mathbb{Q}}$-span of that lattice, so is dense in $K_v$.\n\nFurthermore, the same is true for the finite places:\n\nThe image of $K$ in ${\\sideset{}{'}\\prod}_{v\\in P_f} {\\mathfrak{o}}_v$\nis dense.\n\n**Proof.** Suppose\n$x=(x_v)_v\\in {\\sideset{}{'}\\prod}_{v\\in P_f} {\\mathfrak{o}}_v$. We show\nthat $x$ can be approximated as closely as desired by an element of $K$\nby showing that for any ideal $I\\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_K$, there is\n$y\\in K$ such that $y-x_v\\in I{\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ for each $v\\in P_f$.\n\nFirst multiply through by some $z$ so that everything is in\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K$: choose $z\\neq 0$ such that $zx_v\\in{\\mathfrak{o}}_v$\nfor all $v\\in P_f$. This is possible since all but finitely many $x_v$\nare already in ${\\mathfrak{o}}_v$. Thus $y-x_v\\in I{\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ is\nequivalent to $zy-zx_v\\in(zI){\\mathfrak{o}}_v\\subset I{\\mathfrak{o}}_v$.\nSo assume wlog that $x_v\\in{\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ for all $v$; in the end\nsimply divide by $z$ to recover the general case. But then the existence\nof $y$ is guaranteed by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since if\n$I=\\prod {\\mathfrak{p}}_i^{e_i}$, then\n$I{\\mathfrak{o}}_v = {\\mathfrak{p}}_i^{e_i}$ for some $i$.\n\nIt is true, though somewhat harder to prove, that $K$ is in fact dense\nin ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$ if even one place is missing from the product!\n\n${\\mathbb{A}}_K/K$ is compact.\n\n**Proof.** The set\n$$U = \\prod_{v\\in P_f}{\\mathfrak{o}}_v \\times \\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} K_v$$\nis open in ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$.\n\nClaim first that $K+U={\\mathbb{A}}_K$. Choose $(x_v)\\in {\\mathbb{A}}_K$.\nThere is a finite set $S$ of finite places $v$ such that\n$x_v\\notin {\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ for $v\\in S$. Using an argument identical\nto the approximation argument above, choose $y\\in K$ such that\n$y-x_v \\in {\\mathfrak{o}}_v, v\\in S$ and\n$y\\in{\\mathfrak{o}}_v, v\\notin S$. Then $(x_v-y)_v$ is in\n${\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ for $v\\in S$, is in ${\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ for\n$v\\notin S$ but finite, and is in $K_v$ for $v$ infinite. Thus\n$(x_v-y)_v\\in U$ and we are done.\n\nClaim next that $K\\cap U = {\\mathcal{O}}_K$. $\\supset$ is obvious. To\nsee $\\subset$, note that an element of $K\\cap U$ is an element of $K$\nthat is integral at every finite place, so it is integral and is in\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K$.\n\nThus we get a natural map\n$U\\hookrightarrow {\\mathbb{A}}_K \\twoheadrightarrow {\\mathbb{A}}_K/K$.\nThis map is surjective since $K+U={\\mathbb{A}}_K$, and its kernel is\n$K\\cap U$. So it suffices to show that $U/(K\\cap U)=U/{\\mathcal{O}}_K$\nis compact. There is obviously an exact sequence induced by the\nprojection $U\\to\\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} K_v$,\n$$\\prod_{v\\in P_f} {\\mathfrak{o}}_v\\to U/{\\mathcal{O}}_K\\to \\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}} K_v/{\\mathcal{O}}_K\\to 0$$\nThe left-hand side is compact since each ${\\mathfrak{o}}_v$ is, and the\nright-hand side is $${\\mathbb{R}}^{r_1+2r_2}/{\\mathcal{O}}_K$$ which\nknow is compact since ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ forms a full-rank lattice in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Thus $U/{\\mathcal{O}}_K$ is also compact and we are\ndone.\n\nSo we have shown that ${\\mathbb{A}}_K$ is a locally compact ring, and\nthat $K\\subset {\\mathbb{A}}_K$ is discrete and cocompact. This is\nanalogous to two other situations with which we are familiar:\n$$\\begin{gathered}\n{\\mathbb{R}}\\text{ is locally compact, }{\\mathbb{Z}}\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}\\text{ is discrete and cocompact}\\\\\n\\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}}K_v\\text{ is locally compact, }{\\mathcal{O}}_K\\subset\\prod_{v\\in P_{\\infty}}K_v\\text{ is discrete and cocompact}\\end{gathered}$$\nThis is a useful concept because in such a situation one can do Fourier\nanalysis. For example, if $f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$ is a\n$C^{\\infty}$ function with exponential decay (or at least integrable on\nall of ${\\mathbb{R}}$), then we can define its Fourier transform\n$\\hat{f}$, and the Poisson summation formula\n$$\\sum_{n\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}} f(n) = \\sum_{n\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}} \\hat{f}(n)$$\nrelates the two. The same theory thus exists for appropriately defined\nfunctions $f:{\\mathbb{A}}_K\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$, and the Poisson formula\nagain holds with the sum over $K$ rather than over ${\\mathbb{Z}}$. This\ncan be used to show that the $L$-functions have analytic continuations,\njust as the real Poisson formula is used to show this for $\\zeta$.",
