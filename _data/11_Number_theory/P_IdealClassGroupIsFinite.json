  "statement": "We give two proofs of the finiteness of the class group, one using the\nbound provided by and a second, more elementary, proof that does not\nprovide the same computational benefits as Minkowski\u2019s bound does. Both\nproofs rely on the following lemma:\n\nIf $K$ is an algebraic extension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$ and\n$0<d\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}$, then there are only a finite number of ideals of\nnorm $d$.\n\n**Proof.** The norm of a prime ideal ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ of $K$ lying over\na rational prime $p$ is $p^f$, where $f$ is the residue field degree\n$[{\\mathcal{O}}_K/{\\mathfrak{P}}{\\mathcal{O}}_K:{\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}]$,\nand there are at most $[K:{\\mathbb{Q}}]$ prime ideals lying over any\ngiven rational prime. There are thus only a finite number of\npossibilities for ideals with norm $d$ - simply factor $d$ into a\nproduct of prime powers and note that each prime power must correspond\nto one of a finite number of possibilities.\n\nThe finiteness of the class group now follows trivially from Minkowski\u2019s\ntheorem:\n\nIf $K$ is an algebraic extension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, then the class group\nof $K$, denoted $\\operatorname{Cl}(K)$, is finite.\n\n**Proof.** Minkowski\u2019s theorem guarantees that each ideal class contains\na representative integral ideal whose norm is bounded by a constant\ndepending only on the field, and the lemma shows that there are only a\nfinite number of integral ideals with norm less than that constant.\n\nMinkowski\u2019s theorem gives enough information about the size of the class\ngroup to be computationally useful in some cases (see the topic on using\nMinkowski\u2019s constant to find a class number). It does, however, require\nquite a bit of machinery. To see in a more elementary way that\n$\\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ is finite, one can proceed as follows:\n\n**Proof.** (alternate proof of theorem) By the lemma, it suffices to\nshow that there is *some* constant $C$, depending only on $K$, such that\nevery class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ has a representative\n$I\\subset{\\mathcal{O}}_K$ with $\\operatorname{N}(I)\\leq C$. For\n$u\\in K$, denote by $T_u$ the linear map left multiplication by $u$, and\nlet $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$ be a basis of ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ as a\n${\\mathbb{Z}}$-module (where $[K:{\\mathbb{Q}}]=n$). Then if\n$u=\\sum b_i(u)e_i$, it follows that\n$$\\operatorname{N}(u) = \\det(T_u)=\\det\\left(\\sum b_i(u)T_{e_i}\\right)$$\nis a polynomial of total degree at most $n$ in the $b_i(u)$, whose\ncoefficients are functions of the $T_{e_i}$ and thus depend only on $K$\n(and not on $u$). Let $C$ be the sum of the magnitude of those\ncoefficients.\n\nLet $c$ be a class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(K)$ and let\n$J\\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_K$ be a representative of the class $c^{-1}$.\nConsider\n$S=\\{\\sum_{i=1}^n r_ie_i\\ \\mid\\  1\\leq r_i\\leq \\lfloor \\operatorname{N}(J)^{1/n}+1\\rfloor\\}$.\nThe cardinality of $S$ is strictly greater than $\\operatorname{N}(J)$,\nwhile $\\lvert{\\mathcal{O}}_K/J\\rvert=\\operatorname{N}(J)$. So by the\npigenhole principle, two distinct elements of $S$ are in the same\n$J$-coset of ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$. Taking their difference, we get an\nelement $0\\neq x=\\sum b_i(x)e_i\\in J$, where not all the $b_i(x)$ are\nzero, and $\\lvert b_i(x)\\rvert \\leq \\operatorname{N}(J)^{1/n}$.\n\nNow, since $x\\in J$, using unique factorization of ideals in the\nDedekind ring ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$, we can construct an integral ideal $I$\nsuch that $IJ = (x)$, so that $I$ is in the class\n$c\\in\\operatorname{Cl}(K)$. Finally,\n$$\\operatorname{N}(I)\\operatorname{N}(J) = \\operatorname{N}(x)\\leq C(\\max(b_1(x),\\ldots,b_n(x)))^n \\leq C\\operatorname{N}(J)$$\nso that $\\operatorname{N}(I)\\leq C$.",
