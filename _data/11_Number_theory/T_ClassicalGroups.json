  "definition": "Classical Groups\n================\n\nIt is commonplace to express the classical groups with explicit\nmatrices; however, the theory and classification of classical groups can\nbenefit from a basis free consideration.\n\nGiven a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over any field $k$, the set\nof all linear transformations on $V$ is denoted $GL(V)$ and called the\n*general linear group*. We now define several significant related groups\nof $GL(V)$.\n\n\\[thm:class\\] Given a reflexive non-degenerate sesquilinear form\n$b:V\\times V\\rightarrow k$, then up to a constant $b$ is one of the\nfollowing:\n\n-   Alternating: that is $b(v,v)=0$.\n\n-   Hermitian: so $b(v,w)=b(w,v)^{\\sigma}$ where $\\sigma$ is a field\n    automorphism of $k$ of order $2$.\n\n-   Symmetric: so $b(v,w)=b(w,v)$.\n\n(Refer to [@Taylor Theorem 7.1] and [@GW Chapter V].) We prefer the\ndefinition $b(v,v)=0$ over $b(v,w)=-b(w,v)$ so that we can accommodate\nthe fields of characteristic 2. In all other characteristics these two\nproperties are equivalent.\n\nIn keeping with tradition for group theory, we let $GL(V)$ act on the\nvector space $V$ on the right hand side. This means given $v\\in V$ and\n$f\\in GL(V)$, $vf$ corresponds the vector in $V$ which $f$ sends $v$ to.\nIf one thinks of $f$ as a matrix this requires $v$ to be a row vector.\nIt is also common to consider $f$ as a function and use the notation\n$f(v)$.\n\nGiven a reflexive non-degenerate sesquilinear form\n$b:V\\times V\\rightarrow k$ we define\n$$Isom(b)=\\{f\\in GL(V):b(vf,wf)=b(v,w), v,w\\in V\\}.$$ This is called the\nisometry group of $b$ in $GL(V)$.\n\n$Isom(b)$ is a subgroup of $GL(V)$.\n\nGiven $f,g\\in Isom(b)$, $v,w\\in V$ then\n$$b(v(fg),w(fg))=b((vf)g,(wf)g)=b(vf,wf)=b(v,w).$$ Hence\n$fg\\in Isom(b)$. Clearly $1\\in Isom(b)$ as well. Finally,\n$$b(vf^{-1},wf^{-1})=b((vf^{-1})f,(wf^{-1})f)=b(v,w).$$ So\n$f^{-1}\\in Isom(b)$ and $Isom(b)$ is a subgroup of $GL(V)$.\n\nNow if we return to Theorem \\[thm:class\\] we find that there are only\nthree isometry group types, as there are only three types of reflexive\nnon-degenerate sesquilinear forms. These receive the well-known names:\n\n-   Symplectic group $Sp(V, b)$ if $b$ is alternating.\n\n-   Unitary group $U(V,b)$ if $b$ is hermitian.\n\n-   Orthogonal group $O(V,b)$ if $b$ is symmetric.\n\nA vector space $V$ equipped with a reflexive non-degenerated\nsesquilinear form $b$ is also given the designation symplectic, unitary,\nand orthogonal based on the classification of the form.\n\nBecause symplectic spaces have a standard hyperbolic basis it follows\nevery symplectic group over a vector space of the same dimension is\nisometric, meaning isomorphic as vector spaces but with an isomorphism\nwhich respects the forms. Thus we can write $Sp(V)$ instead of\n$Sp(V,b)$. For unitary and orthogonal groups more care is required.\n\nA *classical group* is any one of the family of groups derived from\nthese three and the general linear group.\n\nClassical Groups as Matrices\n============================\n\nWhen expressing these groups with matrices it becomes necessary to\nestablish the bilinear forms with matrices. Given any $n\\times n$-matrix\n$B$ over some field $k$, and row vectors $v,w\\in k^n$ we have a\nreflexive bilinear form defined by $$b(v,w)=vBw^t.$$ Whence $b$ is\nnon-degenerate if and only if $\\det B\\neq 0$.\n\nThe most common example is the identity matrix $B=I_n$. For then\n$$b(v,w)=vw^t$$ is the usual dot product, only perhaps without the\npositive definite axiom which makes sense only for ordered fields like\nthe rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$ and reals $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe isometry group of $I$ is nothing more than the invertible matrices\n$A$ where $$AIA^t=I;\\qquad AA^t=I.$$ Thus it is common for $O(n)$ to\ndenote the orthogonal group over $\\mathbb{R}$ and be given by\n$$O(n)=\\{A\\in GL(n):AA^t=I\\}.$$\n\nFor symplectic groups the form is the typical\n$J=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & I\\\\ -I & 0\\end{bmatrix}$ matrix found in the\ndefinition of symplectic matrices. Hence the isometry condition for an\nalternating form $$b(vA,wA)=vAJA^t w^t=vJw^t=b(v,w)$$ show that\n$AJA^t=J$. Thus it is common to define\n$$Sp(2m)=\\{A\\in GL(2m): AJA^t=J\\}.$$ Thus the symplectic matrices form a\ngroup of isometries.\n\nSpecial subgroups\n=================\n\nThe commutator of $GL(V)$ is the special linear group $SL(V)$ composed\nof all invertible linear transformations of determinant 1. Given a\nreflexive non-degenerate sesquilinear form $b$ on $V$, we can create the\ngroups $$SIsom(V,b)=Isom(V,b){\\cap}SL(V).$$ These get the names\n$$Sp(V),\\quad SU(V,b), \\textnormal{ and } SO(V,b).$$ Notice that\n$Sp(V)\\leq SL(V)$ so we do not require a new name.\n\nProjective groups\n=================\n\nThe projective geometry of a vector space $V$, denoted $PG(V)$ is its\nlattice of subspaces. Clearly invertible linear maps act on the\nprojective geometry because they send points (1-dimensional subspaces)\nto points, and lines (2-dimensional subspaces) to lines, and in general\n$m$-dimensional subspaces to other $m$-dimensional subspaces.\n\nHowever, the scalar transformations, i.e.: those $f\\in GL(V)$ such that\n$vf=v\\lambda$ for some fixed $\\lambda\\in k$, do not move any of the\nsubspaces of $V$ \u2013 they fix $PG(V)$. Therefore when we consider the\naction of $GL(V)$ on $PG(V)$ we factor out the kernel of the action \u2013\nthat is the scalar transforms (matrices.) We denote this group by\n$PGL(V)$. Because scalar matrices commute with all other, and not other\nmatrices do, we notice this is the same as factoring by the center\n$Z(GL(V))$.\n\nImmediately this gives rise the projective versions of each of the\nclassical groups: Let $Z=Z(GL(V))$ \u2013 the set of scalar transformations\n(a group isomorphic to $k^\\times$.)\n\n-   $PGL(V)=GL(V)/Z$, $PSL(V)=SL(V)/(Z{\\cap}SL(V))$\n\n-   $PSp(V)=Sp(V)/(Z{\\cap}Sp(V))$\n\n-   $PU(V)=U(V,b)/(Z{\\cap}U(V,b))$, $PSU(V,b)=SU(V,b)/(Z{\\cap}SU(V,b))$\n\n-   $PO(V)=O(V,b)/(Z{\\cap}O(V,b))$, $PSO(V,b)=SO(V,b)/(Z{\\cap}SO(V,b))$\n\nMost of the time the projective special isometry groups are simple\ngroups. The exceptions arise for small dimensional vector spaces and/or\nsmall fields, or with the orthogonal groups.\n\n[10]{}\n\nGruenberg, K.
