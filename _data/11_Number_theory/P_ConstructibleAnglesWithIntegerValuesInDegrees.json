  "statement": "The aim is to characterize all constructible angles with straightedge\nand compass whose value is an integer number of degrees (like\n$60\\sp\\circ$ or $36\\sp\\circ$). From now on, every time we refer to the\nmeasurement of an angle, it is meant to be in degrees, not radians.\n\nWe need two short lemmas:\n\nIf an angle measuring $x$ degrees can be constructed, then angles\nmeasuring $$\\frac x2,\\frac x4,\\frac x8,\\ldots,\\frac{x}{2\\sp k}$$ can be\nconstructed.\n\nNotice that we are not stating all of them have integer values, only\nconstructibility. The proof follows almost inmediately by knowing any\nangle can be bisected with ruler and compass.\n\nIf an angle measuring $x$ degrees can be constructed, then angles\nmeasuring any integer multiple of $x$, that is, $2x,3x,4x,\\ldots$ can be\nconstructed\n\nIf you can construct $x$, you can construct again an adjacent angle with\nthe same value and you will have constructed an angle measuring $2x$.\nRepeat the procedure and you get $3x,4x,\\ldots$.\n\nNow, a theorem.\n\nThe angle measuring $3\\sp\\circ$ can be constructed.\n\nIt is well known that both regular pentagon and equilateral triangle can\nbe built with ruler and compass. That allows us to construct angles\nmeasuring $72\\sp\\circ$ and $60\\sp\\circ$.\n\nBy first lemma we can construct then\n$$72\\sp\\circ, \\frac{72\\sp\\circ}{2}=36\\sp\\circ, \\frac{36\\sp\\circ}{2}=18\\sp\\circ,\n\\frac{18\\sp\\circ}{2}=9\\sp\\circ,\\\n\\frac{9\\sp\\circ}{2}=4.5\\sp\\circ=4\\sp\\circ\\, 30'$$ and also we can\nconstruct $$60\\sp\\circ,\\frac{60\\sp\\circ}{2}=30\\sp\\circ,\n\\frac{30\\sp\\circ}{2}=15\\sp\\circ,\n\\frac{15\\sp\\circ}{2}=7.5\\sp\\circ = 7\\sp\\circ\\, 30'$$\n\nBut if we can construct $4\\sp\\circ\\ 30'$ and $7\\sp\\circ\\ 30'$ we can\nthen construct their difference, which is exactly $3\\sp\\circ$.\n\nAlternative (J. Pahikkala): Since $72\\sp\\circ$ and $60\\sp\\circ$ can be\nconstructed, $12\\sp\\circ=72\\sp\\circ-60\\sp\\circ$ can be also constructed.\nBisecting $12\\sp\\circ$ gives $6\\sp\\circ$ and bisecting again shows that\n$3\\sp\\circ$ can be constructed.\n\nWe can construct any angle measuring an integer multiple of $3\\sp\\circ$.\n\nThe proof follows directly from the second Lemma.\n\nThe only constructible angles measuring an integer number of degrees are\nprecisely the multiples of $3\\sp\\circ$.\n\nWe are only left to prove we cannot construct any other integer value.\nWe will work by contradiction.\n\nSuppose we are able to construct with ruler and compass an angle\nmeasuring $t\\sp\\circ$ with $t$ integer and $t$ not multiple of $3$.\n\nSince $3$ does not divide $t$ and $3$ is prime, it follows that $3$ and\n$t$ are coprime, that is, $ \\gcd(3,t)=1$.\n\nBut then, by Euclid\u2019s algorithm we can find integers $m,n$ so that\n$3m-tn=1$ ($n$ or $m$ could be negative).\n\nBy the second lemma, we can construct both $3m\\sp\\circ$ and\n$tn\\sp\\circ$, so we can construct their sum (or difference), which would\nprove $1\\sp\\circ$ is constructible, and therefore any angle equal to an\ninteger number of degrees could be constructed with ruler and compass.\n\nHowever, the standard proof of the impossibility of trisecting an\narbitrary angle goes by proving $20\\sp\\circ$ cannot be constructed with\nruler and compass, this contradicts what we just showed, and therefore\nonly angles being an integer multiple of $3\\sp\\circ$ can be constructed.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nFor a more general proof for other real values besides integers, see the\ntheorem on constructible angles.",
