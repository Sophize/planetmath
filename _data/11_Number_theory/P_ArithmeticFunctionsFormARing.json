  "statement": "The set $\\mathcal{S}$ of arithmetic functions forms a commutative ring\nwith unity under the operations of element-by-element addition and\nDirichlet convolution, i.e. under $$\\begin{aligned}\n(f+g)(n)&=f(n)+g(n)\\\\\n(f*g)(n)&=\\sum_{d|n} f(d)g\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$ The\n$0$ of the ring is the function $z$ such that $z(n)=0$ for all positive\nintegers $n$, the $1$ of the ring is the convolution identity function\n$\\varepsilon$, and the units of the ring are those arithmetic functions\n$f$ such that $f(1)\\neq 0$.\n\n**Proof.** This is essentially a triviality and a little bit of\ncomputation.\n\nThat $\\mathcal{S}$ is an abelian group under $+$ is obvious; the only\ninteresting is noting that indeed $z$ is the identity of the group (the\n$0$ of the ring).\n\nMany of the ring identities are also obvious. We will prove that\n$\\varepsilon$ is the multiplicative identity, that $*$ is commutative\nand associative, that $*$ distributes over $+$, and that the units of\nthe ring are as stated.\n\nTo see that $\\varepsilon$ is the multiplicative identity, note that\n$$(\\varepsilon*f)(n)=\\sum_{d|n} \\varepsilon(d)f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=\\varepsilon(1)f(n)=f(n)$$\nand thus $\\varepsilon*f=f$.\n\nTo see that $*$ is commutative, note that $f*g$ can also be written as\n$$(f*g)(n)=\\sum_{ab=n}f(a)g(b)$$ Commutativity is obvious from this of\nthe operation.\n\nAssociativity follows similarly. Note that\n$$((f*g)*h)(n)= \\sum_{ra=n}(f*g)(r)h(a)=\\sum_{ra=n}h(a)\\sum_{bc=r}f(b)g(c)=\\sum_{abc=n}f(b)g(c)h(a)$$\nIf one expands $(f*(g*h))(n)$ similarly, the resulting sum is identical,\nso the two are equal.\n\nDistributivity follows since $$\\begin{gathered}\n(f*(g+h))(n)=\\sum_{d|n}f(d)\\left(g+h\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=\\sum_{d|n}f(d)\\left(g\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)+h\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)\\right)=\\\\\n\\sum_{d|n}f(d)g\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)+\\sum_{d|n}f(d)h\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=((f*g)+(f*h))(n)\\end{gathered}$$\n\nThe units of the ring are simply the invertible functions; the entry on\nconvolution inverses for arithmetic functions shows that the invertible\nfunctions are those functions $f$ with $f(1)\\neq 0$.",
