  "definition": "In general, let $K$ be any field. Write ${\\overline{K}}$ for a separable\nclosure of $K$, and $G_K$ for the absolute Galois group\n${\\mathrm{Gal}}({\\overline{K}}/K)$ of $K$. Let $A$ be a (Hausdorff)\nAbelian topological group. Then an ($A$-valued) Galois representation\nfor $K$ is a continuous homomorphism\n$$\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(A),$$ where we endow $G_K$ with\nthe Krull topology, and where ${\\mathrm{Aut}}(A)$ is the group of\ncontinuous automorphisms of $A$, endowed with the compact-open topology.\nOne calls $A$ the representation space for $\\rho$.\n\nThe simplest case is where $A = {\\mathbb{C}}^n$, the group of\n$n \\times 1$ column vectors with complex entries. Then\n${\\mathrm{Aut}}({\\mathbb{C}}^n) = {\\mathrm{GL}}_n({\\mathbb{C}})$, and we\nhave what is usually called a complex representation of degree $n$. In\nthe same manner, letting $A = F^n$, with $F$ any field (such as\n${\\mathbb{R}}$ or a finite field ${\\mathbb{F}}_q$) we obtain the usual\ndefinition of a degree $n$ representation over $F$.\\\nThere is an alternate definition which we should also mention. Write\n${\\mathbb{Z}}[G_K]$ for the group ring of $G_K$ with coefficients in\n${\\mathbb{Z}}$. Then a Galois representation for $K$ is simply a\ncontinuous ${\\mathbb{Z}}[G_K]$-module $A$ (i.e. the action of $G_K$ on\n$A$ is given by a continuous homomorphism $\\rho$). In other words, all\nthe information in a representation $\\rho$ is preserved in considering\nthe representation space $A$ as a continuous ${\\mathbb{Z}}[G_K]$-module.\nThe equivalence of these two definitions is as described in the entry\nfor the group algebra.\n\nWhen $A$ is complete, the continuity requirement is equivalent to the\naction of ${\\mathbb{Z}}[G_K]$ on $A$ naturally extending to a\n${\\mathbb{Z}}[\\![G_K]\\!]$-module structure on $A$. The notation\n${\\mathbb{Z}}[\\![G_K]\\!]$ denotes the completed group ring:\n$${\\mathbb{Z}}[\\![G]\\!] = {\\mathop{\\lim_{\\longleftarrow}}}_H {\\mathbb{Z}}[G/H],$$\nwhere $G$ is any profinite group, and $H$ ranges over all normal\nsubgroups of finite index.\\\nA notation we will be using often is the following. Suppose $G$ is a\ngroup, $\\rho {\\colon}G \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(A)$ is a representation and\n$H \\subseteq G$ a subgroup. Then we let\n$$A^H = \\{a \\in A \\mid \\rho(h)a = a,\\ \\mathrm{for\\ all\\ }h \\in H\\},$$\nthe subgroup of $A$ fixed pointwise by $H$.\\\nGiven a Galois representation $\\rho$, let $G_0 = \\ker \\rho$. By the\nfundamental theorem of infinite Galois theory, since $G_0$ is a closed\nnormal subgroup of $G_K$, it corresponds to a certain normal subfield of\n${\\overline{K}}$. Naturally, this is the fixed field of $G_0$, and we\ndenote it by $K(\\rho)$. (The notation becomes better justified after we\nview some examples.) Notice that since $\\rho$ is trivial on\n$G_0 = {\\mathrm{Gal}}({\\overline{K}}/K(\\rho))$, it factors through a\nrepresentation\n$${\\widetilde{\\rho}} {\\colon}{\\mathrm{Gal}}(K(\\rho)/K) \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(A),$$\nwhich is faithful. This property characterizes $K(\\rho)$.\n\nIn the case $A = {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ or $A = {\\mathbb{C}}^n$, the so-called\n\u201cno small subgroups\u201d argument implies that the image of $G_K$ is finite.\n\nFor a first application of definition, we say that $\\rho$ is discrete if\nfor all $a \\in A$, the stabilizer of $a$ in $G_K$ is open in $G_K$. This\nis the case when $A$ is given the discrete topology, such as when $A$ is\nfinite and Hausdorff. The stabilizer of any $a \\in A$ fixes a\n[*finite*]{} extension of $K$, which we denote by $K(a)$. One has that\n$K(\\rho)$ is the union of all the $K(a)$.\n\nAs a second application, suppose that the image $\\rho(G_K)$ is Abelian.\nThen the quotient $G_K/G_0$ is Abelian, so $G_0$ contains the commutator\nsubgroup of $G_K$, which means that $K(\\rho)$ is contained in\n$K^{\\mathrm{ab}}$, the maximal Abelian extension of $K$. This is the\ncase when $\\rho$ is a character, i.e. a $1$-dimensional representation\nover some (commutative unital) ring,\n$$\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to {\\mathrm{GL}}_1(A) = A^\\times.$$\n\n\u00a0\\\nAssociated to any field $K$ are two basic Galois representations, namely\nthose with representation spaces $A = L$ and $A = L^\\times$, for any\nnormal intermediate field $K \\subseteq L \\subseteq {\\overline{K}}$, with\nthe usual action of the Galois group on them. Both of these\nrepresentations are discrete. The additive representation is rather\nsimple if $L/K$ is finite: by the normal basis theorem, it is merely a\npermutation representation on the normal basis. Also, if\n$L = {\\overline{K}}$ and $x \\in {\\overline{K}}$, then $K(x)$, the field\nobtained by adjoining $x$ to $K$, agrees with the fixed field of the\nstabilizer of $x$ in $G_K$. This motivates the notation \u201c$K(a)$\u201d\nintroduced above.\n\nBy contrast, in general, $L^\\times$ can become a rather complicated\nobject. To look at just a piece of the representation $L^\\times$, assume\nthat $L$ contains the group $\\mu_m$ of $m$-th roots of unity, where $m$\nis prime to the characteristic of $K$. Then we let $A = \\mu_m$. It is\npossible to choose an isomorphism of Abelian groups\n$\\mu_m \\cong {\\mathbb{Z}}/m$, and it follows that our representation is\n$\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to ({\\mathbb{Z}}/m)^\\times$. Now assume that $m$ has\nthe form $p^n$, where $p$ is a prime not equal to the characteristic,\nand set $A_n = \\mu_{p^n}$. This gives a sequence of representations\n$\\rho_n {\\colon}G_K \\to ({\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n)^\\times$, which are compatible\nwith the natural maps\n$({\\mathbb{Z}}/p^{n+1})^\\times \\to ({\\mathbb{Z}}/p^n)^\\times$. This\ncompatibility allows us to glue them together into a big representation\n$$\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(T_p\\mathbb{G}_m) \\cong {\\mathbb{Z}}_p^\\times,$$\ncalled the $p$-adic cyclotomic representation of $K$. This\nrepresentation is often not discrete. The notation $T_p\\mathbb{G}_m$\nwill be explained below.\n\nThis example may be generalized as follows. Let $B$ be an Abelian\nalgebraic group defined over $K$. For each integer $n$, let\n$B_n = B({\\overline{K}})[p^n]$ be the set of ${\\overline{K}}$-rational\npoints whose order divides $p^n$. Then we define the $p$-adic Tate\nmodule of $B$ via $$T_pB = {\\mathop{\\lim_{\\longleftarrow}}}_n B_n.$$ It\nacquires a natural Galois action from the ones on the $B_n$. The two\nmost commonly treated examples of this are the cases $B = \\mathbb{G}_m$\n(the multiplicative group, giving the cyclotomic representation above)\nand $B = E$, an elliptic curve defined over $K$.\\\nThe last thing which we shall mention about generalities is that to any\nGalois representation $\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(A)$, one may\nassociate the Galois cohomology groups $H^n(K,\\rho)$, more commonly\nwritten $H^n(K,A)$, which are defined to be the group cohomology of\n$G_K$ (computed with continuous cochains) with coefficients in $A$.\\\nGalois representations play a fundamental role in algebraic number\ntheory, as many objects and properties related to global fields and\nlocal fields may be determined by certain Galois representations and\ntheir properties. We shall describe the local case first, and then the\nglobal case.\\\nLet $K$ be a local field, by which we mean the fraction field of a\ncomplete DVR with finite residue field. We write $v_K$ for the\nnormalized valuation, ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ for the associated DVR,\n${\\mathfrak{m}}_K$ for the maximal ideal of ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$,\n$k_K = {\\mathcal{O}}_K/{\\mathfrak{m}}_K$ for the residue field, and\n$\\ell$ for the characteristic of $k_K$.\n\nLet $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension, and define $v_L$,\n${\\mathcal{O}}_L$, ${\\mathfrak{m}}_L$, and $k_L$ accordingly. There is a\nnatural surjection ${\\mathrm{Gal}}(L/K) \\to {\\mathrm{Gal}}(k_L/k_K)$. We\ncall the kernel of this map the inertia group, and write it\n$I(L/K) = \\ker({\\mathrm{Gal}}(L/K) \\to {\\mathrm{Gal}}(k_L/k_K))$.\nFurther, the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $I(L/K)$ is normal, and we call it\nthe wild ramification group, and denote it by $W(L/K)$. One calls $I/W$\nthe tame ramification group.\n\nIt happens that the formation of these group is compatible with\nextensions $L'/L/K$, in that we have surjections $I(L'/K) \\to I(L/K)$\nand $W(L'/K) \\to W(L/K)$. This lets us define\n$W_K \\subset I_K \\subset G_K$ to be the inverse limits of the subgroups\n$W(L/K) \\subseteq I(L/K) \\subseteq {\\mathrm{Gal}}(L/K)$, $L$ as usual\nranging over all finite Galois extensions of $K$ in ${\\overline{K}}$.\n\nLet $\\rho$ be a Galois representation for $K$ with representation space\n$A$. We say that $\\rho$ is unramified if the inertia group $I_K$ acts\ntrivially on $A$, or in other words $I_K \\subseteq \\ker \\rho$ or\n$A^{I_K} = A$. Otherwise we say it is ramified. Similarly, we say that\n$\\rho$ is (at most) tamely ramified if the wild ramification group acts\ntrivially, or $W_K \\subseteq \\ker \\rho$, or $A^{W_K} = A$; and if not we\nsay it is wildly ramified.\n\nWe let $K_{\\mathrm{ur}}= {\\overline{K}}^{I_K}$ be the maximal unramified\nextension of $K$, and $K_\\mathrm{tame} = {\\overline{K}}^{W_K}$ be the\nmaximal tamely ramified extension of $K$.\n\nUnramified or tamely ramified extensions are usually much easier to\nstudy than wildly ramified extensions. In the unramified case, it\nresults from the fact that\n$G_K/I_K \\cong G_{k(K)} \\cong {\\widehat{{\\mathbb{Z}}}}$ is pro-cyclic.\nThus an unramified representation is completely determined by the action\nof $\\rho(\\sigma)$ for a topological generator $\\sigma$ of $G_K/I_K$.\n(Such a $\\sigma$ is often called a Frobenius element.)\n\nGiven a finite extension $L/K$, one defines the inertia degree\n$f_{L/K} = [k_L:k_K]$ and the ramification degree\n$e_{L/K} = [v_L(L^\\times):v_L(K^\\times)]$ as usual. Then in the Galois\ncase one may recover them as $f_{L/K} = [{\\mathrm{Gal}}(L/K):I(L/K)]$\nand $e_{L/K} = \\#I(L/K)$. The tame inertia degree, which is the\nnon-$p$-part of $e_{L/K}$, is equal to $[I(L/K):W(L/K)]$, while the wild\ninertia degree, which is the $p$-part of $e_{L/K}$, is equal to\n$\\#W(L/K)$.\n\nOne finds that the inertia and ramification properties of $L/K$ may be\ncomputed from the ramification properties of the Galois representation\n${\\mathcal{O}}_L$.\\\nWe now turn to global fields. We shall only treat the number field case.\nThus we let $K$ be a finite extension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, and write\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ for its ring of integers. For each place $v$ of $K$,\nwrite $K_v$ for the completion of $K$ with respect to $v$. When $v$ is a\nfinite place, we write simply $v$ for its associated normalized\nvaluation, ${\\mathcal{O}}_v$ for ${\\mathcal{O}}_{K_v}$,\n${\\mathfrak{m}}_v$ for ${\\mathfrak{m}}_{K_v}$, $k_v$ for $k_{K_v}$, and\n$\\ell(v)$ for the characteristic of $k_v$.\n\nFor each place $v$, fix an algebraic closure ${\\overline{K}}_v$ of\n$K_v$. Furthermore, choose an embedding\n${\\overline{K}} \\hookrightarrow {\\overline{K}}_v$. This choice is\nequivalent to choosing an extension of $v$ to all of\n${\\overline{K}}^\\times$, and to choosing an embedding\n$G_{K_v} \\hookrightarrow G_K$. We denote the image of this last\nembedding by $G_v \\subset G_K$; it is called a decomposition group at\n$v$. Sitting inside $G_v$ are two groups, $I_v$ and $W_v$, corresponding\nto the inertia and wild ramification subgroups $I_{K_v}$ and $W_{K_v}$\nof $G_{K_v}$; we call the images $I_v$ and $W_v$ the inertia group at\n$v$ and the wild ramification group at $v$, respectively.\n\nFor a Galois representation $\\rho {\\colon}G_K \\to {\\mathrm{Aut}}(A)$ and\na place $v$, it is profitable to consider the restricted representation\n$\\rho_v = \\rho|_{G_v}$. One calls $\\rho$ a global representation, and\n$\\rho_v$ a local representation. We say that $\\rho$ is ramified or\ntamely ramified (or not) at $v$ if $\\rho_v$ is (or isn\u2019t). The\nTchebotarev density theorem implies that the corresponding Frobenius\nelements $\\sigma_v \\in G_v$ are dense in $G_K$, so that the union of the\n$G_v$ is dense in $G_K$. Therefore, it is reasonable to try to reduce\nquestions about $\\rho$ to questions about all the $\\rho_v$\nindependently. This is a manifestation of Hasse\u2019s local-to-global\nprinciple.\n\nGiven a global Galois representation with representation space\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_p^n$ which is unramified at all but finitely many places\n$v$, it is a goal of number theory to prove that it arises naturally in\narithmetic geometry (namely, as a subrepresentation of an \u00e9tale\ncohomology group of a motive), and also to prove that it arises from an\nautomorphic form. This can only be shown in certain special cases.",
