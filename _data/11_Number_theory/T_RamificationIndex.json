  "definition": "Ramification in number fields\n=============================\n\n\\[definition-1\\] Let $L/K$ be an extension of number fields. Let\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ be a nonzero prime ideal in the ring of integers\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ of $K$, and suppose the ideal\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L \\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_L$ factors as\n$${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L = \\prod_{i=1}^n {{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i^{e_i}$$\nfor some prime ideals ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i \\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_L$ and\nexponents $e_i \\in\n{\\mathbb{N}}$. The natural number $e_i$ is called the [*ramification\nindex*]{} of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$. It is often\ndenoted $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$. If $e_i > 1$ for any\n$i$, then we say the ideal ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ [*ramifies*]{} in $L$.\n\nLikewise, if ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ is a nonzero prime ideal in\n${\\mathcal{O}}_L$, and\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}:= {{\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\cap}{\\mathcal{O}}_K$, then we say\n${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ [*ramifies*]{} over $K$ if the ramification index\n$e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ in the\nfactorization of the ideal\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L \\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_L$ is greater\nthan 1. That is, a prime ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ in ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$\nramifies in $L$ if at least one prime ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ dividing\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L$ ramifies over $K$. If $L/K$ is a\nGalois extension, then the ramification indices of all the primes\ndividing ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L$ are equal, since the Galois\ngroup is transitive on this set of primes.\n\nThe local view\n--------------\n\nThe phenomenon of ramification has an equivalent interpretation in terms\nof local rings. With $L/K$ as before, let ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ be a prime\nin ${\\mathcal{O}}_L$ with\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}:= {{\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\cap}{\\mathcal{O}}_K$. Then the\ninduced map of localizations\n$({\\mathcal{O}}_K)_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}\\hookrightarrow ({\\mathcal{O}}_L)_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$\nis a local homomorphism of local rings (in fact, of discrete valuation\nrings), and the ramification index of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ is the unique natural number $e$ such that\n$${{\\mathfrak{p}}}({\\mathcal{O}}_L)_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}= ({{\\mathfrak{P}}}({\\mathcal{O}}_L)_{{\\mathfrak{P}}})^e \\subset ({\\mathcal{O}}_L)_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}.$$\n\nAn astute reader may notice that this formulation of ramification index\ndoes not require that $L$ and $K$ be number fields, or even that they\nplay any role at all. We take advantage of this fact here to give a\nsecond, more general definition.\n\n\\[definition-2\\] Let $\\iota: A {\\longrightarrow}B$ be any ring\nhomomorphism. Suppose ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\subset B$ is a prime ideal such\nthat the localization $B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ of $B$ at ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$\nis a discrete valuation ring. Let ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ be the prime ideal\n$\\iota^{-1}({{\\mathfrak{P}}})\n\\subset A$, so that $\\iota$ induces a local homomorphism\n$\\iota_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}:\nA_{{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\longrightarrow}B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}$. Then the\n[*ramification index*]{} $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ is\ndefined to be the unique natural number such that\n$$\\iota({{\\mathfrak{p}}})B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}= ({{\\mathfrak{P}}}B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}})^{e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})} \\subset B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}},$$\nor $\\infty$ if $\\iota({{\\mathfrak{p}}})B_{{\\mathfrak{P}}}= (0)$.\n\nThe reader who is not interested in local rings may assume that $A$ and\n$B$ are unique factorization domains, in which case\n$e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ is the exponent of\n${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ in the factorization of the ideal\n$\\iota({{\\mathfrak{p}}}) B$, just as in our first definition (but\nwithout the requirement that the rings $A$ and $B$ originate from number\nfields).\n\nThere is of course much more that can be said about ramification indices\neven in this purely algebraic setting, but we limit ourselves to the\nfollowing remarks:\n\n1.  Suppose $A$ and $B$ are themselves discrete valuation rings, with\n    respective maximal ideals ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$.\n    Let\n    $\\hat{A} := {\\,\\underset{\\longleftarrow}{\\lim}\\,}A/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}^n$\n    and\n    $\\hat{B} := {\\,\\underset{\\longleftarrow}{\\lim}\\,}B/{{\\mathfrak{P}}}^n$\n    be the completions of $A$ and $B$ with respect to ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\n    and ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$. Then $$\\label{completion}\n    e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) = e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}\\hat{B}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}\\hat{A}).$$\n    In other words, the ramification index of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ in the $A$\u2013algebra $B$ equals the ramification\n    index in the completions of $A$ and $B$ with respect to\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$.\n\n2.  Suppose $A$ and $B$ are Dedekind domains, with respective fraction\n    fields $K$ and $L$. If $B$ equals the integral closure of $A$ in\n    $L$, then $$\\label{sum-formula}\n    \\sum_{{{\\mathfrak{P}}}{\\mid}{{\\mathfrak{p}}}} e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) \\leq [L:K],$$\n    where ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ ranges over all prime ideals in $B$ that\n    divide ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}B$, and\n    $f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}) := \\dim_{A/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}}(B/{{\\mathfrak{P}}})$\n    is the inertial degree of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ over\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$. Equality holds in Equation\u00a0 whenever $B$ is\n    finitely generated as an $A$\u2013module.\n\nRamification in algebraic geometry\n==================================\n\nThe word \u201cramify\u201d in English means \u201cto divide into two or more\nbranches,\u201d and we will show in this section that the mathematical term\nlives up to its common English meaning.\n\n\\[algebraic\\] Let $f: C_1 {\\longrightarrow}C_2$ be a non\u2013constant\nregular morphism of curves (by which we mean one dimensional nonsingular\nirreducible algebraic varieties) over an algebraically closed field $k$.\nThen $f$ has a nonzero degree $n := \\deg f$, which can be defined in any\nof the following ways:\n\n-   The number of points in a generic fiber $f^{-1}(p)$, for $p \\in\n    C_2$\n\n-   The maximum number of points in $f^{-1}(p)$, for $p \\in C_2$\n\n-   The degree of the extension $k(C_1)/f^* k(C_2)$ of function fields\n\nThere is a finite set of points $p \\in C_2$ for which the inverse image\n$f^{-1}(p)$ does not have size $n$, and we call these points the\n[*branch points*]{} or [*ramification points*]{} of $f$. If $P \\in\nC_1$ with $f(P) = p$, then the [*ramification index*]{} $e(P/p)$ of $f$\nat $P$ is the ramification index obtained algebraically from\nDefinition\u00a0\\[definition-2\\] by taking\n\n-   $A = k[C_2]_p$, the local ring consisting of all rational functions\n    in the function field $k(C_2)$ which are regular at $p$.\n\n-   $B = k[C_1]_P$, the local ring consisting of all rational functions\n    in the function field $k(C_1)$ which are regular at $P$.\n\n-   ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}= {{\\mathfrak{m}}}_p$, the maximal ideal in $A$\n    consisting of all functions which vanish at $p$.\n\n-   ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}= {{\\mathfrak{m}}}_P$, the maximal ideal in $B$\n    consisting of all functions which vanish at $P$.\n\n-   $\\iota = f^*_p: k[C_2]_p \\hookrightarrow k[C_1]_P$, the map on the\n    function fields induced by the morphism $f$.\n\n\\[example-1\\] The picture in Figure\u00a0\\[parabola-figure\\] may be worth a\nthousand words. Let $k = {\\mathbb{C}}$ and\n$C_1 = C_2 = {\\mathbb{C}}= {\\mathbb{A}}^1_{\\mathbb{C}}$. Take the map\n$f: {\\mathbb{C}}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{C}}$ given by $f(y) = y^2$.\nThen $f$ is plainly a map of degree 2, and every point in $C_2$ except\nfor 0 has two preimages in $C_1$. The point 0 is thus a ramification\npoint of $f$ of index 2, and we have drawn the graph of $f$ near $0$.\n\nNote that we have only drawn the real locus of $f$ because that is all\nthat can fit into two dimensions. We see from the figure that a typical\npoint on $C_2$ such as the point $x = 1$ has two points in $C_1$ which\nmap to it, but that the point $x = 0$ has only one corresponding point\nof $C_1$ which \u201cbranches\u201d or \u201cramifies\u201d into two distinct points of\n$C_1$ whenever one moves away from 0.\n\nRelation to the number field case\n---------------------------------\n\nThe relationship between Definition\u00a0\\[definition-2\\] and\nDefinition\u00a0\\[algebraic\\] is easiest to explain in the case where $f$ is\na map between affine varieties. When $C_1$ and $C_2$ are affine, then\ntheir coordinate rings $k[C_1]$ and $k[C_2]$ are Dedekind domains, and\nthe points of the curve $C_1$ (respectively, $C_2$) correspond naturally\nwith the maximal ideals of the ring $k[C_1]$ (respectively, $k[C_2]$).\nThe ramification points of the curve $C_1$ are then exactly the points\nof $C_1$ which correspond to maximal ideals of $k[C_1]$ that ramify in\nthe algebraic sense, with respect to the map\n$f^*: k[C_2] {\\longrightarrow}k[C_1]$ of coordinate rings.\n\nEquation\u00a0 in this case says $$\\sum_{P \\in f^{-1}(p)} e(P/p) = n,$$ and\nwe see that the well known formula\u00a0 in number theory is simply the\nalgebraic analogue of the geometric fact that the number of points in\nthe fiber of $f$, counting multiplicities, is always $n$.\n\nLet $f: {\\mathbb{C}}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{C}}$ be given by\n$f(y) = y^2$ as in Example\u00a0\\[example-1\\]. Since $C_2$ is just the affine\nline, the coordinate ring ${\\mathbb{C}}[C_2]$ is equal to\n${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$, the polynomial ring in one variable over\n${\\mathbb{C}}$. Likewise, ${\\mathbb{C}}[C_1] = {\\mathbb{C}}[Y]$, and the\ninduced map $f^*: {\\mathbb{C}}[X] {\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{C}}[Y]$ is\nnaturally given by $f^*(X) = Y^2$. We may accordingly identify the\ncoordinate ring ${\\mathbb{C}}[C_2]$ with the subring ${\\mathbb{C}}[X^2]$\nof ${\\mathbb{C}}[X] = {\\mathbb{C}}[C_1]$.\n\nNow, the ring ${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$ is a principal ideal domain, and the\nmaximal ideals in ${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$ are exactly the principal ideals of\nthe form $(X -\na)$ for any $a \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$. Hence the nonzero prime ideals in\n${\\mathbb{C}}[X^2]$ are of the form $(X^2 - a)$, and these factor in\n${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$ as\n$$(X^2 - a) = (X - \\sqrt{a}) (X + \\sqrt{a}) \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}[X].$$\nNote that the two prime ideals $(X - \\sqrt{a})$ and $(X + \\sqrt{a})$ of\n${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$ are equal only when $a = 0$, so we see that the ideal\n$(X^2\n- a)$ in ${\\mathbb{C}}[X^2]$, corresponding to the point $a \\in C_2$,\nramifies in $C_1$ exactly when $a = 0$. We have therefore recovered our\nprevious geometric characterization of the ramified points of $f$,\nsolely in terms of the algebraic factorizations of ideals in\n${\\mathbb{C}}[X]$.\n\nIn the case where $f$ is a map between projective varieties,\nDefinition\u00a0\\[definition-2\\] does not directly apply to the coordinate\nrings of $C_1$ and $C_2$, but only to those of open covers of $C_1$ and\n$C_2$ by affine varieties. Thus we do have an instance of yet another\nnew phenomenon here, and rather than keep the reader in suspense we jump\nstraight to the final, most general definition of ramification that we\nwill give.\n\n\\[final\\] Let\n$f: (X,{\\mathcal{O}}_X) {\\longrightarrow}(Y,{\\mathcal{O}}_Y)$ be a\nmorphism of locally ringed spaces. Let $p \\in X$ and suppose that the\nstalk $({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p$ is a discrete valuation ring. Write\n$\\phi_p: ({\\mathcal{O}}_Y)_{f(p)} {\\longrightarrow}({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p$\nfor the induced map of $f$ on stalks at $p$. Then the [*ramification\nindex*]{} of $p$ over $Y$ is the unique natural number $e$, if it exists\n(or $\\infty$ if it does not exist), such that\n$$\\phi_p({{\\mathfrak{m}}}_{f(p)})({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p = {{\\mathfrak{m}}}_p^e,$$\nwhere ${{\\mathfrak{m}}}_p$ and ${{\\mathfrak{m}}}_{f(p)}$ are the\nrespective maximal ideals of $({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p$ and\n$({\\mathcal{O}}_Y)_{f(p)}$. We say $p$ is [*ramified*]{} in $Y$ if\n$e > 1$.\n\nA ring homomorphism $\\iota: A {\\longrightarrow}B$ corresponds\nfunctorially to a morphism\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(B) {\\longrightarrow}{\\operatorname{Spec}}(A)$ of\nlocally ringed spaces from the prime spectrum of $B$ to that of $A$, and\nthe algebraic notion of ramification from Definition\u00a0\\[definition-2\\]\nequals the sheaf\u2013theoretic notion of ramification from\nDefinition\u00a0\\[final\\].\n\nFor any morphism of varieties $f: C_1 {\\longrightarrow}C_2$, there is an\ninduced morphism $f^\\#$ on the structure sheaves of $C_1$ and $C_2$,\nwhich are locally ringed spaces. If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are curves, then the\nstalks are one dimensional regular local rings and therefore discrete\nvaluation rings, so in this way we recover the algebraic geometric\ndefinition (Definition\u00a0\\[algebraic\\]) from the sheaf definition\n(Definition\u00a0\\[final\\]).\n\nRamification in complex analysis\n================================\n\nRamification points or branch points in complex geometry are merely a\nspecial case of the high\u2013flown terminology of Definition\u00a0\\[final\\].\nHowever, they are important enough to merit a separate mention here.\n\n\\[analytic\\] Let $f: M {\\longrightarrow}N$ be a holomorphic map of\nRiemann surfaces. For any $p\n\\in M$, there exists local coordinate charts $U$ and $V$ around $p$ and\n$f(p)$ such that $f$ is locally the map $z \\mapsto z^e$ from $U$ to $V$.\nThe natural number $e$ is called the [*ramification index*]{} of $f$ at\n$p$, and $p$ is said to be a [*branch point*]{} or [*ramification\npoint*]{} of $f$ if $e > 1$.\n\nTake the map $f: {\\mathbb{C}}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{C}}$,\n$f(y) = y^2$ of Example\u00a0\\[example-1\\]. We study the behavior of $f$ near\nthe unramified point $y=1$ and near the ramified point $y=0$. Near\n$y=1$, take the coordinate $w = y-1$ on the domain and $v = x-1$ on the\nrange. Then $f$ maps $w+1$ to $(w+1)^2$, which in the $v$ coordinate is\n$(w+1)^2 - 1 = 2w + w^2$. If we change coordinates to $z = 2w +\nw^2$ on the domain, keeping $v$ on the range, then $f(z) = z$, so the\nramification index of $f$ at $y=1$ is equal to 1.\n\nNear $y=0$, the function $f(y) = y^2$ is already in the form $z\n\\mapsto z^e$ with $e=2$, so the ramification index of $f$ at $y=0$ is\nequal to 2.\n\nAlgebraic\u2013analytic correspondence\n---------------------------------\n\nOf course, the analytic notion of ramification given in\nDefinition\u00a0\\[analytic\\] can be couched in terms of locally ringed spaces\nas well. Any Riemann surface together with its sheaf of holomorphic\nfunctions is a locally ringed space. Furthermore the stalk at any point\nis always a discrete valuation ring, because germs of holomorphic\nfunctions have Taylor expansions making the stalk isomorphic to the\npower series ring ${\\mathbb{C}}[[z]]$. We can therefore apply\nDefinition\u00a0\\[final\\] to any holomorphic map of Riemann surfaces, and it\nis not surprising that this process yields the same results as\nDefinition\u00a0\\[analytic\\].\n\nMore generally, every map of algebraic varieties\n$f: V {\\longrightarrow}W$ can be interpreted as a holomorphic map of\nRiemann surfaces in the usual way, and the ramification points on $V$\nand $W$ under $f$ as algebraic varieties are identical to their\nramification points as Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the analytic\nstructure may be regarded in a certain sense as the \u201ccompletion\u201d of the\nalgebraic structure, and in this sense the algebraic\u2013analytic\ncorrespondence between the ramification points may be regarded as the\ngeometric version of the equality\u00a0 in number theory.\n\nThe algebraic\u2013analytic correspondence of ramification points is itself\nonly one manifestation of the wide ranging identification between\nalgebraic geometry and analytic geometry which is explained to great\neffect in the seminal paper of Serre\u00a0[@gaga].\n\n[9]{} Robin Hartshorne, [*Algebraic Geometry*]{}, Springer\u2013Verlag, 1977\n(GTM [**52**]{}).
