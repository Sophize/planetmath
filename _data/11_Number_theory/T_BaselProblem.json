  "definition": "The [*Basel problem*]{}, first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644, asks for\na finite formula for the infinite sum\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{i^2}.$$ Though Mengoli verified the\nWallis formulae for $\\pi$, it did not occur to him that $\\pi$ was also\ninvolved in the solution of this problem. Jakob Bernoulli also tried in\nvain to solve this problem. Even an approximate decimal value eluded\ncontemporary mathematicians: an answer accurate to just five decimal\nplaces requires iterating up to at least $i = 112000$, which without the\naid of a computer was wholly impractical in Mengoli\u2019s day. The problem\nwas finally solved in 1741, when, after almost a decade of work,\nLeonhard Euler conclusively proved that\n$$\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} = \\zeta(2) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{i^2}.$$ The\nvalue, 1.6449340668482264365... could then be computed to almost as many\ndecimal places as were known of $\\pi$.
