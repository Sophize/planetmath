  "definition": "A [*singly even number*]{} is an even number divisible by 2 but by no\ngreater power of two. If $n$ is a singly even number, it satisfies the\ncongruence $n \\equiv 2 \\mod 4$. The first few positive singly even\nnumbers are 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, listed in A016825 of Sloane\u2019s\nOEIS.\n\nIn the binary representation of a positive singly even number, the bit\nimmediately to the left of the least significant bit is 1 (the least\nsignificant bit itself is of course 0). Thus a single 1-bit right shift\nis enough to change the parity to odd. These properties obviously also\nhold true when representing negative numbers in binary by prefixing the\nabsolute value with a minus sign. As it turns out, all this also holds\ntrue in two\u2019s complement. Independently of binary representation, we can\nsay that the of a singly even number with $p = 2$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWith only one exception, all singly even numbers are composite. In\nrepresenting a singly even number $n$ as\n$$\\prod_{i = 1}^{\\pi(n)} {p_i}^{a_i},$$ with $p_i$ being the $i$th prime\nnumber, $a_1 = 1$, all other other $a_i$ may have any nonnegative\ninteger value.\n\nIf $n$ is singly even, then the value of $\\tau(n)$ (the divisor\nfunction) is even. In fact, $\\tau(n) = 2\\tau(\\frac{n}{2})$. This is\nbecause if the divisors of $\\frac{n}{2}$ are\n$1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots , d_{\\tau(\\frac{n}{2}) - 1}, \\frac{n}{2}$, then the\ndivisors of $n$ include all these as well as\n$2, 2d_2, 2d_3, \\ldots , 2d_{\\tau(\\frac{n}{2}) - 1}, n$. (Singly even\nnumbers therefore have an equal amount of odd divisors as they do even\ndivisors). From this it is easy to deduce the relationship of the values\nof the sum of divisors function $\\sigma(x)$ for $n$ and $\\frac{n}{2}$ is\n$\\sigma(n) = 3\\sigma(\\frac{n}{2})$. Because $\\phi(2) = 1$ ($\\phi(n)$\nbeing Euler\u2019s totient function) it is also easy to see that for $n$ a\nsingly even number it is the case that $\\phi(n) = \\phi(\\frac{n}{2})$.\n\nWhereas $(-1)^n = 1$ whether $n$ is singly or doubly even, with the\nimaginary unit $i$ it is the case that $i^n = -1$ only when $n$ is\nsingly even.\n\nPrepending a 0 to the sequence of singly even numbers gives a continued\nfraction related to the natural log base $e$ thus:\n$$\\frac{e - 1}{e + 1} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{6 + \\frac{1}{10 + \\frac{1}{14 + \\ldots}}}}$$\n\nThe multiplicative encodings of both Pascal\u2019s triangle and Losanitsch\u2019s\ntriangle consist entirely of singly even numbers.\n\nSingly even numbers also have applications in chemistry. To list just\ntwo: the maximum number of electrons in an atomic subshell is a singly\neven number; the number of polyacenes in a carbon nanotube is also a\nsingly even number.\n\n[1]{} I.
