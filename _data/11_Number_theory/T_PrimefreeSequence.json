  "definition": "Consider the sequence defined by $a_1 = 20615674205555510$,\n$a_2 = 3794765361567513$ and $a_n = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2}$ for all\n$n > 2$. As it has been verified not to contain any primes, it is called\na [*primefree sequence*]{}. The initial terms must be coprime, or else\nthe lack of primes is a trivial consequence of the initial terms sharing\na divisor other than 1.\n\nAny Fibonacci-like sequence will naturally exhibit some patterns in the\nfactorizations of its terms in relation to their indices. The initial\nterms are chosen so that these patterns cover any possible value of $n$.\nSo, for our example sequence, discovered by Wilf in 1990,\n$2|a_{3x + 1}$, $3|a_{4x + 2}$, $5|a_{5x + 1}$, $7|a_{8x}$, etc. for a\nfinite number of potential prime factors (and $x \\ge 0$ in each case).\n\nOrder is very important: switching the initial terms can cause primes to\narise in the sequence. Switching the initial terms in our example causes\n$a_{138}$ and a few others afterwards to be prime.\n\nThe example sequence is listed in A083216 of the OEIS.\n\n[3]{} P. Hoffman.
