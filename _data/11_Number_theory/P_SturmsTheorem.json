  "statement": "This root-counting theorem was produced by the French mathematician\nJacques Sturm in 1829.\n\nLet $P(x)$ be a real polynomial in $x$, and define the Sturm sequence of\npolynomials $\\big(P_0(x), P_1(x), \\ldots \\big)$ by $$\\begin{aligned}\nP_0(x) &=& P(x)\\\\\nP_1(x) &=& P'(x)\\\\\nP_n(x) &=& -\\mathrm{rem}(P_{n-2}, P_{n-1}), n \\geq 2\\end{aligned}$$ Here\n$\\mathrm{rem}(P_{n-2}, P_{n-1})$ denotes the remainder of the polynomial\n$P_{n-2}$ upon division by the polynomial $P_{n-1}$. The sequence\nterminates once one of the $P_i$ is zero.\n\nFor any number $t$, let $var_P(t)$ denote the number of sign changes in\nthe sequence $P_0(t), P_1(t), \\ldots$.\n\nFor real numbers $a$ and $b$ that are both not roots of $P(x)$,\n$$\\#\\{\\textrm{distinct real roots of }P \\textrm{ in } (a, b)\\} = var_P(a)-var_P(b)$$\n\nIn particular, we can count the total number of distinct real roots by\nlooking at the limits as $a\\rightarrow-\\infty$ and\n$b\\rightarrow+\\infty$. The total number of distinct real roots will\ndepend only on the leading terms of the Sturm sequence polynomials.\n\nNote that deg $P_n <$ deg $P_{n-1}$, and so the longest possible Sturm\nsequence has deg $P+1$ terms.\n\nAlso, note that this sequence is very closely related to the sequence of\nremainders generated by the Euclidean Algorithm; in fact, the term $P_i$\nis the exact same except with a sign changed when $i \\equiv 2$ or\n$3 \\pmod 4$. Thus, the Half-GCD Algorithm may be used to compute this\nsequence. Be aware that some computer algebra systems may normalize\nremainders from the Euclidean Algorithm which messes up the sign.\n\nFor a proof, see Wolpert, N., \u201c \u201d",
