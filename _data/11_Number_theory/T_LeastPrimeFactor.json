  "definition": "The [*least prime factor*]{} of a positive integer $n$ is the smallest\npositive prime number dividing $n$. Sometimes expressed as a function,\n${\\textrm{lpf}}(n)$. For example, ${\\textrm{lpf}}(91) = 7$. For a prime\nnumber $p$, clearly ${\\textrm{lpf}}(p) = p$, while for any composite\nnumber (except squares of primes) $({\\textrm{lpf}}(n))^2 < n$. (The\nfunction would be quite useless if 1 is considered a prime, therefore\n${\\textrm{lpf}}(1)$ is undefined \u2014 though we could make an argument for\n${\\textrm{lpf}}(0) = 2$). In the sequence of least prime factors for\neach integer in turn, each prime occurs first at the index for itself\nthen not again until its square.\n\nIn Mathematica, one can use `LeastPrimeFactor[n]` after loading a number\ntheory package, or much more simply by using the command\n`FactorInteger[n][[1,1]]` (of course substituting `n` as necessary).",
