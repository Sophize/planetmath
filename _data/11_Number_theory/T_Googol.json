  "definition": "A *googol* equals to the number $10^{100}$, that is, a one followed by\none hundred zeros. A *googolplex* is is ten raised to the power of a\ngoogol, i.e., $10^{(10^{100})}$.\n\nThis is already a huge number. For instance, it is more than the number\nof atoms in the known universe. A googoplex is even larger. In fact,\nsince a googolplex has a googol number of zeros in its decimal\nrepresentation, a googoplex has more digits than there are atoms in our\nuniverse. Thus, even if all matter in the universe were at disposal, it\nwould not be possible to write down the decimal representatio[n]{} of a\ngoogolplex [@wikigoogol].\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n1.  A googol is approximately the factorial of $70$. The only prime\n    factors in a googol and a googolplex are $2$ and $5$ [@wikigoogol].\n\n2.  Using Stirling\u2019s formula we can approximate the factorial of a\n    googol to obtain $$10^{100}! \\approx 10^{9.95\\, \\cdot 10^{101}}.$$\n\n3.  A googoplex plus one is not a prime. One factor is\n    316912650057057350374175801344000001 [@mrob].\n\n### History and etymology {#history-and-etymology .unnumbered}\n\nThe googol was created by the American mathematician Edward Kasner\n(1878-1955) [@wikikasner] in [@kasner] to illustrate the difference\nbetween an unimaginably large number and infinity. The name \u2019googol\u2019 was\nsupposedly coined by Kasner\u2019s nine-year-old nephew Milton Sirotta in\n1938 when asked to give a name for a huge number. The name googol was\nperhaps influenced by the comic strip character Barney Google\n[@wikigoogol; @harper]. The name of the search engine google was\ninspired by the number googol [@google].\n\n[9]{} Wikipedia\u2019s .
