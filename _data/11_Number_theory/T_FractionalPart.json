  "definition": "The *fractional part* of a nonnegative real number is the part of the\nnumber that appears after the decimal . For example, the fractional part\nof $\\frac{7}{3}$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTo be more precise, for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x \\ge 0$, the\nfractional part of $x$, denoted as $\\{x\\}$, is given by $\\{x\\}=x-[x]$,\nwhere $[x]$ denotes the integer part of $x$.\n\nThe name \u201cfractional part\u201d is somewhat of a misnomer: To the novice, the\nname may seem to imply that the result must be a fraction (and therefore\nrational), which is not the case. For example, $\\{\\pi\\}=\\pi-3$, which is\nnot rational.",
