  "statement": "There are only a finite number of reduced primitive positive integral\nbinary quadratic forms of a given negative $\\Delta$. Given $\\Delta$,\ncall this number $h_{\\Delta}$, the *form of $\\Delta$*.\n\nThus, for example, since there is only one reduced form of discriminant\n$-163$, we have that $h_{-163}=1$.\n\nIt turns out that the set of reduced forms of a given negative\ndiscriminant can be turned into an abelian group, called the **,\n$\\mathcal{C}_{\\Delta}$, by defining a \u201cmultiplication\u201d on forms that is\nbased on generalizations of identities such as\n$$(2x^2+2xy+3y^2)(2z^2+2zw+3w^2)=(2xz+xw+yz+3yw)^2+5(xw+yz)^2$$ where\nall of these forms have discriminant $-20$.\n\nNow, given an algebraic extension $K$ of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, ideal classes\nof ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ also form an abelian group, called the ** of $K$,\n$\\mathcal{C}_K$. The order of $\\mathcal{C}_K$ is called the *class\nnumber* of $K$ and is denoted $h_K$. See the ideal class entry for more\ndetail.\n\nFor an algebraic extension $K/{\\mathbb{Q}}$, one also defines the of the\nextension, $d_K$. For quadratic extensions $K={\\mathbb{Q}}[\\sqrt{n}]$,\nwhere $n$ is assumed squarefree, the discriminant can be explicitly\ncomputed to be $$d_K=\\begin{cases} 4n& \\text{if }n\\equiv 2,3\\pmod 4\\\\\nn& \\text{if }n\\equiv 1\\pmod 4\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nFor imaginary quadratic extensions, the form class group and the class\ngroup turn out to be the same!\n\n\\[thm:one\\]Let $K={\\mathbb{Q}}(\\sqrt{n}), n<0$ squarefree, be a\nquadratic extension. Then $\\mathcal{C}_K$, the class group of $K$, is\nisomorphic to the group of reduced forms of discriminant $d_K$,\n$\\mathcal{C}_{d_K}$.\n\nOne can in fact exhibit an explicit correspondence\n$\\mathcal{C}_{d_K}\\to \\mathcal{C}_K$:\n$$ax^2+bxy+cy^2\\mapsto(a,\\frac{b+\\sqrt{d_K}}{2})$$ Note in particular\nthat the simplest, or principal, form of discriminant $d_K$\n($x^2-d_Ky^2$ or $x^2+xy+\\frac{1-d_K}{4}y^2$) maps to the ideal\n$(1)={\\mathcal{O}}_K$; these forms are the identities in\n$\\mathcal{C}_{d_K}$. Showing that the map is 1-1 and onto is not\ndifficult; showing that it is a group isomorphism is more difficult but\nnevertheless essentially amounts to a computation.\n\nThis theorem allows us to simply compute at least the size of the class\ngroup for quadratic extensions $K$ by computing the number of reduced\nforms of discriminant $d_K$. For example, suppose\n$K={\\mathbb{Q}}(\\sqrt{-23})$. Since $-23\\equiv 1\\pod 4$,\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K={\\mathbb{Z}}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}]$ and $d_K=-23$.\n\nWhat are the forms of discriminant $-23$?\n$\\lvert b\\rvert\\leq a\\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{23}{3}}<\\sqrt{8}<3$, and $b$ is\nodd, so $b=\\pm 1$. $4ac-b^2=23$, so $ac=6$. We thus get three reduced\nforms:\n\n  ------------ --\n   $(1,1,6)$   \n   $(2,1,3)$   \n   $(2,-1,3)$  \n  ------------ --\n\nNote that $(1,-1,6)$ is not reduced, since $b<0$ but $\\lvert b\\rvert=a$.\n\nSo we know that the order of the class group $\\mathcal{C}_K$ is $3$, so\n$\\mathcal{C}_K\\cong {\\mathbb{Z}}/3{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nWe can use the explicit correspondence above to find representatives of\nthe three elements of the class group using the map from forms to\nideals. $$\\begin{aligned}\n(1,1,6)&\\rightarrow \\left(1,\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right)=(1)\\\\\n(2,1,3)&\\rightarrow \\left(2,\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right)\\\\\n(2,-1,3)&\\rightarrow \\left(2,\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-23}}{2}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn fact, a more general form of Theorem \\[thm:one\\] is true. If $K$ is\nan algebraic number field, $A\\subset {\\mathcal{O}}_K$, then $A$ is not a\nDedekind domain unless $A={\\mathcal{O}}_K$. But even in this case, if\none considers only those ideals that are invertible in $A$, one can\ndefine a group structure in a similar way; this is once again called the\nclass group of $A$. In the case that $K$ is a quadratic extension, these\nsubrings of ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ are called *orders* of $K$.\n\nIt is the case that each discriminant\n$\\Delta<0, \\Delta\\equiv 0,1\\pmod 4$ corresponds to a unique order in a\nquadratic extension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$. Specifically,\n\nLet $\\Delta<0, \\Delta\\equiv 0,1\\pmod 4$. Write $\\Delta=m^2\\Delta'$ where\n$\\Delta'$ is squarefree. Let $K={\\mathbb{Q}}(\\sqrt{\\Delta'})$. Then\n$${\\mathcal{O}}_{\\Delta}=\\begin{cases}{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left[\\frac{m}{2}\\sqrt{\\Delta'}\\right], \\Delta'\\equiv 2,3\\pmod 4\\\\\n{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left[m\\frac{1+\\sqrt{\\Delta'}}{2}\\right], \\Delta'\\equiv 1\\pmod 4\n\\end{cases}$$ is a subring of ${\\mathcal{O}}_K$, and\n$\\mathcal{C}_{\\Delta}\\cong \\mathcal{C}_{{\\mathcal{O}}_{\\Delta}}$. (Note\nthat if $\\Delta'\\equiv 2,3\\pmod 4$, then $m$ must be even. For\notherwise, $m^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$ and thus $\\Delta\\equiv 2,3\\pmod 4$,\nwhich is impossible. Thus $m/2$ is an integer in this case)\n\nThis reduces to the first theorem in the event that $\\Delta=d_K$.\n\nThus there is a $1-1$ correspondence between discriminants $\\Delta<0$\nand orders of quadratic fields; in particular, the ring of algebraic\nintegers of any quadratic field corresponds to the forms of discriminant\nequal to the discriminant of the field.",
