  "definition": "A rational number $d$ is called a *decimal fraction* if $10^kd$ is an\ninteger for some non-negative integer $k$. For example, any integer, as\nwell as rationals such as\n$$0.23123,\\qquad \\frac{3}{4},\\qquad \\frac{236}{125}$$ are all decimal\nfractions. Rational numbers such as\n$$\\frac{1}{3},\\qquad -\\frac{227}{12}, \\qquad 2.\\overline{312}$$ are not.\n\nThere are two other ways of characterizing a decimal fraction: for a\nrational number $d$,\n\n1.  $d$ is as in the above definition;\n\n2.  $d$ can be written as a fraction $\\displaystyle{\\frac{p}{q}}$, where\n    $p$ and $q$ are integers, and $q=2^m5^n$ for some non-negative\n    integers $m$ and $n$;\n\n3.  $d$ has a terminating decimal expansion, meaning that it has a\n    decimal representation $$a.d_1d_2\\cdots d_n000\\cdots$$ where $a$ is\n    a nonnegative integer and $d_i$ is any one of the digits\n    $0,\\ldots,9$.\n\nA decimal fraction is sometimes called a *decimal number*, although a\ndecimal number in the most general sense may have non-terminating\ndecimal expansions.\n\n**Remarks**. Let $D\\subset \\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of all decimal\nfractions.\n\n-   If $a,b \\in D$, then $a\\cdot b$ and $a+b\\in D$ as well. Also,\n    $-a \\in D$ whenever $a\\in D$. In other words, $D$ is a subring of\n    $\\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, as an abelian group, $D$ is $2$-divisible\n    and $5$-divisible. However, unlike $\\mathbb{Q}$, $D$ is not .\n\n-   As inherited from $\\mathbb{Q}$, $D$ has a total order structure. It\n    is easy to see that $D$ is : for any $a,b\\in D$ with $a< b$, there\n    is $c\\in D$ such that $a<c<b$. Simply take\n    $c=\\displaystyle{\\frac{a+b}{2}}$.\n\n-   From a topological point of view, $D$, as a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$,\n    is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$. This is essentially the fact that every\n    real number has a decimal expansion, so that every real number can\n    be \u201capproximated\u201d by a decimal fraction to any degree of accuracy.\n\n-   We can associate each decimal fraction $d$ with the least\n    non-negative integer $k(d)$ such that $10^{k(d)}d$ is an integer.\n    This integer is uniquely determined by $d$. In fact, $k(d)$ is the\n    last decimal place where its corresponding digit is non-zero in its\n    decimal representation. For example, $k(1.41243)=5$ and $k(7/25)=2$.\n    It is not hard to see that if we write\n    $d=\\displaystyle{\\frac{p}{2^m5^n}}$, where $p$ and $2^m5^n$ are\n    coprime, then $k(d)=\\max(m,n)$.\n\n-   For each non-negative integer $i$, let $D(i)$ be the set of all\n    $d\\in D$ such that $k(d)=i$. Then $D$ can be partitioned into sets\n    $$D=D(0)\\cup D(1) \\cup \\cdots \\cup D(n) \\cup \\cdots.$$ Note that\n    $D(0)=\\mathbb{Z}$. Another basic property is that if $a\\in D(i)$ and\n    $b\\in D(j)$ with $i<j$, then $a+b\\in D(j)$.",
