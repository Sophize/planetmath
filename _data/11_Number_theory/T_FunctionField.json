  "definition": "Let $F$ be a field.\n\nThe rational function field over $F$ in one variable ($x$), denoted by\n$F(x)$, is the field of all rational functions $p(x)/q(x)$ with\npolynomials $p,q\\in F[x]$ and $q(x)$ not identically zero.\n\nA function field (in one variable) over $F$ is a field $K$, containing\n$F$ and at least one element $x$, transcendental over $F$, such that\n$K/F(x)$ is a algebraic extension.\n\nLet $\\overline{F}$ be a fixed algebraic closure of $F$.\n\nLet $K$ be a function field over $F$ and let $L$ be a finite extension\nof $K$. The extension $L/K$ of function fields is said to be geometric\nif $L\\cap \\overline{F}=F$.\n\nThe extension ${\\mathbb{Q}}(\\sqrt{x})/{\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is geometric, but\n${\\mathbb{Q}}(\\sqrt{2})(x)/{\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$ is not geometric.\n\nLet $K$ be a function field over an algebraically closed field $F$.\nThere exists a nonsingular projective curve $C_K$ such that the function\nfield of $C_K$ is isomorphic to $K$.\n\nLet $K$ be a function field over a field $F$. Let $K'=K\\overline{F}$\nwhich is a function field over $\\overline{F}$, a fixed algebraic closure\nof $F$, and let $C_{K'}$ be the curve given by the previous theorem. The\ngenus of $K$ is, by definition, the genus of $C_{K'}$.\n\nLet $K$ be a function field over a field $F$. A prime in $K$ is by\ndefinition a discrete valuation ring $R$ with maximal $P$ such that\n$F\\subset R$ and the quotient field of $R$ is equal to $K$. The prime is\nusually denoted $P$ after the maximal ideal of $R$. The degree of $P$,\ndenoted by $\\deg P$, is defined to be the dimension of $R/P$ over $F$.\n\nLet $K=F(x)$ be the rational function field over $F$ and let\n$\\mathcal{O}=F[x]$. The prime ideals of $\\mathcal{O}$ are generated by\nmonic irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$. Let $P=(f(x))$ be such a prime.\nThen $R_P=\\mathcal{O}_P$, the localization of $\\mathcal{O}$ at the prime\n$P$ is a discrete valuation ring with $F\\subset \\mathcal{O}_P$ and the\nquotient field of $R_P$ is $K$. Thus $R_P=\\mathcal{O}_P$ is a prime of\n$K$.\n\nOne can define an \u2018extra\u2019 prime in the following way. Let\n$R_\\infty=\\mathcal{O}_\\infty=F[\\frac{1}{x}]$ and let\n$P_\\infty=(\\frac{1}{x})$ be the prime ideal of $R_\\infty$ generated by\n$\\frac{1}{x}$. The localization ring $(R_\\infty)_{P_\\infty}$ is a prime\nof $K$, called the prime at infinity.\n\n[00]{} R. Hartshorne, [*Algebraic Geometry*]{}, Springer-Verlag, New\nYork. M.
