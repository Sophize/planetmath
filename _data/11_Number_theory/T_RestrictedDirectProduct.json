  "definition": "Let $\\{G_v\\}_{v \\in V}$ be a collection of locally compact topological\ngroups. For all but finitely many $v \\in V$, let $H_v \\subset G_v$ be a\ncompact open subgroup of $G_v$. The [*restricted direct product*]{} of\nthe collection $\\{G_v\\}$ with respect to the collection $\\{H_v\\}$ is the\nsubgroup\n$$G := \\left\\{ \\left. (g_v)_{v \\in V} \\in \\prod_{v \\in V} G_v\\ \\right| \\ g_v \\in H_v \\text{  for all but finitely many $v \\in V$} \\right\\}$$\nof the direct product $\\prod_{v \\in V} G_v$.\n\nWe define a topology on $G$ as follows. For every finite subset\n$S \\subset V$ that contains all the elements $v$ for which $H_v$ is\nundefined, form the topological group\n$$G_S := \\prod_{v \\in S} G_v \\times \\prod_{v \\notin S} H_v$$ consisting\nof the direct product of the $G_v$\u2019s, for $v \\in S$, and the $H_v$\u2019s,\nfor $v \\notin S$. The topological group $G_S$ is a subset of $G$ for\neach such $S$, and we take for a topology on $G$ the weakest topology\nsuch that the $G_S$ are open subsets of $G$, with the subspace topology\non each $G_S$ equal to the topology that $G_S$ already has in its own\nright.",
