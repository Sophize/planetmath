  "definition": "An integer of the form $${{(n^2 + n)(n + 2)} \\over 6},$$ where $n$ is a\nnonnegative integer. Sometimes referred to as $T_n$, [*tetrahedral\nnumbers*]{} are listed in A000292 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS. $2|T_n$ except when\n$n \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$.\n\nWith $t_n$ the $n$th triangular number, the $n$th tetrahedral number can\nbe calculated with this formula: $$T_n = \\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i.$$ Another\nway to calculate tetrahedral numbers is with the binomial coefficient\n$$T_n={n+2\\choose3}.$$ This means that tetrahedral numbers can be looked\nup in Pascal\u2019s triangle.\n\nTetrahedral numbers have practical applications in sphere packing.",
