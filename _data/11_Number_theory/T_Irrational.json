  "definition": "An *irrational number* is a real number which cannot be represented as a\nratio of two integers. That is, if $x$ is irrational, then\n\n$$x \\ne \\frac{a}{b}$$\n\nwith $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $b \\ne 0$.\n\n### Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n\n1.  $\\sqrt[p]{2}$ is irrational for $p=2,3,\\ldots$,\n\n2.  $\\pi, e$, and $\\sqrt[p]{2}$ for $p=2,3,\\ldots$, are irrational,\n\n3.  It is not known whether Euler\u2019s constant is rational or irrational.\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n1.  If $a$ is a real number and $a^n$ is irrational for some\n    $n=2,3,\\ldots$, then $a$ is irrational ().\n\n2.  The sum, difference, product, and quotient (when defined) of two\n    numbers, one rational and another irrational, is irrational. ().",
