  "definition": "Linear recurrences can be used to obtain rational approximations for\nreal algebraic numbers. Suppose that $\\rho$ is the root of a polynomial\n$p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n c_k x^k$ with rational coefficients $c_k$ and\nfurther assume that the roots of $p$ are distinct and that all the other\nroots of $p$ are strictly smaller in absolute value than $\\rho$.\n\nConsider the recursion $$\\sum_{k=0}^n c_k a_{m+k} = 0.$$ As discussed in\nthe parent entry, the solution of this recurrence is\n$$a_m = \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k r_k^m,$$ where $r_1, \\ldots, r_n$ are the roots\nof $p$ \u2014 let us agree that $r_1 = \\rho$ \u2014 and the $b_k$\u2019s are determined\nby the initial conditions of the recurrence. If $b_1 \\neq 0$, we have\n$${a_{m+1} \\over a_m} = \n {b_1 \\rho^{m+1} + \\sum_{k=2}^n b_k r_k^{m+1} \\over \n  b_1 \\rho^m + \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k r_k^m} =\n \\rho {1 + \\sum_{k=2}^n \\left( {b_k \\over b_1} \\right) \n                  \\left( {r_k \\over \\rho} \\right)^{m+1} \\over \n       1 + \\sum_{k=2}^n \\left( {b_k \\over b_1} \\right) \n                        \\left( {r_k \\over \\rho} \\right)^m}.$$ Because\n$|\\frac{r_k}{\\rho}| < 1$ when $k > 1$, we have $\\lim_{m \\to \\infty}\n(r_k / \\rho)^m = 0$, and hence\n$$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} {a_{m+1} \\over a_m} = \\rho.$$\n\nTo illustrate this method, we will compute the square root of two. Now,\nwe cannot use the equation $x^2 - 2 = 0$ because it has two roots,\n$+\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$, which are equal in absolute value. So what\nwe shall do instead is to use the equation $(x - 1)^2 = 2$, or\n$x^2 - 2 x\n- 3 = 0$, whose roots are $1 - \\sqrt{2}$ and $1 + \\sqrt{2}$. Since\n$|1 + \\sqrt{2}| > |1 - \\sqrt{2}|$, we can use our method to approximate\nthe larger of these roots, namely $1 + \\sqrt{2}$; to approximate\n$\\sqrt{2}$, we subtract $1$ from our answer. The recursion we should use\nis $$a_{m+2} - 2 a_{m+1} - a_m = 0$$ or, moving terms around,\n$$a_{m+2} = 2 a_{m+1} + a_m.$$ If we choose\n$b_1 = - b_2 = 1/(2 \\sqrt{2})$, then we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n a_0 &= b_1 \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\right )^0 +\n       b_2 \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\right )^0 = b_1 + b_2 = 0 \\\\\n a_1 &= b_1 \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\right )^1 +\n        b_2 \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\right )^1 =\n        b_1 + b_2 + (b_1 - b_2) \\sqrt{2} = 1.\\end{aligned}$$ Starting\nwith these values, we obtain the following sequence: $$\\begin{aligned}\n a_0 &= 0 \\\\\n a_1 &= 1 \\\\\n a_2 &= 2 \\\\\n a_3 &= 5 \\\\\n a_4 &= 12 \\\\\n a_5 &= 29 \\\\\n a_6 &= 70 \\\\\n a_7 &= 169 \\\\\n a_8 &= 408 \\\\\n a_9 &= 985 \\\\\n a_{10} &= 2738 \\\\\n a_{11} &= 5741 \\\\\n a_{12} &= 13860\\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, as our approximations to\n$\\sqrt{2}$, we have\n$$1, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{7}{5}, \\frac{17}{12}, \\frac{41}{29}, \n \\frac{99}{70}, \\frac{239}{169}, \\frac{577}{408},\n \\frac{1753}{985}, \\frac{3003}{2738}, \\frac{8119}{5741}.$$\n\nBy making suitable transformations, one can compute all the roots of a\npolynomial using this technique. A way to do this is to start with a\nrational number $h$ which is closer to the desired root than to the\nother roots, then make a change of variable $x = 1 / (y + h)$.\n\nAs an example, we shall examine the roots of $x^3 + 9 x + 1$.\nApproximating the polynomial by leaving off the constant term, we guess\nthat the roots are close to $0$, $+3i$, and $-3i$. Since the two complex\nroots are conjugates, it suffices to find one of them.\n\nTo look for the root near $0$, we make the change of variable $x = \n1 / y$ to obtain $y^3 + 9 y^2 + 1 = 0$, which gives the recursion\n$a_{k+3} + 9 a_{k+2} + a_k = 0$. Picking some initial values, this\nrecursion gives us the sequence\n$$0, 0, 1, -9, 81, -738, 6723, -61236, 557766, -5090401, \\ldots,$$\nwhence we obtain the approximations\n$$-\\frac{1}{9}, -\\frac{1}{9}, -\\frac{81}{738}, -\\frac{738}{6723},\n-\\frac{6723}{61236}, -\\frac{61236}{557766}, \n-\\frac{557766}{5090401}, \\ldots.$$\n\nTo look for the root near $3i$, we make the change of variable\n$x = 1 / (y + 3 i)$ to obtain $y^3 + (9 + 9 i) y^2 + (-27 + 54 i) y\n+ 82 - 27 i = 0$, which gives the recursion\n$$a_{k+3} + (9 + 9 i) a_{k+2} + (-27 + 54 i) a_{k+1} + \n           (82 - 27 i) a_k = 0.$$ Picking some initial values, this\nrecursion gives us the sequence\n$$0,\\, 0,\\, 1,\\, - 9 - 9 i,\\, 27 + 108 i,\\, -82 - 945 i,\\, \n - 225 + 11196 i,\\, 44415 - 127953 i, \\ldots,$$",
