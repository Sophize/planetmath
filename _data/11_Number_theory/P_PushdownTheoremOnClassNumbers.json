  "statement": "As in the entry, given a number field $K$, the class number of $K$ is\ndenoted by $h_K$.\n\nLet $E/F$ be a $p$-extension of number fields and suppose that only one\nprime ideal of $F$ is ramified in $E$ and that this prime is totally\nramified. Then $p|h_E$ implies $p|h_F$.\n\n[HGM02]{} A. Fr\u00f6hlich, *On a method for the determination of class\nnumber factors in number fields*, Mathematika, 4 (1957), 113-121.\n\nK.
