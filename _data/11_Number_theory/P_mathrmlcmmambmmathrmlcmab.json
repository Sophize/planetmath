We\nconclude that $mu$ is *not* a common multiple of $ma$ and $mb$ when\n$u<t$.\n\nSo far, we proved that $mt = m{\\,\\mathrm{lcm}}(a,b)$ is a common\nmultiple of $ma$ and $mb$, and previous paragraph shows that there is no\nsmaller common multiple, therefore $m{\\,\\mathrm{lcm}}(a,b)$ is the\n*least* common multiple of $ma$ and $mb$, in other words:\n$${\\,\\mathrm{lcm}}(ma,mb) = m{\\,\\mathrm{lcm}}(a,b).$$",
