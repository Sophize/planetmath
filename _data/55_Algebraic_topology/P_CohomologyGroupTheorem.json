Let us also consider the set of\nnon-basepointed homotopy classes $[X, K(\\pi,n)]$ of non-basepointed maps\n$\\eta :X \\to K(\\pi,n)$ and the $\\overline{H}^n(X;\\pi)$. Then, there\nexist the following *natural isomorphisms*:\n\n$$[X, K(\\pi,n)]  \\cong \\overline{H}^n(X;\\pi),$$\n\nRelated remarks:\n----------------\n\n1.  In order to determine all cohomology operations one needs only to\n    compute the cohomology of all Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $K(\\pi,n)$;\n    (source: ref [@MJP1999]);\n\n2.  When $n = 1$, and $\\pi$ is *non-Abelian*, one still has that\n    $[X,K(\\pi ,1)] \\cong Hom(\\pi_1(X),\\pi)/\\pi$, that is, the conjugacy\n    class or representation of $\\pi_1$ into $\\pi$;\n\n3.  A derivation of this result based on the fundamental cohomology\n    theorem is also attached.\n\n[9]{}\n\nMay, J.P. 1999. *A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology*, The University\nof Chicago Press: Chicago.,p.173.",
