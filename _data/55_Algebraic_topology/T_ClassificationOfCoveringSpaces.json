  "definition": "Let $X$ be a connected, locally path connected and semilocally simply\nconnected space. Assume furthermore that $X$ has a basepoint $*$.\n\nA covering $p\\co E\\to X$ is called *based* if $E$ is endowed with a\nbasepoint $e$ and $p(e)=*$. Two based coverings $p_i\\co E_i\\to X$,\n$i=1,2$ are called equivalent if there is a basepoint preserving\nequivalence $T\\co E_1\\to E_2$ that covers the identity, i.e. $T$ is a\nhomeomorphism and the following diagram commutes\n$$\\xymatrix{  {(E_1,e_1)}\\ar[dr]_{p}\\ar[rr]^{T}&&{(E_2,e_2)}\\ar[dl]^{p}\\\\ \n &{(X,*)}.&  }$$\n\n$ $\n\n-   Equivalence classes of based coverings $p\\co (E,e)\\to (X,*)$ with\n    connected total space $E$ are in bijective correspondence with\n    subgroups of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,*)$. The bijection\n    assigns to the based covering $p$ the subgroup\n    $p_*\\left(\\pi_1(E,e)\\right)$.\n\n-   Equivalence classes of coverings (not based) are in bijective\n    correspondence with conjugacy class of subgroups of $\\pi_1(X,*)$.\n\nUnder the bijection of the above theorem normal coverings correspond to\nnormal subgroups of $\\pi_1(X,e)$, and in particular the universal\ncovering $\\tilde \\pi\\co \\tilde X\\to X$ corresponds to the trivial\nsubgroup while the trivial covering ${ \\operatorname{id}}\\co X\\to X$\ncorresponds to the whole group.\n\nNormal coverings are sometimes called Galois coverings, and the group of\ndeck transformations is someitmes called the Galois group of the\ncovering space. The reason for this is that this theorem provides a\ndirect analogy for the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. This\ntheorem provides a correspondence between subgroups of the Galois group\nof a cover and covers that are its quotients, just as the fundamental\ntheorem of Galois theory provides a correspondence between subextensions\nof a field extension and subgroups of its Galois group. Both fundamental\ntheorems can be viewed as special cases of a more general theorem in the\ncategory of schemes; the correct tool is the study of \u00e9tale morphisms\nand the \u00e9tale fundamental group.\n\nWe describe the based version. Clearly the set of equivalences of two\nbased coverings form a torsor of the group of deck transformations\n${ \\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$. From our discussion of that group it follows\nthen that equivalent (based) coverings give the same subgroup. Thus the\nmap is well defined. To see that it is a bijection construct its inverse\nas follows: There is a universal covering $\\tilde \\pi\\co \\tilde X\\to X$\nand a subgroup $\\pi$ of $\\pi_1(X,*)$ acts on $\\tilde X$ by the\nrestriction of the monodromy action. The covering which corresponds to\n$\\pi$ is then $\\tilde X/\\pi$.",
