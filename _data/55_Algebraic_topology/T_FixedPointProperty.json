  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space. If every continuous function\n$f\\colon X\\to X$ has a , then $X$ is said to have the *fixed point\nproperty*.\n\nThe fixed point property is obviously preserved under homeomorphisms. If\n$h\\colon X\\to Y$ is a homeomorphism between topological spaces $X$ and\n$Y$, and $X$ has the fixed point property, and $f\\colon Y\\to Y$ is\ncontinuous, then $h^{-1}\\circ f\\circ h$ has a fixed point $x\\in X$, and\n$h(x)$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n========\n\n1.  A space with only one point has the fixed point property.\n\n2.  A closed interval $[a,b]$ of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ has the fixed point\n    property.\n\n3.  The extended real numbers have the fixed point property, as they are\n    homeomorphic to $[0,1]$.\n\n4.  The topologist\u2019s sine curve has the fixed point property.\n\n5.  The real numbers ${\\mathbb{R}}$ do not have the fixed point\n    property. For example, the map $x\\mapsto x+1$ on ${\\mathbb{R}}$ has\n    no fixed point.\n\n6.  An open interval $(a,b)$ of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ does not have the fixed\n    point property. This follows since any such interval is homeomorphic\n    to ${\\mathbb{R}}$. Similarly, an open ball in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ does\n    not have the fixed point property.\n\n7.  Brouwer\u2019s Fixed Point Theorem states that in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, the\n    closed unit ball with the subspace topology has the fixed point\n    property. (Equivalently, $[0,1]^n$ has the fixed point property.)\n    The Schauder Fixed Point Theorem generalizes this result further.\n\n8.  For each $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$, the real projective space\n    ${\\mathbb{RP}}^{2n}$ has the fixed point property.\n\n9.  Every simply-connected plane continuum has the fixed-point property.\n\n10. The Alexandroff\u2013Urysohn square (also known as the Alexandroff\n    square) has the fixed point property.\n\nProperties {#properties .unnumbered}\n==========\n\n1.  and .\n\n2.  Suppose $X$ is a topological space with the fixed point property,\n    and $Y$ is a retract of $X$. Then $Y$ has the fixed point property.\n\n3.  Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, and $X\\times Y$ has the\n    fixed point property. Then $X$ and $Y$ have the fixed point\n    property. (Proof: If $f\\colon X\\to X$ is continuous, then\n    $(x,y)\\mapsto (f(x),y)$ is continuous, so $f$ has a fixed point.)\n\n[9]{} G.\u00a0L.\u00a0Naber, *Topological methods in Euclidean spaces*, Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1980.
