  "definition": "Given a fiber bundle ${p:{E\\rightarrow B}}$ with typical fiber $F$ and\nstructure group $G$ (henceforth called an $(F,G)$-bundle over $B$), we\nsay that the bundle admits a [*reduction of its structure group to\n$H$,*]{} where $H<G$ is a subgroup, if it is isomorphic to an\n$(F,H)$-bundle over $B.$\n\nEquivalently, $E$ admits a reduction of structure group to $H$ if there\nis a choice of local trivializations covering $E$ such that the\ntransition functions all belong to $H.$\n\nHere, the action of $H$ on $F$ is the restriction of the $G$-action; in\nparticular, this means that an $(F,H)$-bundle is automatically an\n$(F,G)$-bundle. The bundle isomorphism in the definition then becomes\nmeaningful in the category of $(F,G)$-bundles over $B$.\n\nLet $H$ be the trivial subgroup. Then, the existence of a reduction of\nstructure group to $H$ is equivalent to the bundle being trivial.\n\nFor the following examples, let $E$ be an $n$-dimensional vector bundle,\nso that $F{\\cong}{{\\mathbb R}}^n$ with $G=GL(n,{{\\mathbb R}}),$ the\ngeneral linear group acting as usual.\n\nSet $H=GL^+(n,{{\\mathbb R}}),$ the subgroup of $GL(n,{{\\mathbb R}})$\nconsisting of matrices with positive determinant. A reduction to $H$ is\nequivalent to an orientation of the vector bundle. In the case where $B$\nis a smooth manifold and $E=TB$ is its tangent bundle, this coincides\nwith other definitions of an orientation of $B$.\n\nSet $H=O(n)$, the orthogonal group. A reduction to $H$ is called a\n[*Riemannian*]{} or [*Euclidean structure*]{} on the vector bundle. It\ncoincides with a continuous fiberwise choice of a positive definite\ninner product, and for the case of the tangent bundle, with the usual\nnotion of a Riemannian metric on a manifold.\n\nWhen $B$ is paracompact, an argument with partitions of unity shows that\na Riemannian structure always exists on any given vector bundle. For\nthis reason, it is often convenient to start out assuming the structure\ngroup to be $O(n).$\n\nLet $n=2m$ be even, and let $H=GL(m,{{\\mathbb C}}),$ the group of\ninvertible complex matrices, embedded in $GL(n,{{\\mathbb R}})$ by means\nof the usual identification of ${{\\mathbb C}}$ with ${{\\mathbb R}}^2.$ A\nreduction to $H$ is called a [*complex structure*]{} on the vector\nbundle, and it is equivalent to a continuous fiberwise choice of an\nendomorphism $J$ satisfying $J^2=-I.$\n\nA complex structure on a tangent bundle is called an [*almost-complex\nstructure*]{} on the manifold. This is to distinguish it from the more\nrestrictive notion of a complex structure on a manifold, which requires\nthe existence of an atlas with charts in ${{\\mathbb C}}^m$ such that the\ntransition functions are holomorphic.\n\nLet $H=GL(1,{{\\mathbb R}}){\\times}GL(n-1,{{\\mathbb R}}),$ embedded in\n$GL(n,{{\\mathbb R}})$ by ${\\left(A,B\\right)}\\mapsto A\\oplus B.$ A\nreduction to $H$ is equivalent to the existence of a splitting\n$E{\\cong}E_1\\oplus E_2,$ where $E_1$ is a line bundle. More generally, a\nreduction to $GL(k,{{\\mathbb R}}){\\times}GL(n-k,{{\\mathbb R}})$ is\nequivalent to a splitting $E{\\cong}E_1\\oplus E_2,$ where $E_1$ is a\n$k$-plane bundle.\n\nThese examples all have two features in common, namely:\n\n-   the subgroup $H$ can be interpreted as being precisely the subgroup\n    of $G$ which preserves a particular structure, and,\n\n-   a reduction to $H$ is equivalent to a continuous fiber-by-fiber\n    choice of a structure of the same kind.\n\nFor example, $O(n)$ is the subgroup of $GL(n,{{\\mathbb R}})$ which\npreserves the standard inner product of ${{\\mathbb R}}^n,$ and reduction\nof structure to $O(n)$ is equivalent to a fiberwise choice of inner\nproducts.\n\nThis is not a coincidence. The intuition behind this is as follows.\nThere is no obstacle to choosing a fiberwise inner product in a\nneighborhood of any given point $x\\in B$: we simply choose a\nneighborhood $U$ on which the bundle is trivial, and with respect to a\ntrivialization ${p^{-1}}(U){\\cong}{{\\mathbb R}}^n{\\times}U$, we can let\nthe inner product on each ${p^{-1}}(y)$ be the standard inner product.\nHowever, if we make these choices locally around every point in $B$,\nthere is no guarantee that they \u201cglue together\u201d properly to yield a\nglobal continuous choice, [*unless*]{} the transition functions preserve\nthe standard inner product. But this is precisely what reduction of\nstructure to $O(n)$ means.\n\nThe same explanation holds for subgroups preserving other kinds of\nstructure.",
