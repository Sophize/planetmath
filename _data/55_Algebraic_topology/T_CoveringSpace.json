  "definition": "Let $X$ and $E$ be topological spaces and suppose there is a surjective\ncontinuous map $p\\colon E \\rightarrow X$ which satisfies the following\ncondition: for each $x \\in X$, there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$\nsuch that\n\n-   $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets $E_{i} \\subset E$, and\n\n-   each $E_{i}$ is mapped homeomorphically onto $U$ via $p$.\n\nThen $E$ is called a *covering space*, $p$ is called a *covering map*,\nthe $E_{i}$\u2019s are *sheets* of the covering of $U$ and for each\n$x \\in X$, $p^{-1}(x)$ is the *fiber* of $p$ above $x$. The open set $U$\nis said to be *evenly covered*. If $E$ is simply connected, it is called\nthe *universal covering space*.\n\nFrom this we can derive that $p$ is a local homeomorphism, so that any\nlocal property $E$ has is inherited by $X$ (local connectedness, local\npath connectedness etc.). Covering spaces are foundational in the study\nof the fundamental group of a topological space; in particular, there is\na between connected coverings of $X$ and subgroups of the group of deck\ntransformations of its universal covering space which is exactly\nanalogous to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.\n\nCovering maps are especially important in the study of Riemann surfaces;\nin this context, one sometimes discusses a generalized notion of\ncovering map called a \u201cramified covering\u201d; this allows one to replace a\ndiscrete set of the local homeomorphisms by maps that locally look like\n$z\\mapsto z^n$ in the complex plane near zero. Covering maps are also\ngeneralized in algebraic geometry; there the corresponding notion is\nthat of \u00e9tale morphism.\n\nNote that this is a completely separate usage of the word \u201ccover\u201d than\nwe encounter in \u201copen cover\u201d; confusion usually does not arise.",
