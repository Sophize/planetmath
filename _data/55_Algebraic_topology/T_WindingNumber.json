  "definition": "Winding numbers are a basic notion in algebraic topology, and play an\nimportant role in connection with analytic functions of a complex\nvariable. Intuitively, given a closed curve $t\\mapsto S(t)$ in an\noriented Euclidean plane (such as the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$), and a\npoint $p$ not in the image of $S$, the winding number (or index) of $S$\nwith respect to $p$ is the net number of times $S$ surrounds $p$. It is\nnot altogether easy to make this notion rigorous.\n\nLet us take $\\mathbb{C}$ for the plane. We have a continuous mapping\n$S:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{C}$ where $a$ and $b$ are some reals with $a<b$ and\n$S(a)=S(b)$. Denote by $\\theta(t)$ the angle from the positive real axis\nto the ray from $z_0$ to $S(t)$. As $t$ moves from $a$ to $b$, we expect\n$\\theta$ to increase or decrease by a multiple of $2\\pi$, namely\n$2\\omega\\pi$ where $\\omega$ is the winding number. One therefore thinks\nof using integration. And indeed, in the theory of functions of a\ncomplex variable, it is proved that the value\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_S \\frac{dz}{z-z_0}$$ is an integer and has the\nexpected properties of a winding number around $z_0$. To define the\nwinding number in this way, we need to assume that the closed path $S$\nis rectifiable (so that the path integral is defined). An equivalent\ncondition is that the real and imaginary parts of the function $S$ are\nof bounded variation.\n\nBut if $S$ is any continuous mapping $[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{C}$ having\n$S(a)=S(b)$, the winding number is still definable, without any\nintegration. We can break up the domain of $S$ into a finite number of\nintervals such that the image of $S$, on any of those intervals, is\ncontained in a disc which does not contain $z_0$. Then $2\\omega\\pi$\nemerges as a finite sum: the sum of the angles subtended at $z_0$ by the\nsides of a polygon.\n\nLet $A$, $B$, and $C$ be any three distinct rays from $z_0$. The three\nsets $$S^{-1}(A)\\qquad S^{-1}(B)\\qquad S^{-1}(C)$$ are closed in\n$[a,b]$, and they *determine* the winding number of $S$ around $z_0$.\nThis result can provide an alternative definition of winding numbers in\n$\\mathbb{C}$, and a definition in some other spaces also, but the\ndetails are rather subtle.\n\nFor one more variation on the theme, let $S$ be any topological space\nhomeomorphic to a circle, and let $f:S\\to S$ be any continuous mapping.\nIntuitively we expect that if a point $x$ travels once around $S$, the\npoint $f(x)$ will travel around $S$ some integral number of times, say\n$n$ times. The notion can be made precise. Moreover, the number $n$ is\ndetermined by the three closed sets\n$$f^{-1}(a)\\qquad f^{-1}(b)\\qquad f^{-1}(c)$$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$\nare any three distinct points in $S$.",
