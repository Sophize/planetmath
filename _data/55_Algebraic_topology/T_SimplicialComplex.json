  "definition": "An abstract *simplicial complex* $K$ is a collection of nonempty finite\nsets with the property that for any element $\\sigma \\in K$, if\n$\\tau \\subset \\sigma$ is a nonempty subset, then $\\tau \\in K$. An\nelement of $K$ of cardinality $n+1$ is called an *$n$-simplex*. An\nelement of an element of $K$ is called a *vertex*. In what follows, we\nmay occasionally identify a vertex $v$ with its corresponding singleton\nset $\\{v\\} \\in K$; the reader will be alerted when this is the case.\n\nThe *standard $n$-complex*, denoted by $\\Delta_n$, is the simplicial\ncomplex consisting of all nonempty subsets of $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n\\}$.\n\nGeometry of a simplicial complex\n================================\n\nLet $K$ be a simplicial complex, and let $V$ be the set of vertices of\n$K$. Although there is an established notion of infinite simplicial\ncomplexes, the geometrical treatment of simplicial complexes is much\nsimpler in the finite case and so for now we will assume that $V$ is a\nfinite set of cardinality $k$.\n\nWe introduce the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^V$ of formal\n${\\mathbb{R}}$\u2013linear combinations of elements of $V$; i.e.,\n$${\\mathbb{R}}^V := \\{a_1 V_1 + a_2 V_2 + \\cdots + a_k V_k \\mid a_i \\in {\\mathbb{R}},\\ V_i \\in\nV\\},$$ and the vector space operations are defined by formal addition\nand scalar multiplication. Note that we may regard each vertex in $V$ as\na one-term formal sum, and thus as a point in ${\\mathbb{R}}^V$.\n\nThe *geometric realization* of $K$, denoted $|K|$, is the subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^V$ consisting of the union, over all $\\sigma \\in K$, of the\nconvex hull of $\\sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^V$. If we fix a bijection\n$\\phi\\colon V \\to \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, then the vector space\n$\\mathbb{R}^V$ is isomorphic to the Euclidean vector space\n$\\mathbb{R}^k$ via $\\phi$, and the set $|K|$ inherits a metric from\n$\\mathbb{R}^k$ making it into a metric space and topological space. The\nisometry class of $K$ is independent of the choice of the bijection\n$\\phi$.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1.  $\\Delta_2 = \\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\{0,2\\}, \\{1,2\\},\n    \\{0,1,2\\}\\}$ has $V = 3$, so its realization $|\\Delta_2|$ is a\n    subset of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, consisting of all points on the hyperplane\n    $x+y+z =\n    1$ that are inside or on the boundary of the first octant. These\n    points form a triangle in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with one face, three edges,\n    and three vertices (for example, the convex hull of $\\{0,1\\} \\in\n    \\Delta_2$ is the edge of this triangle that lies in the $xy$\u2013plane).\n\n2.  Similarly, the realization of the standard $n$\u2013simplex $\\Delta_n$ is\n    an $n$\u2013dimensional tetrahedron contained inside $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\n3.  A triangle without interior (a \u201cwire frame\u201d triangle) can be\n    geometrically realized by starting from the simplicial complex\n    $\\{\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\{0,2\\}, \\{1,2\\}\\}$.\n\nNotice that, under this procedure, an element of $K$ of cardinality 1 is\ngeometrically a vertex; an element of cardinality 2 is an edge;\ncardinality 3, a face; and, in general, an element of cardinality $n$ is\nrealized as an $n$-face inside ${\\mathbb{R}}^V$.\n\nIn general, a *triangulation* of a topological space $X$ is a simplicial\ncomplex $K$ together with a homeomorphism from $|K|$ to $X$.\n\nHomology of a simplicial complex\n================================\n\nIn this section we define the homology and cohomology groups associated\nto a simplicial complex $K$. We do so not because the homology of a\nsimplicial complex is so intrinsically interesting in and of itself, but\nbecause the resulting homology theory is identical to the singular\nhomology of the associated topological space $|K|$, and therefore\nprovides an accessible way to calculate the latter homology groups (and,\nby extension, the homology of any space $X$ admitting a triangulation by\n$K$).\n\nAs before, let $K$ be a simplicial complex, and let $V$ be the set of\nvertices in $K$. Let the chain group $C_n(K)$ be the subgroup of the\nexterior algebra $\\Lambda({\\mathbb{R}}^V)$ generated by all elements of\nthe form $V_0 \\wedge V_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge V_n$ such that $V_i \\in V$\nand $\\{V_0, V_1, \\ldots, V_n\\} \\in K$. Note that we are ignoring here\nthe ${\\mathbb{R}}$\u2013vector space structure of ${\\mathbb{R}}^V$; the group\n$C_n(K)$ under this definition is merely a free abelian group, generated\nby the alternating products of the above form and with the relations\nthat are implied by the properties of the wedge product.\n\nDefine the boundary map $\\partial_n: C_n(K) \\longrightarrow\nC_{n-1}(K)$ by the formula\n$$\\partial_n(V_0 \\wedge V_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge V_n) := \\sum_{j=0}^n\n(-1)^j (V_0 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\hat{V_j} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge V_n),$$\nwhere the hat notation means the term under the hat is left out of the\nproduct, and extending linearly to all of $C_n(K)$. Then one checks\neasily that $\\partial_{n-1} \\circ \\partial_n = 0$, so the collection of\nchain groups $C_n(K)$ and boundary maps $\\partial_n$ forms a chain\ncomplex $\\mathcal{C}(K)$. The simplicial homology and cohomology groups\nof $K$ are defined to be that of $\\mathcal{C}(K)$.\n\n**Theorem:** The simplicial homology and cohomology groups of $K$, as\ndefined above, are canonically isomorphic to the singular homology and\ncohomology groups of the geometric realization $|K|$ of $K$.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is considerably more difficult than what we\nhave done to this point, requiring the techniques of barycentric\nsubdivision and simplicial approximation, and we refer the interested\nreader to\u00a0[@munkres].\n\n[9]{}",
