  "definition": "Recall that an abstract $n$-simplex is an abstract simplicial complex\n$K$ such that $\\bigcup K\\in K$ and the cardinality of $\\bigcup K$ is\n$n+1$. It can be identified as the powerset (minus the empty set\nelement) of a set $V_K$ of elements $v_1,\\ldots, v_n$, called the\nvertices of $K$.\n\nThe *barycentric subdivision* of an abstract simplex $K$ is the\nconstruction of a certain abstract simplicial complex $K'$ from $K$.\n$K'$ itself is called the *barycentric subdivision* of $K$. Before\ngiving the general construction, let us describe some simple cases,\nspecifically, when $n=1,2,$ and $3$ and when $V_K$ is embedded in some\nambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^m$ where $m\\ge n$:\n\n-   When $n=1$, $V_K$ is just a one-point space. We define the\n    barycentric subdivision of $K$ to be $K$ itself: $K'=K$.\n\n-   When $n=2$, $V_K$ consists of two distinct points $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    Take the midpoint $w$ of $v_1$ and $v_2$. Then the barycentric\n    subdivision $K'$ is defined to be the union of powersets of\n    $\\lbrace v_1, w\\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace v_2, w\\rbrace$. Abstracting\n    this process, $K'$ can be thought of as the union of all the\n    $2$-simplices having $w$ as a vertex.\n\n    ![image](bary.eps)\n\n-   When $n=3$, $V_K$ consists of three distinct non-collinear points,\n    $v_1,v_2,v_3$. We may picture them as the vertices of a triangle.\n    From each of these vertices, draw a line connecting the vertex to\n    the midpoint of the opposite side. This construction creates six\n    smaller triangles, such that each pair either intersect at a common\n    vertex or a common side. The barycentric subdivision $K'$ is defined\n    as the union of each of these smaller triangles considered as a\n    simplex. In other words, $K'$ is the union of the powerset of the\n    three-point sets that correspond to these smaller triangles.\n\n    ![image](bary2.eps)\n\n    Abstracting this process, we may take $w$ as the barycenter of\n    $v_1,v_2,$ and $v_3$. Label $w=w(123)$, so\n    $$w(123)=\\frac{1}{3}(v_1+v_2+v_3).$$ Next, take $w(12),w(23),$ and\n    $w(13)$ as the midpoints of $(v_1,v_2)$, $(v_2,v_3)$ and\n    $(v_1,v_3)$. Finally, relabel $v_1,v_2,v_3$ as $w(1),w(2),w(3)$. We\n    form six three-point sets:\n    $$W(32):=\\lbrace w(123), w(12), w(1) \\rbrace,\\quad W(31):=\\lbrace w(123), w(12), w(2) \\rbrace,$$\n    $$W(23):=\\lbrace w(123), w(13), w(1) \\rbrace,\\quad W(21):=\\lbrace w(123), w(13), w(3) \\rbrace,$$\n    $$W(13):=\\lbrace w(123), w(23), w(2) \\rbrace,\\quad W(12):=\\lbrace w(123), w(23), w(3) \\rbrace.$$\n    The formation of any one of these sets goes as follows:\n\n    1.  it must contain the barycenter $w(123)$;\n\n    2.  from $w(123)$, pick one of the midpoints $w(12),w(23),w(13)$ to\n        be the next point in the set;\n\n    3.  once the midpoint is chosen, pick one of the initial vertices so\n        that the label occurs in the labeling of the midpoint. For\n        example, if $w(23)$ were picked, only one of vertices $w(2)$ or\n        $w(3)$ is allowed to be picked next.\n\n    The logic behind the labeling $ab$ of $W(ab)$ comes from the fact\n    that the labeling of the midpoint in $W(ab)$ does not contain $a$\n    and the labeling of the initial vertex in $W(ab)$ does not contain\n    $b$.\n\n    Finally, we form $K'$ as the union of the powersets of $W(ab)$\u2019s.\n\nIn the last example, one can abstract the construction one step further.\nSince each labelled point is the barycenter of at least one of the\ninitial vertices $v_i$, we can uniquely identify any non-empty subset\n$V$ of $V_K$ with the labelled point that is the barycenter of the\npoint(s) in $V$. Then each $W(ab)$ above can be identified as a maximal\nchain (ordered by inclusion) in $K$ with $\\varnothing$ deleted.\n\nThis suggests the general construction of the barycentric subdivision of\nan abstract $n$-simplex.\n\n**Definition**. Let $K$ be an abstract $n$-simplex. Order $K$ by\ninclusion $\\subseteq$. Let\n$$\\mathcal{C}_K:=\\big\\lbrace P(C) \\mid C\\mbox{ is a maximal chain in }K\\big\\rbrace.$$\nThe *barycentric subdivision* $K'$ of $K$ is:\n$$K'=\\bigcup \\mathcal{C}_K - \\lbrace \\varnothing\\rbrace.$$\n\nIt is easy to see that every maximal chain in $K$ is an $(n-1)$-simplex\nwhose powerset is an $n$-simplex (so isomorphic to $K$). In addition,\nthe barycentric subdivision $K'$ of $K$ is a simplicial complex with\n$n!$ maximal simplices, each of which is isomorphic to $K$.\n\n**Remark**. This definition can be generalized to include the\nbarycentric subdivision of an abstract simplicial complex. If $K$ is an\nabstract simplicial complex, then the *barycentric subdivision* $K'$ of\n$K$ is the union of the barycentric subdivisions of the individual\nmaximal simplicies in $K$. Below are two examples:\n\n-   In this example (pictured above), the maximal simplices of $K$\n    consist of a triangle, and two line segments.\n\n    (0,-1)(8,3) (0,0)(0,3)(3,0) (0,3)(3,0) (3,0)(3,3) (0,3)(3,3) (0,0)\n    (0,3) (3,0) (3,3) (1.5,-1)[$K$]{} (5,0)(5,3)(8,0) (5,3)(8,0)\n    (5,0)(6.5,1.5) (5,3)(6.5,0) (8,0)(5,1.5) (5,3)(8,3) (8,0)(8,3) (5,0)\n    (5,3) (8,0) (8,3) (5,1.5) (6.5,0) (6.5,1.5) (8,1.5) (6.5,3) (6,1)\n    (6.5,-1)[$K'$]{}\n\n-   Here (pictured below), the maximal simplices are two triangles\n    meeting at a common edge.\n\n    (0,-1)(8,3) (0,0)(0,3)(3,0) (0,3)(3,3)(3,0) (0,0) (0,3) (3,0) (3,3)\n    (0,3)(3,0) (1.5,-1)[$K$]{} (5,0)(5,3)(8,0) (5,3)(8,3)(8,0) (5,0)\n    (5,3) (8,0) (8,3) (5,1.5) (6.5,0) (6.5,1.5) (8,1.5) (6.5,3) (6,1)\n    (7,2) (5,3)(8,0) (5,0)(8,3) (5,3)(6.5,0) (8,0)(5,1.5) (5,3)(8,1.5)\n    (8,0)(6.5,3) (6.5,-1)[$K'$]{}\n\nIn both examples, the vertex sets of the original simplicial complexes\nare the same.\n\nIt can be shown that the barycentric subdivision $K'$ of an abstract\nsimplicial complex $K$ can be constructed as follows:\n$V_{K'}:=\\lbrace S\\mid S\\in K\\rbrace$ is the set of vertices of $K'$,\nand $T\\in K'$ iff $T$ is a chain of simplexes in $K$:\n$T=\\lbrace S_1,\\ldots,S_{n(T)}\\rbrace$, $S_i\\subset S_j$ for $i<j$.",
