  "definition": "A topological space is said to be *simply connected* if it is path\nconnected and the fundamental group of the space is trivial (i.e. the\none element group). What this means, basically, is that every path on\nthe space can be shrunk to a point. This is equivalent to saying that\nevery path is contractible. A simply connected space can be visualized\nas a space with no \u201choles\u201d.\n\nSome basic examples of a simply connected space are the unit disc in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$, $S^2$ or the Riemann sphere. Non-examples of a simply\nconnected space are the circle, the annulus, and a punctured plane (a\nplane with a point removed). In each of the non-examples, any closed\ncurve around the \u201chole\u201d is a path that can not be shrunk to a point.",
