  "definition": "Let $K$ and $L$ be simplicial complexes and $f: |K| \\to |L|$ be a\ncontinuous function. A simplicial mapping $g: |K| \\to |L|$ which is\nhomotopic to $f$ is called a *simplicial approximation* of $f$.\n\nFor example, suppose that $L$ is the closure of an $n$-simplex and $a_0$\nis a vertex of $L$. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $|K|$ to $|L|$ where\n$K$ is some simplicial complex. Then the map $g$ that sends all of $K$\nto $a_0$ is a simplicial approximation of $f$.",
