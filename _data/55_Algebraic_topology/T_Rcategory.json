  "definition": "An *$R$-category* $A$ is a *category equipped with an $R$-module\nstructure on each *hom* set such that the composition is $R$-bilinear*.\nMore precisely, let us assume for instance that we are given a\ncommutative ring $R$ with identity. Then a small $R$-category\u2013or\nequivalently an *$R$-algebroid*\u2013 will be defined as a category enriched\nin the monoidal category of $R$-modules, with respect to the monoidal\nstructure of tensor product. This means simply that for all objects\n$b,c$ of $A$, the set $A(b,c)$ is given the structure of an $R$-module,\nand composition $A(b,c) \\times A(c,d) {{\\longrightarrow}}A(b,d)$ is\n$R$\u2013bilinear, or is a morphism of $R$-modules\n$A(b,c) \\otimes_R A(c,d) {{\\longrightarrow}}A(b,d)$.\n\nNote:\n-----\n\nSee also the extension of the R-category to the concept of .\n\n[9]{}\n\nR.
