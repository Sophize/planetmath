  "definition": "Homology is the general name for a number of functors from topological\nspaces to abelian groups (or more generally modules over a fixed ring).\nIt turns out that in most reasonable cases a large number of these\n(singular homology, cellular homology, Morse homology, simplicial\nhomology) all coincide. There are other generalized homology , but I\nwon\u2019t consider those. There are also related cohomology theories which\nserve the same purpose with slightly different machinery.\n\nIn an intuitive sense, homology measures \u201choles\u201d in topological spaces.\nThe idea is that we want to measure the topology of a space by looking\nat sets which have no boundary, but are not the boundary of something\nelse. These are things that have wrapped around \u201choles\u201d in our\ntopological space, allowing us to detect those \u201choles.\u201d Here I don\u2019t\nmean boundary in the formal topological sense, but in an intuitive\nsense. Thus a loop has no boundary as I mean here, even though it does\nin the general topological definition. You will see the formal\ndefinition below.\n\nPerhaps the simplest form of homology to visualize, and to work with in\npractice, is simplicial homology. It is based on computing the homology\ngroups of a simplicial complex (generally a finite one). However, it is\ngenerally nontrivial to show that a space of interest is homeomorphic to\na simplicial complex, and it can also be difficult to apply more\nadvanced methods such as spectral sequences when working with simplicial\nhomology. Singular homology is similar: it is in some sense a continuous\nversion of simplicial homology, and it does not suffer from these\nproblems.\n\nSingular homology is defined as follows: We define the standard\n$n$-simplex to be the subset\n$$\\Delta_n=\\{(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^n| x_i\\geq 0, \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\leq 1\\}$$\nof ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. The $0$-simplex is a point, the $1$-simplex a line\nsegment, the 2-simplex, a triangle, and the 3-simplex, a tetrahedron.\n\nA *singular $n$-simplex* in a topological space $X$ is a continuous map\n$f:\\Delta_n\\to X$. A *singular $n$-chain* is a formal linear combination\n(with integer coefficients) of a finite number of singular\n$n$-simplices. The $n$-chains in $X$ form a group under formal addition,\ndenoted $C_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})$.\n\nNext, we define a boundary operator\n$\\partial_n:C_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})\\to C_{n-1}(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})$.\nIntuitively, this is just taking all the faces of the simplex, and\nconsidering their images as simplices of one lower dimension with the\nappropriate sign to keep orientations correct. Formally, we let\n$v_0,v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ be the vertices of $\\Delta_n$, pick an order on the\nvertices of the $n-1$ simplex, and let\n$[v_0,\\ldots,\\hat{v}_i,\\ldots,v_n]$ be the face spanned by all vertices\nother than $v_i$, identified with the $n-1$-simplex by mapping the\nvertices $v_0,\\ldots,v_n$ except for $v_i$, in that order, to the\nvertices of the $(n-1)$-simplex in the order you have chosen. Then if\n${\\varphi}:\\Delta_n\\to X$ is an $n$-simplex,\n${\\varphi}([v_0,\\ldots,\\hat{v}_i,\\ldots,v_n])$ is the map ${\\varphi}$,\nrestricted to the face $[v_0,\\ldots,\\hat{v}_i,\\ldots,v_n]$, made into a\nsingular $(n-1)$-simplex by the identification with the standard\n$(n-1)$-simplex I defined above. Then\n$$\\partial_n({\\varphi})=\\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i{\\varphi}([v_0,\\ldots,\\hat{v}_i,\\ldots,v_n]).$$\n\nIt is a simple exercise in reindexing to check that\n$\\partial_n\\circ\\partial_{n+1}=0$.\n\nFor example, if ${\\varphi}$ is a singular $1$-simplex (that is a path),\nthen $\\partial({\\varphi})={\\varphi}(1)-{\\varphi}(0)$. That is, it is the\ndifference of the endpoints (thought of as 0-simplices).\n\nNow, we are finally in a position to define homology groups. Let\n$H_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})$, the $n$ homology group of $X$ be the quotient\n$$H_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})=\\frac{{\\mathrm{ker}\\,}\\partial_{n}}{{\\mathrm{im}}\\partial_{n+1}}.$$\n\nThe association $X\\mapsto H_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})$ is a functor from\ntopological spaces to abelian groups, and the maps\n$f_*:H_n(X,{\\mathbb{Z}})\\to H_n(Y,{\\mathbb{Z}})$ induced by a map\n$f:X\\to Y$ are simply those induced by composition of an singular\n$n$-simplex with the map $f$.\n\nFrom this definition, it is not at all clear that homology is at all\ncomputable. But, in fact, homology is often much more easily computed\nthan homotopy groups or most other topological invariants. Important\ntools in the calculation of homology are long exact sequences, the\nMayer-Vietoris sequence, cellular homology, spectral sequences, and\nhomotopy invariance.\n\nSome examples of homology groups:\n\n$$H_m({\\mathbb{R}}^n,{\\mathbb{Z}})=\n\\begin{cases}\n{\\mathbb{Z}}&   m=0\\\\\n0   &   m> 0.\n\\end{cases}$$ This reflects the fact that ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ has \u201cno\nholes\u201d\n\nConsider the space ${\\mathbb{R}}P^n$, real projective space, which is\n${\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ modulo the relation that\n$(x_0,\\ldots,x_n)\\equiv \\lambda(x_0,\\ldots,x_n)$ for every nonzero\n$\\lambda$. For $n$ even,\n$$H_m({\\mathbb{R}}P^n,{\\mathbb{Z}})=\\begin{cases}\n{\\mathbb{Z}}&   m=0\\\\ \n{\\mathbb{Z}}_2    &   m\\equiv 1\\pmod 2\\text{ or } n>m>0\\\\ \n0   &   m\\equiv 0\\pmod 2,\\, n>m>0 \\text{ or } m\\geq n,\n\\end{cases}$$ and for $n$ odd, $$H_m({\\mathbb{R}}P^n,{\\mathbb{Z}})=\n\\begin{cases}\n{\\mathbb{Z}}&   m=0\\text{ or }n\\\\ \n{\\mathbb{Z}}_2    &   m\\equiv 1\\pmod 2\\text{ or }n>m>0\\\\\n0   &   m\\equiv 0\\pmod 2,\\,n>m>0 \\text{ or } m>n.\n\\end{cases}$$",
