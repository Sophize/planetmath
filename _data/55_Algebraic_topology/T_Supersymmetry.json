  "definition": "*Supersymmetry* or Poincar\u00e9, (extended) quantum symmetry is usually\ndefined as an extension of ordinary spacetime symmetries obtained by\nadjoining $N$ spinorial generators $Q$ whose anticommutator yields a\ntranslation generator: $\\left\\{Q ,Q \\right\\} = \\left\\{P\\right\\}$.\n\nAs further explained in ref. [@JSG98]:\n\n> \u201cThis *(super)* symmetry...(of the *superspace*)... can be realized on\n> ordinary fields (that are defined as certain functions of physical\n> spacetime(s)) by transformations that mix bosons and fermions. *Such\n> realizations suffice to study supersymmetry (one can write invariant\n> actions, etc.) but are as cumbersome and inconvenient as doing vector\n> calculus component by component. A compact alternative to this\n> \u2018component field\u2019 approach is given by the *superspace\u2013superfield*\n> approach*\", which is defined next.\n\n*Quantum superspace, or superspacetimes*, can be defined as an\nextension(s) of ordinary spacetime(s) to include additional\nanticommuting coordinates, for example, in the form of $N$ two-component\nWeyl spinors $\\theta$.\n\n*(Quantum) superfields* $\\Psi(x , \\theta)$ are *functions* defined over\nsuch superspaces, or superspacetimes. Taylor series expansions of the\nsuperfield functions can be then performed with respect to the\nanticommuting coordinates $\\theta$; this Taylor series has only a finite\nnumber of terms and the series expansion coefficients obtained in this\nmanner are the ordinary \u2018component fields\u2019 specified above.\n\n**Remarks:** Supersymmetry is expected to be manifested, or observable,\nin such superspaces, that is, the *supersymmetry algebras* are\nrepresented by translations and rotations involving *both* the spacetime\nand the anticommuting coordinates. Then, the transformations of the\n\u2018component fields\u2019 can be computed from the Taylor expansion of the\n*translated and rotated superfields*. Especially important are those\ntransformations that mix boson and fermion symmetries; further details\nare found in ref. [@LS2k].\n\n[9]{} J.S.
