  "definition": "A fibre map is a map of topological spaces $f: E \\rightarrow B$, for\nwhich there exists a space $F$, such that any point of $B$ is contained\nin some neighbourhood $U$ satisfying the following: on $f^{-1}U$, $f$\nrestricts to the natural projection $F \\times U \\rightarrow U$, via some\nhomeomorphic identification of $f^{-1}U$ with $F \\times U$.\n\nOne class of examples are covering maps. Another example is the map\n$SO_3 \\rightarrow S^2$ sending a rotation to the point it sends the\n\u201cNorth Pole\u201d to.",
