  "definition": "Let $S$ be a set in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and suppose that $S$ is\ntriangulable. ($S$ is *triangulable* means that when regarded as a\nspace, it has a triangulation.)\n\nIf there is a homeomorphism $h: {\\mathbb{R}}^n \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ such\nthat $h(S)$ is a polyhedron, we say that $S$ is *tamely imbedded*.\n\nIf $S$ is triangulable but no such homeomorphism exists $S$ is said to\nbe *wild*.\n\nIn ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ every 1-sphere is tamely imbedded. But in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ there are wild arcs, 1-spheres and 2-spheres.",
