  "definition": "Let $p\\co E\\to X$ be a covering map. A *deck transformation* or\n*covering transformation* is a map $D\\co E\\to E$ such that $p\\circ\nD=p$, that is, such that the following diagram commutes.\n$$\\xymatrix{ {E}\\ar[dr]_{p}\\ar[rr]^{D}&&{E}\\ar[dl]^{p}\\\\\n          &{X}&  }$$\n\nIt is straightforward to check that the set of deck transformations is\nclosed under compositions and the operation of taking inverses.\nTherefore the set of deck transformations is a subgroup of the group of\nhomeomorphisms of $E$. This group will be denoted by\n${\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$ and referred to as the *group of deck\ntransformations* or as the *automorphism group* of $p$. It is worth\nnoting that an alternative name for the group of deck transformations is\nthe *Galois group* of the covering. This terminology arises from an\nanalogy with the fundamental theorem of Galois theory which gives the\ninclusion-reversing identification addressed in the classification of\ncovering spaces.\n\nIn the more general context of fiber bundles deck transformations\ncorrespond to *isomorphisms over the identity* since the above diagram\ncould be expanded to:\n$$\\xymatrix{ {E}\\ar[d]_{p}\\ar[r]^{D}&{E}\\ar[d]^{p}\\\\\n               {X}\\ar[r]_{\\text{id}}& {X}  }$$ An isomorphism not\nnecessarily over the identity is called an *equivalence*. In other words\nan equivalence between two covering maps $p\\co E\\to X$ and\n$p'\\co E'\\to X'$ is a pair of maps $(\\tilde f,f)$ that make the\nfollowing diagram commute\n$$\\xymatrix{ {E'}\\ar[d]_{p'}\\ar[r]^{\\tilde f}&{E}\\ar[d]^{p}\\\\\n               {X'}\\ar[r]_{f}& {X}  }$$ i.e. such that\n$p\\circ\\tilde f=f\\circ p'$.\n\nDeck transformations should be perceived as the symmetries of $p$ (hence\nthe notation ${\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$), and therefore they should be\nexpected to preserve any concept that is defined in terms of $P$. Most\nof what follows is an instance of this meta\u2013principle.\n\nProperties of deck transformations {#properties-of-deck-transformations .unnumbered}\n==================================\n\nFor this section we assume that the total space $E$ is connected and\nlocally path connected. Notice that a deck transformation is a lifting\nof $p\\co E\\to X$ and therefore (according to the lifting theorem) it is\nuniquely determined by the image of a point. In other words:\n\n\\[prop:uniq\\] Let $D_1,D_2\\in {\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$. If there is\n$e\\in E$ such that $D_1(e)=D_2(e)$ then $D_1=D_2$. In particular if\n$D_1(e)=e$ for some $e\\in E$ then $D_1=\\text{id}$.\n\nAnother simple (or should I say double?) application of the lifting\ntheorem gives\n\n\\[prop:exist\\] Given $e,e' \\in E$ with $p(e)=p(e')$, there is a\n$D\\in {\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$ such that $D(e)=e'$ if and only if\n$p_*\\left(\\pi_1(E,e)\\right)=p_*\\left(\\pi_1(E,e')\\right)$, where $p_*$\ndenotes $\\pi_1(p)$.\n\nDeck transformations commute with the monodromy action. That is if $*\\in\n  X$, $e\\in p^{-1}(*)$, ${\\gamma}\\in \\pi_1(X,*)$ and\n$D\\in {\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$ then\n$$D(x\\cdot{\\gamma})=D(x)\\cdot{\\gamma}$$ where $\\cdot$ denotes the\nmonodromy action.\n\nIf $\\tilde {\\gamma}$ is a lifting of ${\\gamma}$ starting at $e$, then\n$D\\circ\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a lifting of ${\\gamma}$ staring at $D(e)$.\n\nWe simplify notation by using $\\pi_e$ to denote the fundamental group\n$\\pi_1(E,e)$ for $e\\in E$.\n\nFor all $e\\in E$\n$${\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)\\cong N\\left(p_*(\\pi_e)\\right)/p_*(\\pi_e)$$\nwhere, $ N(p_*\\pi_e)$ denotes the normalizer of $p_*\\pi_e$ inside\n$\\pi_1\\left(X,p(e)\\right)$.\n\nDenote $N(p_*\\pi_e)$ by $N$. Note that if ${\\gamma}\\in N$ then\n$p_*(\\pi_{e\\cdot{\\gamma}})=p_*(\\pi_e)$. Indeed, recall that $p_*(\\pi_e)$\nis the stabilizer of $e$ under the momodromy action and therefore we\nhave $$p*(\\pi_{e\\cdot{\\gamma}})=\n \\operatorname{Stab}(e\\cdot{\\gamma})={\\gamma}\\operatorname{Stab}(e){\\gamma}^{-1}={\\gamma}p_*\n (\\pi_e){\\gamma}^{-1}= p_* (\\pi_e)$$ where, the last equality follows\nfrom the definition of normalizer. One can then define a map\n$${\\varphi}\\co N\\to {\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$$ as follows: For\n${\\gamma}\\in N$ let ${\\varphi}({\\gamma})$ be the deck transformation\nthat maps $e$ to $e\\cdot{\\gamma}$. Notice that\nProposition\u00a0\\[prop:exist\\] ensures the existence of such a deck\ntransformation while Proposition\u00a0\\[prop:uniq\\] guarantees its\nuniqueness. Now\n\n-   ${\\varphi}$ is a homomorphism.Indeed\n    ${\\varphi}({\\gamma}_1{\\gamma}_2)$ and\n    ${\\varphi}({\\gamma}_1)\\circ{\\varphi}({\\gamma}_2)$ are deck\n    transformations that map $e$ to $e\\cdot({\\gamma}_1{\\gamma}_2)$.\n\n-   ${\\varphi}$ is onto.Indeed given $D\\in {\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)$\n    since $E$ is path connected one can find a path $\\alpha$ in $E$\n    connecting $e$ and $D(e)$. Then $p\\circ\\alpha$ is a loop in $X$ and\n    $D={\\varphi}(p\\circ\\alpha)$.\n\n-   $\\ker({\\varphi})=p_*(\\pi_e)$. Obvious.\n\n    Therefore the theorem follows by the first isomorphism theorem.\n\nIf $p$ is regular covering then\n$${\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)\\cong \\pi_1(X,*)/p_*\\left(\\pi_1(E,e)\\right).$$\n\nIf $p$ is the universal cover then\n$${\\operatorname{Aut}}(p)\\cong \\pi_1(X,*)\\,.$$",
