Any continuous function\n$f: \\textbf{B}\\to\\textbf{B}$ has a fixed point.\n\nNotes {#notes .unnumbered}\n-----\n\nShape is not important\n\n:   The theorem also applies to anything homeomorphic to a closed disk,\n    of course. In particular, we can replace $\\textbf{B}$ in the\n    formulation with a square or a triangle.\n\nCompactness counts (a)\n\n:   The theorem is not true if we drop a point from the interior of\n    $\\textbf{B}$. For example, the map $f(\\vec{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{x}$\n    has the single fixed point at $0$; dropping it from the domain\n    yields a map with no .\n\nCompactness counts (b)\n\n:   The theorem is not true for an open disk. For instance, the map\n    $f(\\vec{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{x}+(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\ldots,0)$ has its\n    single fixed point on the boundary of $\\textbf{B}$.",
