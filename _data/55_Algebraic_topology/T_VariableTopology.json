  "definition": "**Preliminary data** Let us recall the basic notion that a *topological\nspace* consists of a set $X$ and a \u2018topology\u2019 on $X$ where the latter\ngives a precise but general sense to the intuitive ideas of \u2018nearness\u2019\nand \u2018continuity\u2019. Thus the initial task is to axiomatize the notion of\n\u2018neighborhood\u2019 and then consider a topology in terms of open or of\nclosed sets, a compact-open topology, and so on (see Brown, 2006). In\nany case, a topological space consists of a pair $(X, \\mathcal T)$ where\n$\\mathcal T$ is a topology on $X$. For instance, suppose an *open set\ntopology* is given by the set $\\mathcal U$ of prescribed open sets of\n$X$ satisfying the usual axioms (Brown, 2006 Chapter 2). Now, to speak\nof a variable open-set topology one might conveniently take in this case\na family of sets $\\mathcal U_{\\lambda}$ of *a system of prescribed open\nsets*, where $\\lambda$ belongs to some indexing set $\\Lambda$. The\nsystem of open sets may of course be based on a system of contained\nneighbourhoods of points where one system may have a different geometric\nproperty compared say to another system (a system of disc-like\nneighbourhoods compared with those of cylindrical-type).\n\nIn general, we may speak of a topological space with a *varying\ntopology* as a pair $(X, \\mathcal T_{\\lambda})$ where\n$\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ is an index set.\n\n**Example** The idea of a varying topology has been introduced to\ndescribe possible topological distinctions in bio-molecular organisms\nthrough stages of development, evolution, neo-plasticity, etc. This is\nindicated schematically in the diagram below where we have an $n$-stage\ndynamic evolution (through complexity) of categories $\\mathsf D_i$ where\nthe vertical arrows denote the assignment of topologies $\\mathcal T_i$\nto the class of objects of the $\\mathsf D_i$ along with functors\n${\\mathcal F}_{i} : \\mathsf D_{i} {{\\longrightarrow}}\\mathsf D_{i+1}$,\nfor $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$\u00a0:\n\n$$\\diagram  &  \\mathcal\nT_{1} \\dto<-.05ex> &  \\mathcal T_{2} \\dto<-1.2ex> & \\cdots\n &  \\mathcal\nT_{n-1}  \\dto <-.05ex> &  \\mathcal T_{n} \\dto<-1ex>_(0.45){}\n\\\\ & \\mathsf D_{1}\\rto^{{\\mathcal F}_1}\n&  \\mathsf D_{2} \\rto^{{\\mathcal F}_2}  \\rule{0.5em}{0ex}  & & \\cdots\n\\rto^{{\\mathcal F}_{n-1}} \\rule{0.5em}{0ex} \\mathsf D_{n-1} &\n\\rule{0em}{0ex} \\mathsf D_{n}\n\\enddiagram$$\n\nIn this way a can be realized through such $n$-levels of complexity of\nthe development of an organism.\n\nAnother example is that of cell/network topologies in a categorical\napproach involving concepts such as *the free groupoid over a graph*\n(Brown, 2006). Thus a *varying graph system* clearly induces an\naccompanying . As suggested by Golubitsky and Stewart (2006), symmetry\ngroupoids of various cell networks would appear relevant to the\nphysiology of animal locomotion as one example.",
