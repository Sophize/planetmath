  "definition": "Let $(X,*)$ be a connected and locally connected based space and\n$p\\co E \\to X$ a covering map. We will denote $p^{-1}(*)$, the fiber\nover the basepoint, by $F$, and the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,*)$ by\n$\\pi$. Given a loop ${\\gamma}\\co I \\to X$ with\n${\\gamma}(0)={\\gamma}(1)=*$ and a point $e\\in F$ there exists a unique\n$\\tilde{\\gamma}\\co I\\to E,$ with $ \\tilde{\\gamma}(0)=e$ such that\n$p\\circ\\tilde{\\gamma}={\\gamma}$, that is, a lifting of ${\\gamma}$\nstarting at $e$. Clearly, the endpoint $\\tilde{\\gamma}(1)$ is also a\npoint of the fiber, which we will denote by $e\\cdot{\\gamma}$.\n\nWith notation as above we have:\n\n1.  If ${\\gamma}_1$ and ${\\gamma}_2$ are homotopic relative $\\partial I$\n    then $$\\forall e\\in F \\quad e\\cdot{\\gamma}_1=e\\cdot{\\gamma}_2.$$\n\n2.  The map $$F\\times\\pi\\to F,\\quad (e,{\\gamma})\\mapsto e\\cdot{\\gamma}$$\n    defines a right action of $\\pi$ on $F$.\n\n3.  The stabilizer of a point $e$ is the image of the fundamental group\n    $\\pi_1(E,e)$ under the map induced by $p$:\n    $$\\operatorname{Stab}(x) = p_{*}\\left(\\pi_1(E,e)\\right)\\,.$$\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1.  Let $e\\in F$, ${\\gamma}_1,{\\gamma}_2\\co I\\to X$ two loops homotopic\n    relative $\\partial I$ and\n    $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1,\\tilde{\\gamma}_2\\co I\\to E$ their liftings\n    starting at $e$. Then there is a homotopy $H\\co I\\times I \\to X$\n    with the following properties:\n\n    -   $H(\\bullet,0)={\\gamma}_1$,\n\n    -   $H(\\bullet,1)={\\gamma}_2$,\n\n    -   $H(0,t)=H(1,t)=*,\\quad \\forall t\\in I$.\n\n    According to the lifting theorem $H$ lifts to a homotopy\n    $\\tilde H\\co\n     I\\times I\\to E$ with $H(0,0)=e$. Notice that $\\tilde\n     H(\\bullet,0)=\\tilde{\\gamma}_1$ (respectively\n    $\\tilde H(\\bullet,1)=\\tilde{\\gamma}_2$) since they both are liftings\n    of ${\\gamma}_1$ (respectively ${\\gamma}_2$) starting at $e$. Also\n    notice that that $\\tilde H(1,\\bullet)$ is a path that lies entirely\n    in the fiber (since it lifts the constant path $*$). Since the fiber\n    is discrete this means that $\\tilde H(1,\\bullet)$ is a constant\n    path. In particular $\\tilde H(1,0)=\\tilde H(1,1)$ or equivalently\n    $\\tilde {\\gamma}_1(1)=\\tilde\n     {\\gamma}_2(1)$.\n\n2.  By (1) the map is well defined. To prove that it is an action notice\n    that firstly the constant path $*$ lifts to constant paths and\n    therefore $$\\forall e\\in F,\\quad e\\cdot 1=e\\,.$$ Secondly the\n    concatenation of two paths lifts to the concatenation of their\n    liftings (as is easily verified by projecting). In other words, the\n    lifting of ${\\gamma}_1{\\gamma}_2$ that starts at $e$ is the\n    concatenation of $\\tilde {\\gamma}_1$, the lifting of ${\\gamma}_1$\n    that starts at $e$, and $\\tilde {\\gamma}_2$ the lifting of\n    ${\\gamma}_2$ that starts in ${\\gamma}_1(1)$. Therefore\n    $$e\\cdot ({\\gamma}_1{\\gamma}_2)=(e\\cdot {\\gamma}_1)\\cdot {\\gamma}_2\\,.$$\n\n3.  This is a tautology: ${\\gamma}$ fixes $e$ if and only if its lifting\n    starting at $e$ is a loop.\n\nThe action described in the above theorem is called the *monodromy\naction* and the corresponding homomorphism\n$${\\rho}\\co {\\pi}\\to {\\rm Sym}(F)$$ is called the *monodromy* of $p$.",
