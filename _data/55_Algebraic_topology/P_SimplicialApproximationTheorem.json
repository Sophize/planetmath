  "statement": "Let $f: |K| \\to |L|$ be continuous function, where $|K|$ and $|L|$ are\npolyhedra having triangulations $K$ and $L$, respectively.\n\nThen there is a barycentric subdivision $K^{(s)}$ of $K$ and a\ncontinuous function $g:|K| \\to |L|$ such that $g$ is a simplicial map\nfrom $K^{(s)}$ to $|L|$ and $g$ is homotopic to $f$.\n\nThe theorem is due to J.W. Alexander.\n\n[99]{} J.W. Alexander , *Combinatorial analysis situs*, Trans. Amer.\nMath. Soc. **28**, 301-329, (1926)",
