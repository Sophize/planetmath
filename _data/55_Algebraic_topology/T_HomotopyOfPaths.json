  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space and $p,q$ paths in $X$ with the same\ninitial point $x_{0}$ and terminal point $x_{1}$. If there exists a\ncontinuous function $F: I \\times I \\to X$ such that\n\n1.  $F(s,0)=p(s)$ for all $s \\in I$\n\n2.  $F(s,1)=q(s)$ for all $s \\in I$\n\n3.  $F(0,t)=x_{0}$ for all $t \\in I$\n\n4.  $F(1,t)=x_{1}$ for all $t \\in I$\n\nwe call $F$ a *homotopy of paths* in $X$ and say $p,q$ are *homotopic\npaths* in $X$. $F$ is also called a *continuous deformation*.",
