  "definition": "Presheaf Definition\n-------------------\n\nConsider a rank $r$ vector bundle $E\\rightarrow M$, whose typical fibre\nis defined with respect to a field $k$. Let $\\{U_\\alpha\\}$ constitute a\ncover for $M$. Then, sections of the bundle over some $U\\subset M$ are\ndefined as continuous functions $U\\rightarrow E$, which commute with the\nnatural projection map $\\pi {\\!:\\!E \\rightarrow M}$;\n$\\pi \\circ s = id_M$. Denote the space of sections of the bundle over U\nto be $\\Gamma(U,E)$. The space of sections is a vector space over the\nfield $k$ by defining addition and scalar multiplication pointwise: for\n$s,t \\in \\Gamma(U,E)$, $p\\in U$ and $a\\in k$\n$$(s+t)(p) \\equiv s(p) + t(p) \\qquad \\qquad (a \\cdot s) (p) \\equiv a \\cdot s(p).$$\n\nThen, this forms a presheaf $\\mathcal E$, a functor from\n$((\\text{top}_M))$ to the category of vector spaces, with restriction\nmaps the natural restriction of functions.\n\nSheaf Axioms\n------------\n\nIt is easy to see that it satisfies the sheaf axioms: for $U$ open and\n$\\{V_i\\}$ a cover of $U$,\n\n1.  if $s\\in \\mathcal E(U)$ and $s\\vert_{V_i} =0 $ for all $i$, then\n    $s=0$.\n\n2.  if $s_i\\in \\mathcal E(V_i)$ for all $i$, such that for each $i,j$\n    with $V_i\\cap V_j \\ne \\emptyset$,\n    $s_i\\vert_{V_i\\cap V_j} = s_j\\vert_{V_i\\cap\n    V_j}$, then there is an $s \\in \\mathcal E(U)$ with\n    $s\\vert_{V_i} = s_i$ for all $i$.\n\nThe first follows from the fact that for any $U$, there is always at\nleast one element of $\\mathcal E(U)$, the zero section, and that the\ntransition functions of the bundle are linear maps. The second follows\nby the construction of the bundle.\\\n\nSheafification\n==============\n\nWe may also see the vector bundle by applying associated sheaf\nconstruction to the presheaf $U \\mapsto \\Gamma(U,E)$. First though, we\nshow that the stalk of the sheaf $\\mathcal E$ at a point is isomorphic\nto the fibre of the bundle $E$ at the point. Let $[s,U]$ be a germ at\n$p\\in M$ $(p\\in U\n\\subset M)$, and define a map\n$\\psi {\\!:\\!\\mathcal E_p \\rightarrow  E_p}$ by\n$$\\psi:[s,U] \\mapsto s_p.$$\n\nFirst, we show that the map is a vector space homomorphism. Consider two\ngerms $[s,U]$ and $[t,V]$ in $\\mathcal E_p$. These map to $s_p$ and\n$t_p$ respectively. We add the germs by finding an open set\n$W\\in U\\cap V$ and adding the restrictions of the sections;\n$$[s,U] + [t,V] \\equiv [s|_W + t|_W, W].$$\n\nOf course, $p\\in W$, so we have $\\psi(s|_W + t|_W) = s_p + t_p$, since\nthe restriction maps are simply restriction of functions. Now, it is\neasy to show that $\\psi$ is injective. Assume\n$\\psi([t,V]) = \\psi([s,U]) = s_p$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\psi([t,V]) - \\psi([s,U]) &= s_p - s_p \\\\\n\\psi([t,V] - [s,U]) &= 0\\\\\n[t,V] &= [s,U]\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, we show that $\\psi$ is surjective. For $s_p\\in E_p$, let\n$U\\subset M$ open be isomorphic to some subset\n$U_{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb R}}$ of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbb R}}^m$. Then,\n$\\Gamma(U,E)$ is the set of continuous maps $U\\rightarrow V_E$, where\n$V_E$ is the typical fibre of $E$;\n$$\\Gamma(U,E) = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^r \\mathcal C_{U_{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb R}}}^\\infty.$$\nThen let $[s,U]$ be the constant function\n$s:U_{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb R}}\\mapsto s_x$, and we have constructed an\nisomorphism $\\psi$ between $\\mathcal E_p$ and $E_p$.\\\nTo construct the \u00c9tal\u00e9 space, take the disjoint union of stalks,\n$\\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E) = \\coprod_{p\\in M} \\mathcal E_p$, and endow it\nwith the following topology: the open sets shall be of the form\n$$U_s = \\bigl\\{s_p | s\\in \\Gamma(U,\\mathcal E), p\\in U\\subset M\\bigr\\},$$\ncollection of germs of sections at points in $U\\subset M$.\\\nThen, the associated sheaf to $\\mathcal E$ is the presheaf which assigns\ncontinuous maps $\\Gamma(U,{\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}})$ to\neach open $U$. These are maps where the preimage of $U_s$ is open.\nClearly, this implies that\n$\\Gamma(U,E) \\subset \\Gamma(U,{\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}})$.\nTo go the other way, note that open sets of\n${\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}}$ are the images of continuous\nmaps $U\\rightarrow\nE$. An open subset of ${\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}}$ may be\nwritten as a union of $U_t$; $U_{ts} \\equiv \\{t_p, s_p | p\\in U\\}$.\nThen, by single-valuedness of maps, a continuous map\n$U\\rightarrow {\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}}$ must map to\n$U_t$ for some $t\\in\n\\Gamma(U,E)$, so we have\n$\\Gamma(U,E) \\supset \\Gamma(U,{\\ensuremath{ \\text{Sp\\'e}(\\mathcal E)}})$.",
