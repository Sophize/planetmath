  "statement": "Van Kampen\u2019s theorem for fundamental groups may be stated as follows:\n\nLet $X$ be a topological space which is the union of the interiors of\ntwo path connected subspaces $X_1, X_2$. Suppose $X_0:=X_1\\cap X_2$ is\npath connected. Let further $*\\in X_0$ and\n$i_k\\co \\pi_1(X_0,*)\\to\\pi_1(X_k,*)$, $j_k\\co\\pi_1(X_k,*)\\to\\pi_1(X,*)$\nbe induced by the inclusions for $k=1,2$. Then $X$ is path connected and\nthe natural morphism\n$$\\pi_1(X_1,*)\\bigstar_{\\pi_1(X_0,*)}\\pi_1(X_2,*)\\to \\pi_1(X,*)\\,,$$ is\nan isomorphism, that is, the fundamental group of $X$ is the free\nproduct of the fundamental groups of $X_1$ and $X_2$ with amalgamation\nof $\\pi_1(X_0,*)$.\n\nUsually the morphisms induced by inclusion in this theorem are not\nthemselves injective, and the more precise version of the statement is\nin terms of [pushouts]{} of groups.\n\nThe notion of pushout in the category of groupoids allows for a version\nof the theorem for the non path connected case, using the fundamental\ngroupoid $\\pi_1(X,A)$ on a set $A$ of base points, [@rb1]. This groupoid\nconsists of homotopy classes rel end points of paths in $X$ joining\npoints of $A\\cap X$. In particular, if $X$ is a contractible space, and\n$A$ consists of two distinct points of $X$, then $\\pi_1(X,A)$ is easily\nseen to be isomorphic to the groupoid often written $\\mathcal I$ with\ntwo vertices and exactly one morphism between any two vertices. This\ngroupoid plays a role in the theory of groupoids analogous to that of\nthe group of integers in the theory of groups.\n\nLet the topological space $X$ be covered by the interiors of two\nsubspaces $X_1, X_2$ and let $A$ be a set which meets each path\ncomponent of $X_1, X_2$ and $X_0:=X_1 \\cap X_2$. Then $A$ meets each\npath component of $X$ and the following diagram of morphisms induced by\ninclusion\n$$\\xymatrix{ {\\pi_1(X_0,A)}\\ar [r]^{\\pi_1(i_1)}\\ar[d]_{\\pi_1(i_2)}\n&\\pi_1(X_1,A)\\ar[d]^{\\pi_1(j_1)} \\\\\n{\\pi_1(X_2,A)}\\ar [r]_{\\pi_1(j_2)}&  {\\pi_1(X,A)} }$$ is a pushout\ndiagram in the category of groupoids.\n\nThe interpretation of this theorem as a calculational tool for\nfundamental groups needs some development of \u2018combinatorial groupoid\ntheory\u2019, [@rb; @higgins]. This theorem implies the calculation of the\nfundamental group of the circle as the group of integers, since the\ngroup of integers is obtained from the groupoid $\\mathcal I$ by\nidentifying, in the category of groupoids, its two vertices.\n\nThere is a version of the last theorem when $X$ is covered by the union\nof the interiors of a family $\\{U_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in\n\\Lambda\\}$ of subsets, [@brs]. The conclusion is that if $A$ meets each\npath component of all 1,2,3-fold intersections of the sets $U_\\lambda$,\nthen A meets all path components of $X$ and the diagram\n$$\\bigsqcup_{(\\lambda,\\mu) \\in \\Lambda^2} \\pi_1(U_\\lambda \\cap U_\\mu, A) \\rightrightarrows \\bigsqcup_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\pi_1(U_\\lambda, A)\\rightarrow \\pi_1(X,A)$$\nof morphisms induced by inclusions is a coequaliser in the category of\ngroupoids.\n\n[8]{} R.
