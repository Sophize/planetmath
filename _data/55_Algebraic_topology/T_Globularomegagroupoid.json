  "definition": "An $\\omega$-groupoid has a distinct meaning from that of\n$\\omega$-category, although certain authors restrict its definition to\nthe latter by adding the restriction of invertible morphisms, and thus\nalso assimilate the $\\omega$-groupoid with the $\\infty$-groupoid. Ronald\nBrown and Higgins showed in 1981 that $\\infty$-groupoids and crossed\ncomplexes are [*equivalent*]{}. Subsequently,in 1987, these authors\nintroduced the tensor products and homotopies for $\\omega$-groupoids and\ncrossed complexes. \u201c[*It is because the geometry of convex sets is so\nmuch more complicated in dimensions $>1$ than in dimension $1$ that new\ncomplications emerge for the theories of higher order group theory and\nof higher homotopy groupoids.\u201d*]{}\n\nHowever, in order to introduce a precise and useful definition of\nglobular $\\omega$-groupoids one needs to define first the $n$-globe\n$G^n$ which is the subspace of an Euclidean $n$-space $R^n$ of points\n$x$ such that that their norm $||x|| \\leq 1$, but with the cell\nstructure for $n \\geq 1$ specified in Section [**1**]{} of R. Brown\n(2007). Also, one needs to consider a [*filtered space*]{} that is\ndefined as a compactly generated space $X_{\\infty}$ and a sequence of\nsubspaces $X_*$. Then, the $n$-globe $G^n$ has a skeletal filtration\ngiving a filtered space ${G^n}_*$.\n\nThus, a [*fundamental globular [*$\\omega$-groupoid*]{} of a filtered\n(topological) space*]{} is defined by using an $n$-globe with its\nskeletal filtration (R. Brown, 2007 available from: arXiv:math/0702677v1\n\\[math.AT\\]). This is analogous to the fundamental cubical\nomega\u2013groupoid of Ronald Brown and Philip Higgins (1981a-c) that relates\nthe construction to the fundamental crossed complex of a filtered space.\nThus, as shown in R. Brown (2007: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702677),\nthe crossed complex associated to the free globular omega-groupoid on\none element of dimension $n$ is the fundamental crossed complex of the\n$n$-globe.\n\n[**more to come... entry in progress**]{}\n\nAn important reason for studying $n$\u2013categories, and especially\n$n$-groupoids, is to use them as coefficient objects for non-Abelian\nCohomology theories. Thus, some double groupoids defined over Hausdorff\nspaces that are non-Abelian (or non-commutative) are relevant to\nnon-Abelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) and .\n\nFurthermore, whereas the definition of an $n$-groupoid is a\nstraightforward generalization of a 2-groupoid, the notion of a\n*multiple groupoid* is not at all an obvious generalization or extension\nof the concept of double groupoid.\n\n[9]{} Brown, R. and Higgins, P.J.
