  "argumentText": "An application of the invariance of dimension theorem shows that\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ if and only if $m=n$.\nAlready this is a difficult question. (We will assume $n\\leq m$\nthroughout this article.)\n\nSimple arguments suffice for small dimensions.\n\n-   If $n=0$ cardinality is sufficient: there can be no bijection\n    between $\\mathbb{R}^0=\\{0\\}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $m>0$, as the\n    latter is uncountable.\n\n-   If $n=1$, then suppose $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$ is a\n    homeomorphism with $m>1$. Then certainly the following restriction\n    of $f$ $$f:\\mathbb{R}-\\{0\\}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m-\\{f(0)\\}$$ is\n    also a homeomorphism. Yet, as $m>1$, $\\mathbb{R}^m-\\{f(0)\\}$ is\n    (path) connected but $\\mathbb{R}-\\{0\\}$ is not connected. Thus this\n    restriction of $f$ cannot be a homeomorphism so indeed the original\n    $f$ could not be a homeomorphism.\n\nUnfortunately neither of these two arguments extends well to the cases\nwhere $n,m>1$. Indeed even the case for $n=1$ requires a reasonable\namount of work to fill in the details. However, the latter approach does\nprovide the necessary hint for a full solution.\n\nTo solve the problem outright depends on algebraic invariants from\nhomology, a surprisingly big hammer for such a basic topological\nquestion. But the conceptual steps are still basic, and we will attempt\nto highlight them in our exposition of the proof.\n\nLet $U$ and $V$ be non-empty open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and\n$\\mathbb{R}^m$ respectively. Assume that $f:U\\rightarrow V$ is a\nhomeomorphism.\n\nChoose a point $x\\in U$ (akin to the point we removed when $n=1$.) Then\nconsider the relative homology groups $H_i(U,U-\\{x\\})$,\n$i\\in \\mathbb{N}$. As $U$ is open we may apply the Excision Theorem\n(axiom) to claim\n$H_i(U,U-\\{x\\})\\cong H_i(\\mathbb{R}^n,\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{x\\})$ \u2013 basically,\nto look at a punctured open disk it to look at a punctured\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$. Now we look at the induced long exact sequence from the\nrelative pair $(\\mathbb{R}^n,\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{x\\})$ and find\n$H_i(\\mathbb{R}^n,\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{x\\})$ is isomorphic to the reduced\nhomology $\\tilde{H}_i(\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{x\\})$. But $\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{x\\}$\ncontracts to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ \u2013 and homologoy preserves homotopy\ntype \u2013 so we now have $H_i(U,U-\\{x\\})\\cong H_i(S^{n-1})$. (Puncture a\ndisk, and it deflates to a sphere of lower dimension.)\n\nNow it is an exercise in homology to prove that $H_i(S^{n-1})=0$ if\n$i\\neq 0,n-1$ and $\\mathbb{Z}$ otherwise. In particular we are using the\nfact that the invariance of dimension of spheres is (more) easily\nestablished by the homology groups.\n\nWe now repeat the process with $V$. If $U$ and $V$ are indeed\nhomeomorphic, then this process will result in isomorphic homology\ngroups for every $i\\in\\mathbb{N}$. In particular,\n$$\\mathbb{Z}\\cong H_{m-1}(S^{m-1})\\cong H_{m-1}(V,V-\\{f(x)\\})\\cong H_{m-1}(U,U-\\{x\\})\\cong H_{m-1}(S^{n-1}).$$\nThus either $m=1$ which implies $n=0,1$ as $n\\leq m$, or $m=n$. If $n=0$\nwe have already seen $m=n$. So the result stands for all $m,n$.\n\nFor a detailed accounting of this theorem together with the necessary\nlemmas refer to:\n\nAllen Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*, Cambridge University Press,\nCambridge, 2002.
