  "statement": "Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $S$ be the set of vertices of some\ntriangulation $T$ of $ABC$. Let $f$ be a mapping of $S$ into a\nthree-element set, say $\\{1,2,3\\}=T$ (indicated by red/green/blue\nrespectively in the figure), such that:\n\n-   any point $P$ of $S$, if it is on the side $AB$, satisfies\n    $f(P)\\in\\{1,2\\}$\n\n-   similarly if $P$ is on the side $BC$, then $f(P)\\in\\{2,3\\}$\n\n-   if $P$ is on the side $CA$, then $f(P)\\in\\{3,1\\}$\n\n(It follows that $f(A)=1, f(B)=2, f(C)=3$.) Then some (triangular)\nsimplex of $T$, say $UVW$, satisfies\n$$f(U)=1 \\qquad f(V)=2 \\qquad f(W)=3\\;.$$\n\n![image](sperner)\n\nWe will informally sketch a proof of a stronger statement: Let $M$\n(resp. $N$) be the number of simplexes satisfying (1) and whose vertices\nhave the same orientation as $ABC$ (resp. the opposite orientation).\nThen $M-N=1$ (whence $M>0$).\n\nThe proof is in the style of well-known proofs of, for example, Stokes\u2019s\ntheorem in the plane, or Cauchy\u2019s theorems about a holomorphic function.\n\nDefine an antisymmetric function $d:T\\times T\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ by\n$$d(1,1)=d(2,2)=d(3,3)=0$$ $$d(1,2)=d(2,3)=d(3,1)=1$$\n$$d(2,1)=d(3,2)=d(1,3)=-1\\;.$$\n\nLet\u2019s define a \u201ccircuit\u201d of size $n$ as an injective mapping $z$ of the\ncyclic group ${\\mathbb{Z}}/n{\\mathbb{Z}}$ into $V$ such that $z(n)$ is\nadjacent to $z(n+1)$ for all $n$ in the group.\n\nAny circuit $z$ has what we will call a contour integral $Iz$, namely\n$$Iz=\\sum_n d(z(n),z(n+1))\\;.$$ Let us say that two vertices $P$ and $Q$\nare equivalent if $f(P)=f(Q)$.\n\nThere are four steps:\n\n1\\) Contour integrals are added when their corresponding circuits are\njuxtaposed.\n\n2\\) A circuit of size 3, hitting the vertices of a simplex $PQR$, has\ncontour integral\n\n-   0 if any two of $P$, $Q$, $R$ are equivalent, else\n\n-   +3 if they are inequivalent and have the same orientation as $ABC$,\n    else\n\n-   -3\n\n3\\) If $y$ is a circuit which travels around the perimeter of the whole\ntriangle $ABC$, and with same orientation as $ABC$, then $Iy=3$.\n\n4\\) Combining the above results, we get $$3=\\sum Iw=3M - 3N$$ where the\nsum contains one summand for each simplex $PQR$.\n\n**Remarks:** In the figure, $M=2$ and $N=1$: there are two\n\u201cred-green-blue\u201d simplexes and one blue-green-red.\n\nWith the same hypotheses as in Sperner\u2019s lemma, there is such a simplex\n$UVW$ which is connected (along edges of the triangulation) to the side\n$AB$ (resp. $BC$,$CA$) by a set of vertices $v$ for which\n$f(v)\\in\\{1,2\\}$ (resp. $\\{2,3\\}$, $\\{3,1\\})$. The figure illustrates\nthat result: one of the red-green-blue simplexes is connected to the\nred-green side by a red-green \u201ccurve\u201d, and to the other two sides\nlikewise.\n\nThe original use of Sperner\u2019s lemma was in a proof of Brouwer\u2019s fixed\npoint theorem in two dimensions.",
