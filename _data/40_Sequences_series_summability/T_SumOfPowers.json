  "definition": "Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nA *sum of powers* is a number expressible in the form\n$$1^m+2^m+\\cdots + n^m$$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. Let us\ndenote this sum by $S_m(n)$. It is a well-known fact that when $m=1$,\nthen we have the following equality\n$$S_1(n):=1+2+\\cdots +n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$ In fact, a famous story\ngoes that, when the teacher asked the students to sum up all the\nintegers from 1 to 100, Gauss, at the age of 10, solved the problem\nimmediately. Gauss realized that the sum can be written in two ways\n$$\\underbrace{\n\\xymatrix@R=0pt@C=0pt{\n&1& +&2& +&\\cdots& + &n &&\\\\\n&n& + &(n-1)&+ &\\cdots&+ &1 &&\\\\\n\\ar@{-}[rrrrrrrr]&&&&&&&& \\\\\n&(n+1)& +&(n+1)& +&\\cdots& + &(n+1) &&\n}}_{\\displaystyle{n}\\mbox{ terms}}$$ Therefore, $2S_1(n)=n(n+1)$ and\nhence the result: $1+2+\\cdots+100=\\frac{100(101)}{2}=50\\cdot 100=5050$.\n\nWhat Gauss did is actually a special case of a method that can be\ngeneralized to the case when $m>1$. Thinking of a number $i$ as $1$\nadded to itself $i$ times, then using the following diagram:\n$$\\xymatrix@R=0pt@C=0pt{\n&1& && && & &&1&&\\\\\n&1& + &1& &&& &&2&&\\\\\n&\\vdots&  &\\vdots& &\\ddots && &&\\vdots &&\\\\\n&1& +&1& +&\\cdots& + &1 && n&&\\\\\n\\ar@{-}[rrrrrrrr]&&&&&&& &\\ar@{-}[rr]&& \\\\\n&n& +&(n-1)& +&\\cdots& + &1 && S_1(n)&&\n}$$ Using the summation notation, it then follows that\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (n-i+1)=n+(n-1)+\\cdots +1=S_1(n)=1+2+\\cdots +n=\\sum_{i=1}^n i.$$\nThen,\n$$S_1(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^n (n-i+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (n+1) - \\sum_{i=1}^n i = (n+1)\\sum_{i=1}^n 1 - S_1(n) = (n+1)n -S_1(n),$$\nand we have the same result.\n\nLet us now apply this method to the case when $m=2$. This time, we use\nthe following diagram $$\\xymatrix@R=0pt@C=0pt{\n&1& && && & &&S_1(1)&&\\\\\n&1& + &2& &&& &&S_1(2)&&\\\\\n&\\vdots&  &\\vdots& &\\ddots && &&\\vdots &&\\\\\n&1& +&2& +&\\cdots& + &n && S_1(n)&&\\\\\n\\ar@{-}[rrrrrrrr]&&&&&&& &\\ar@{-}[rr]&& \\\\\n&n\\cdot 1& +&(n-1)\\cdot 2& +&\\cdots& + &1\\cdot n && T&&\n}$$ Again, using the summation notation, we have\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (n-i+1)i = T = \\sum_{i=1}^n S_1(i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{i(i+1)}{2}.$$\nFurther algebraic manipulations give us the result:\n$$S_2(n):=1^2+2^2+\\cdots +n^2=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.$$\n\nThe general case {#the-general-case .unnumbered}\n----------------\n\nUsing the method above, one can iteratively solve for\n$S_3(n),S_4(n),\\ldots$. This means that if we know the formulas for\n$S_k(n)$ for all $k<p$, then we can derive the formula for $S_m(n)$. The\nformulas for $m=3,4,5$ and $6$ are\n\n  $m$   $S_m(n)$\n  ----- -----------------------------------------------------------\n  $3$   $\\displaystyle{\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}}$\n  $4$   $\\displaystyle{\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3n-1)}{30}}$\n  $5$   $\\displaystyle{\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2(2n^2+2n-1)}{12}}$\n  $6$   $\\displaystyle{\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^4+6n^3-3n +1)}{42}}$\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  Notice that the formula for each of the powers $m=1,2,\\ldots, 6$ is\n    always a polynomial of degree $m+1$. This is in fact true in the\n    general case, and can be proved by the method of telescoping sum,\n    together with induction: for each positive integer $n$, define\n    $$x_n:=n^{m+1}-(n-1)^{m+1}.$$ Then $x_n$ is expressible as a\n    polynomial $y(n)$ of degree $m$ in $n$. So\n    $$n^{m+1}=x_n+x_{n-1}+\\cdots +x_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n y(i)=a_m \\sum_{i=1}^n i^m + a_{m-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n i^{m-1} + \\cdots + a_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n 1.$$\n    The right hand side is $a_mS_m(n)+a_{m-1}S_{m-1}(n)+\\cdots + a_0n$.\n    By induction, each $S_k(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $k+1$ for all\n    $k<m$. But then right hand side is equal to the left hand side,\n    which is a polynomial of degree $m+1$. Therefore, $S_m(n)$ is a\n    polynomial of degree $m+1$. So we can safely write\n    $$S_m(n)=c_0+c_1n+\\cdots + c_{m+1}n^{m+1}.$$\n\n2.  Another property of $S_m(n)$ is that $c_0+c_1+\\cdots + c_{m+1}=1$\n    for any $m$. This is clear, since, one the one hand, $S_m(1)=1$ as a\n    sum of just one term $1^m$. On the other hand, its polynomial\n    representation evaluated at $n=1$ is just the sum of the\n    coefficients.\n\n3.  In addition, there are also two curious properties:\n\n    -   for each $m>0$, both $n$ and $n+1$ divide $S_m(n)$, and\n\n    -   $2n+1$ divides $S_m(n)$ iff $m$ is even.\n\n    These can be proved using the method above. For example, to show\n    that $n|S_m(n)$, use the expression\n    $$n^{m+1}= \\sum_{i=1}^n y(i)=a_m \\sum_{i=1}^n i^m + a_{m-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n i^{m-1} + \\cdots + a_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n 1,$$\n    and notice that the left hand side is divisible by $n$, and\n    therefore so is the right hand side. Since all sums with powers\n    $k<m$ are divisible by $n$ (induction), so is the sum with power\n    $m$, and hence $n|S_m(n)$. From this, one also sees that\n    $$S_m(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^n i^m=-(n+1)^m+\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} i^m$$ is\n    divisible by $n+1$ as well.\n\n4.  Since $(n+1)|S_m(n)$, we may write $S_m(n)$ as a polynomial in terms\n    of $n+1$:\n    $$S_m(n)= d_1(n+1)+d_2(n+1)^2+\\cdots + d_{m+1}(n+1)^{m+1}.$$ Notice\n    that there is no coefficient for the constant term. It turns out\n    that, when $S_m(n)$ is written this way, the coefficients are much\n    easier to express. Jacques Bernoulli gave the formula for the\n    coefficients: $$d_i=\\frac{B_{m+1-i}}{m+1}\\binom{m+1}{i},$$ where\n    $B_k$ is the $k$th Bernoulli number. The formula for $S_m(n)$ using\n    the polynomial representation with the coefficients $d_i$ is called\n    the *Faulhaber\u2019s formula*, since Faulhaber first wrote down the\n    polynomial in this form in 1631 (before Bernoulli).\n\n5.  The Faulhaber\u2019s formula can actually be extended to all real\n    numbers. In other words, $S_m(x)$ can be viewed as a polynomial of\n    degree $m+1$ in the real variable $x$ with coefficients $d_i$\n    described by $(1)$. When $x$ is some positive integer $n$, we are\n    back to the formula for the sum of $m$-th powers of integers $1$\n    through $n$. In general, $S_m(x)$ is the indefinite sum of $x^m$:\n    $$S_m(x)=\\Delta^{-1} x^m.$$\n\n6.  When $m<0$, we have what is known as the of order $n$ with the\n    special case $m=-1$ the harmonic series (of order $n$). There are no\n    polynomial representations for $S_m(n)$ when $m<0$.\n\n[9]{} A. F. Beardon, *Sums of Powers of Integers*, Amer. Math. Monthly\n103 (1996), pp. 201-213. R.
