  "definition": "A sequence $(s_n)$, $s_n \\in \\mathbb{R} $ is called *monotonically\nincreasing* if\n\n$$s_m > s_n \\; \\forall \\; m > n$$\n\nSimilarly, a real function $f(x)$ is called monotonically increasing if\n\n$$f(x) > f(y) \\; \\forall \\; x > y$$\n\nCompare this to monotonically nondecreasing.\n\n**Conflict note.** This condition is also sometimes called *strictly\nincreasing* [@NIST]. In such a context, \u201cmonotonically increasing\u201d has\nthe same meaning as monotonically nondecreasing.\n\n[3]{} \u201c,\u201d from the NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures,\nPaul E.
