  "definition": "A sequence $(s_n)$ is *monotonically decreasing* if\n\n$$s_m < s_n \\;\\forall\\; m > n$$\n\nSimilarly, a real function $f(x)$ is monotonically decreasing if\n\n$$f(x) < f(y) \\;\\forall\\; x > y$$\n\nCompare this to monotonically nonincreasing.\n\n**Conflict note.** In other context, such as [@NIST], this is called\n*strictly decreasing*. When this is the case, \u201cmonotonically\nnonincreasing\u201d is instead called \u201cmonotonically decreasing.\u201d\n\n[3]{} \u201c,\u201d from the NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures,\nPaul E.
