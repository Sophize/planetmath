  "statement": "The following result characterizes convergence of a sequence in terms of\nfiniteness of numbers of upcrossings.\n\nA sequence $x_1,x_2,\\ldots$ of real numbers converges to a limit in the\nextended real numbers if and only if the number of upcrossings $U[a,b]$\nis finite for all $a<b$.\n\nSince the number of upcrossings $U[a,b]$ differs from the number of\ndowncrossings $D[a,b]$ by at most one, the theorem can equivalently be\nstated in terms of the finiteness of $D[a,b]$.",
