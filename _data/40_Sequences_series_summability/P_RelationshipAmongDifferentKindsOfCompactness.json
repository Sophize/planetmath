  "statement": "The goal of this article is to prove\n\nIf $X$ is second countable and $T_1$, or if $X$ is a metric space, then\nthe following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $X$ is compact;\n\n2.  $X$ is limit point compact;\n\n3.  $X$ is sequentially compact.\n\nWe prove this using several subsidiary theorems, which prove the various\nimplications in stronger settings.\n\nA compact topological space $T$ is limit point compact. (Here we make no\nassumptions about the topology on $T$).\n\n**Proof.** Choose an subset $A\\subset T$, and suppose $A$ has no limit\npoints. Then $A$ contains its (vacuous set of) limit points and is\ntherefore closed. But closed subsets of compact spaces are compact, so\n$A$ is compact. Since $A$ has no limit points, we may choose a\nneighborhood $U_a$ of each $a\\in A$ such that $U_a$ intersects $A$ only\nin $a$. But this cover clearly has a finite subcover only if $A$ is\nfinite. So any set without limit points is finite, and thus any infinite\nset has a limit point. This concludes the proof.\n\nIf $T$ is first countable, $T_1$, and limit point compact, then $T$ is\nsequentially compact.\n\n**Proof.** Let $x_i$ be any sequence of points in $T$, and assume that\n$x_i$ takes infinitely many values (otherwise it obviously has a\nconvergent subsequence). Choose a limit point $x$ for the sequence; we\nmay assume wlog that $x_i$ is equal to $x$ for only finitely many $i$\n(otherwise again the result holds trivially). So by ignoring a finite\nnumber of leading terms of the sequence, we may assume that $x_i\\neq x$\nfor every $i$. Since $T$ is first countable, choose a countable basis\n$B_i$ at $x$; by replacing $B_n$ with $B_1\\cap\\ldots\\cap B_n$, we may\nassume that $B_{i+1}\\subset B_i$ for all $i$.\n\nNow, choose $n_1$ such that $p_{n_1}\\in B_1$. Inductively, assume we\nhave chosen $n_1,\\ldots,n_k$ with $p_{n_k}\\in B_k$. Since $T$ is $T_1$,\nwe may choose a neighborhood $U$ of $q$ that is disjoint from\n$p_{n_1},\\ldots,p_{n_k}$; choose $p_{n_{k+1}}$ to be any point in\n$U\\cap B_{k+1}$. Then inductively the $p_{n_i}$ form a subsequence with\n$p_{n_i}\\in B_i$, and clearly the $p_{n_i}$ converge to $q$. This\nconcludes the proof.\n\nNote that every metric space and every second countable $T_1$ space is\nalso first countable and $T_1$.\n\nAny sequentially compact metric space $M$ is second countable.\n\n**Proof.** It clearly suffices to show that $M$ has a countable dense\nsubset.\n\nClaim first that for $\\epsilon>0$, the set of $\\epsilon$-balls in $M$\nhas a finite subcover. Suppose this is false for some particular\n$\\epsilon$. Let $p_1\\in M$ be any point, and construct inductively\npoints $p_k$ with\n$p_k\\notin B_{\\epsilon}(p_1)\\cup\\ldots B_{\\epsilon}(p_{k-1})$. Since $M$\nis sequentially compact, we may replace the $p_i$ by a convergent\nsubsequence, which we also call $p_i$, with $p_i\\to p\\in M$. But\nconvergent sequences are Cauchy, so for $n$ large enough, we have\n$d(p_n,p_m)<\\epsilon$, which contradicts the construction of the $p_i$.\nThis proves the claim.\n\nThen for each positive integer $n$, let\n$p_{n,n_1},\\ldots,{p_{n,n_k}}\\in M$ be a finite set of points such that\nthe $\\frac{1}{n}$-balls around those points cover $M$. This set of\npoints is countable, and is obviously dense in $M$. This concludes the\nproof.\n\nIf $T$ is second countable or is a metric space, and sequentially\ncompact, then $T$ is compact.\n\n**Proof.** Assume first that $T$ is second countable. Choose any open\ncover of $T$; it has a countable subcover $U_i$. We use an argument very\nsimilar to that used in the above proposition. Suppose no finite subset\nof the $U_i$ covers $T$, and choose\n$p_k\\in T\\backslash(U_1\\cup\\ldots\\cup U_k)$. Since $T$ is sequentially\ncompact, the $p_k$ have a convergent subsequence $p_{n_k}$ converging to\n$p\\in T$. But $p\\in U_n$ for some $n$; since the $p_{n_k}$ converge to\n$p$, all $p_{n_k}\\in U_n$ for $k$ large enough. But this is a\ncontradiction to the construction of the $p_k$, so that a finite subset\nof the $U_i$ cover $T$ and $T$ is compact.\n\nSince any sequentially compact metric space is second countable by the\nabove proposition, we are done.\n\nThe main theorem follows trivially from the above. Note that we have in\nfact proven the following set of implications:\n\n-   Compact $\\Rightarrow$ limit point compact for general topological\n    spaces;\n\n-   Limit point compact $\\Rightarrow$ sequentially compact for first\n    countable $T_1$ spaces;\n\n-   Sequentially compact $\\Rightarrow$ compact for second countable or\n    metrizable spaces.",
