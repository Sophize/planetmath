  "definition": "Suppose that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n$ converged. Since all the\nterms are positive, we could regroup them as we please, in particular,\nsplit the series into two series, that of even terms and that of odd\nterms: $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over n} =\n \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n} +\n \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n-1}$$ Since\n$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n = 2 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/(2n)$, we would conclude\nthat $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n} =\n \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n-1} .$$ But $2n-1 < 2n$, hence\n$1/(2n) < 1/(2n-1)$, so we would also have\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n} <\n \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} {1 \\over 2n-1} ,$$ which contradicts the previous\nconclusion. Thus, the assumption that the series converged is untenable.",
