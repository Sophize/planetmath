  "argumentText": "The series has partial sum\n$$S_{2n+2}=a_1-a_2+a_3-+...-a_{2n}+a_{2n+1}-a_{2n+2},$$ where the\n$a_j$\u2019s are all nonnegative and nonincreasing. From above, we have the\nfollowing: $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_{2n+1} & =S_{2n}+a_{2n+1}; \\\\\n\\\\\nS_{2n+2} & =S_{2n}+(a_{2n+1}-a_{2n+2}); \\\\\n\\\\\nS_{2n+3} & =S_{2n+1}-(a_{2n+2}-a_{2n+3}) \\\\\n         & =S_{2n+2}+a_{2n+3}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $a_{2n+1} \\geq a_{2n+2}\\geq a_{2n+3}$, we have\n$S_{2n+1}\\geq S_{2n+3} \\geq S_{2n+2} \\geq S_{2n}$. Moreover,\n$$S_{2n+2}=a_1-(a_2-a_3)-(a_4-a_5)-\\cdots-(a_{2n}-a_{2n+1})-a_{2n+2}.$$\nBecause the $a_j$\u2019s are nonincreasing, we have $S_n \\geq 0$ for any $n$.\nAlso, $S_{2n+2} \\leq S_{2n+1} \\leq a_1$. Thus,\n$a_1 \\geq S_{2n+1} \\geq S_{2n+3} \\geq S_{2n+2} \\geq S_{2n} \\geq 0$.\nHence, the even partial sums $S_{2n}$ and the odd partial sums\n$S_{2n+1}$ are bounded. Also, the even partial sums $S_{2n}$\u2019s are\nmonotonically nondecreasing, while the odd partial sums $S_{2n+1}$\u2019s are\nmonotonically nonincreasing. Thus, the even and odd series both\nconverge.\n\nWe note that $S_{2n+1}-S_{2n}=a_{2n+1}$. Therefore, the sums converge to\nthe *same* limit if and only if $a_n\\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. The theorem\nis then established.",
