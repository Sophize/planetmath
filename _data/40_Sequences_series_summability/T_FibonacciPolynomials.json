  "definition": "Fibonacci polynomials are defined recursively as follow $$F_n(x):=\n\\left\\{\n \\begin{array}{ll}\n  1 & {\\rm if~} n=1;\\\\\n  x & {\\rm if~} n=2;\\\\\n  x F_{n-1}(x)+F_{n-2}(x), & {\\rm if~} n>2.\n \\end{array}\n\\right.$$ The main (and obvious) property of this polynomials is that\n$F_n(1)$ is $n^{\\rm th}$ number in Fibonacci sequence.",
