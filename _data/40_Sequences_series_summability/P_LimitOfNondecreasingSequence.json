Therefore\nthe set $\\{a_1,\\,a_2,\\,\\ldots\\}$ has a finite supremum $s \\leqq M$. We\nshow that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n \\;=\\; s.\\end{aligned}$$ Let $\\varepsilon$ an\narbitrary positive number. According to the definition of supremum we\nhave $a_n \\leqq s$ for all $n$ and on the other hand, there exists a\nmember $a_{n(\\varepsilon)}$ of the sequence that is $> s-\\varepsilon$.\nThen we have $s-\\varepsilon < a_{n(\\varepsilon)} \\leqq s$, and since the\nsequence is nondecreasing,\n$$0 \\;\\leqq\\; s-a_n \\;\\leqq\\; s\\!-\\!a_{n(\\varepsilon)} \\;<\\; \\varepsilon \\quad \\mbox{for all}\\;\\, n \\geqq n(\\varepsilon).$$\nThus the equation (1) and the whole theorem has been proven.\\\nFor the nonincreasing sequences there is the corresponding\n\n**Theorem.** A monotonically nonincreasing sequence of real numbers with\nlower bound a number $L$ converges to a limit which is not less than\n$L$.\\\n**Note.** A good application of the latter theorem is in the proof that\nEuler\u2019s constant exists.",
