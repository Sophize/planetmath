  "definition": "**The** *harmonic series* is\n\n$$h = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$$\n\nThe harmonic series is known to diverge. This can be proven via the\nintegral test; compare $h$ with\n\n$$\\int_{1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{x} \\; dx.$$\n\nThe harmonic series is a special case of the *$p$-series*, $h_p$, which\nhas the form\n\n$$h_p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^p}$$\n\nwhere $p$ is some positive real number. The series is known to converge\n(leading to the p-series test for series convergence) iff $p > 1$. In\nusing the comparison test, one can often compare a given series with\npositive terms to some $h_p$.\n\n**Remark 1.** One could call $h_p$ with $p > 1$ an [*overharmonic\nseries*]{} and $h_p$ with $p < 1$ an [*underharmonic series*]{}; the\ncorresponding names are known at least in Finland.\n\n**Remark 2.** A $p$-series is sometimes called *a* harmonic series, so\nthat *the* harmonic series is a harmonic series with $p=1$.\\\nFor complex-valued $p$, $h_p = \\zeta(p)$, the Riemann zeta function.\n\nA famous $p$-series is $h_2$ (or $\\zeta(2)$), which converges to\n$\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$. In general no $p$-series of odd $p$ has been solved\nanalytically.\n\nA $p$-series which is not summed to $\\infty$, but instead is of the form\n\n$$h_p(k) = \\sum_{n=1}^k \\frac{1}{n^p}$$\n\nis called a $p$-series (or a harmonic series) of order $k$ of $p$.",
