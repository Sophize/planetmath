This means\nthat (1) is absolutely convergent, and thus the order of summing is\ninsignificant.\n\n**Note.** The series satisfying the assumptions of the theorem is often\ndenoted by $$\\sum_{m,n=1}^\\infty a_{mn}$$ and this may by interpreted to\nan arbitrary summing . One can use e.g. the [*diagonal summing*]{}:\n$$a_{11}+a_{12}+a_{21}+a_{13}+a_{22}+a_{31}+\\ldots$$",
