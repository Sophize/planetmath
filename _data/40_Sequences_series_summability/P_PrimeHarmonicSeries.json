  "statement": "The prime[^1] harmonic series (also known as series of reciprocals of\nprimes) is the infinite sum $\\sum_{p\\in{\\mathbb{P}}}\\frac{1}{p}$. The\nfollowing result was originally proved by Euler (using the Euler product\nof the Riemann Zeta function) but the following extremely elegant proof\nis due to Paul Erd\u0151s [@Er].\n\nThe series $ \\sum_{p\\in{\\mathbb{P}}}\\frac{1}{p} $ diverges.\n\nAssume that this series is convergent. If so, then, for a certain $ \nk\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$, we have: $$\\sum_{i > k}\\frac{1}{p_i} < \\frac{1}{2},$$\nwhere $p_i$ is the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ prime. Now, we define $ \n\\lambda_k(n) := \\#\\{ m\\leq n : p_i {\\!\\mid\\!}m \\Rightarrow i \\leq k \\} $,\nthe number of integers less than $n$ divisible only by the first $k$\nprimes. Any of these numbers can be expressed as\n$m = p_1^{\\omega_1} \\dotsm p_k^{\\omega_k} \\cdot s^2,\\; \n\\omega_i\\in\\{0,1\\} $ (i.e. a square multiplied by a square-free number).\nThere are $2^k$ ways to chose the square-free part and clearly $s\\leq \n\\sqrt{n}$, so $ \\lambda_k(n) \\leq 2^k \\sqrt{n}$. Now, the number of\nintegers divisible by $p_i$ less than $n$ is\n$\\bigl\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p_i}\\bigr\\rfloor$, so the number of integers less\nthan $n$ divisible by primes bigger than $p_k$ (which we shall denote by\n$ \\Lambda_k(n) $) is bounded above as follows:\n$$\\Lambda_k(n) \\leq \\sum_{i>k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p_i}\\right\\rfloor \\leq \\sum_{i>k}\\frac{n}{p_i} < \\frac{n}{2}.$$\nHowever, by their definitions, $\\lambda_k(n)+\\Lambda_k(n) = n$ for all\n$n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ and so it is sufficient to find an $n$ such that\n$\\lambda_k(n)\\leq\\frac{n}{2}$ for a contradiction and, using the\nprevious bound for $ \\lambda_k(n) $, which is\n$ \\lambda_k(n) \\leq 2^k \\sqrt{n}$, we see that $ n = 2^{2k+2} $ works.\n\nThe series is in some ways similar to the\n$H_n := \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{1}{n}$. In fact, it is well known that\n$H_n = \\log n + \\gamma + o(1) $, where $\\gamma = 0.577215664905\\dots$ is\nEuler\u2019s constant, and this series obeys the similar asymptotic relation\n$\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac{1}{p_k}= \\log\\log n + C + o(1)$, where\n$C = 0.26149721\\dots$ and is sometimes called the Mertens constant. Its\ndivergence, however, is extremely slow: for example, taking $n$ as the\nbiggest currently known prime, the $ 42^{\\mathrm{nd}} $ Mersenne prime\n$M_{25964951}$, we get $\\log\\log(2^{25964951} - 1) + C \\approx 16.9672$\n(while $H_{M_{25964951}}\\approx 1.79975\\cdot 10^{17} $ which is enormous\nconsidering $H_n$\u2019s also slow divergence).\n\n[2]{} <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">M.\u00a0Aigner &\nG.\u00a0M.\u00a0Ziegler</span>: *Proofs from THE BOOK*, 3$^\\mathrm{rd}$ edition\n(2004), Springer-Verlag, 5\u20136. <span\nstyle=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">P.\u00a0Erd\u0151s</span>: *\u00dcber die Reihe\n$\\sum\\frac{1}{p}$*, Mathematica, Zutphen B 7 (1938).\n\n[^1]: ${\\mathbb{P}}$ denotes the set of primes.",
