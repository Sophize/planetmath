  "definition": "Inequalities involving the number of times at which a stochastic process\npasses upwards or downwards through a bounded interval play an important\nrole in the theory of stochastic processes. Whether or not a sequence of\nreal numbers converges to a limit can be expressed in terms of the\nfiniteness of the number of *upcrossings* or *downcrossings*, leading to\nresults such as the martingale convergence theorem and regularity of\nmartingale sample paths. As the main applications are to stochastic\nprocesses, we suppose that $(X_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ is a real-valued\nstochastic process with totally ordered time index set $\\mathbb{T}$,\nusually a subset of the real numbers. However, for the definitions here,\nit is enough to consider $X_t$ to be a sequence of real numbers, and the\ndependence on any underlying probability space is suppressed.\n\nFor real numbers $a<b$, the number of upcrossings of $X$ across the\ninterval $[a,b]$ is the maximum nonnegative integer $n$ such that there\nexists times $s_k,t_k\\in\\mathbb{T}$ satisfying\n$$s_1<t_1<s_2<t_2<\\cdots<s_n<t_n\\label{eq:1}$$ and for which\n$X_{s_k}<a<b<X_{t_k}$. The number of upcrossings is denoted by $U[a,b]$.\nNote that this is either a nonnegative integer or is infinite.\nSimilarly, the number of downcrossings, denoted by $D[a,b]$, is the\nmaximum nonnegative integer $n$ such that there are times\n$s_k,t_k\\in\\mathbb{T}$ satisfying (\\[eq:1\\]) and such that\n$X_{s_k}>b>a>X_{t_k}$.\n\n![Process with 3 upcrossings of the interval\n$[a,b]$.[]{data-label=\"fig:1\"}](upcrossingspic)\n\nNote that between any two upcrossings there is a downcrossing. Given\n$s_k,t_k$ satisfying (\\[eq:1\\]) and $X_{s_k}<a<b<X_{t_k}$, we can set\n$s^\\prime_k=t_k$ and $t^\\prime_k=s_{k+1}$ for $k=1,\\ldots,n-1$. Then,\n$X_{s^\\prime_k}>b>a>X_{t^\\prime_k}$ from which we conclude that\n$D[a,b]\\ge U[a,b]-1$. Similarly, we have $U[a,b]\\ge D[a,b]-1$. Hence,\nthe number of upcrossings and the number of downcrossings of an interval\ndiffer by at most $1$.\n\nFor a finite index set $\\mathbb{T}=\\{1,2,\\ldots,N\\}$, the number of\nupcrossings can be computed as follows. Set $t_0=0$ and define\n$s_1,s_2,\\ldots$ and $t_1,t_2,\\ldots$ by $$\\begin{aligned}\n&t_k=\\inf\\left\\{t\\in\\mathbb{T}\\colon t\\ge s_k, X_t>b\\right\\}\\in\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}.\\\\\n&s_k=\\inf\\left\\{t\\in\\mathbb{T}\\colon t\\ge t_{k-1}, X_t<a\\right\\}\\in\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}.\\end{aligned}$$\nThe number of upcrossings of $[a,b]$ is then equal to the maximum $n$\nsuch that $t_n<\\infty$ (see Figure \\[fig:1\\]).\n\n[9]{} David Williams, *Probability with martingales*, Cambridge\nMathematical Textbooks, Cambridge University Press, 1991.",
