  "definition": "The \u201cGolden Ratio\u201d, or $\\phi$, has the value\n\n$$1.61803398874989484820\\ldots$$\n\nThis number gets its rather illustrious name from the fact that the\nGreeks thought that a rectangle with ratio of side lengths equal to\n$\\phi$ was the most pleasing to the eye, and much of classical Greek\narchitecture is based on this premise. In , an aesthetically pleasing\naspect of a rectangle with this ratio, from a mathematical viewpoint, is\nthat if we embed and remove a $w\\times w$ square in the below diagram,\nthe remaining rectangle also has a width-to-length ratio of $\\phi$.\n\n![image](golden.eps)\n\n[Above: The golden rectangle; $l/w = \\phi$. ]{}\n\n$\\phi$ has plenty of interesting mathematical , however. Its value is\nexactly\n\n$$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n\nThe value $$\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n\nis often called $\\phi'$. $\\phi$ and $\\phi'$ are the two roots of the\nrecurrence relation given by the Fibonacci sequence. The following hold\nfor $\\phi$ and $\\phi'$ :\n\n-   $\\frac{1}{\\phi} = - \\phi' $\n\n-   $1-\\phi = \\phi'$\n\n-   $\\frac{1}{\\phi'} = - \\phi $\n\n-   $1-\\phi' = \\phi $\n\nand so on. These give us\n\n$$\\phi^{-1} + \\phi^0 = \\phi^{1}$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$\\phi^{n-1} + \\phi^n = \\phi^{n+1}$$",
