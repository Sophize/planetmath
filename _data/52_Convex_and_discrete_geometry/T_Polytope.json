  "definition": "A *polytope* is the convex hull of finitely many points in Euclidean\nspace. A polytope constructed in this way is the convex hull of its\nvertices and is called a *$\\mathcal{V}$-polytope*. An\n*$\\mathcal{H}$-polytope* is a bounded intersection of upper halfspaces.\nBy the Weyl\u2013Minkowski theorem, these descriptions are equivalent, that\nis, every $\\mathcal{V}$-polytope is an $\\mathcal{H}$-polytope, and vice\nversa. This shows that our intuition, based on the study of\nlow-dimensional polytopes, that one can describe a polytope either by\nits vertices or by its facets is essentially correct.\n\nThe *dimension* of $P$ is the smallest $d$ such that $P$ can be embedded\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$. A $d$-dimensional polytope is also called a\n*$d$-polytope*.\n\nA face of a polytope is the intersection of the polytope with a\nsupporting hyperplane. Intuitively, a supporting hyperplane is a\nhyperplane that \u201cjust touches\u201d the polytope, as though the polytope were\njust about to pass through the hyperplane. Note that this intuitive\npicture does not cover the case of the empty face, where the supporting\nhyperplane does not touch the polytope at all, or the fact that a\npolytope is a face of itself. The faces of a polytope, when partially\nordered by set inclusion, form a geometric lattice, called the face\nlattice of the polytope.\n\nThe Euler polyhedron formula, which states that if a $3$-polytope has\n$V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, then $$V - E + F = 2,$$ has a\ngeneralization to all $d$-polytopes. Let $(f_{-1}=1, f_0,\n\\dots, f_{d-1}, f_d = 1)$ be the f-vector of a $d$-polytope $P$, so\n$f_i$ is the number of $i$-dimensional faces of $P$. Then these numbers\nsatsify the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9\u2013Schl\u00e4fli formula:\n$$\\sum_{i=-1}^d (-1)^i f_i = 0.$$ This is the first of many relations\namong entries of the f-vector satisfied by all polytopes. These\nrelations are called the *Dehn\u2013Sommerville relations*. Any poset which\nsatisfies these relations is , so the face lattice of any polytope is\nEulerian.\n\n[3]{} Bayer, M. and L.
