  "definition": "Let $C$ be a convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or any topological vector\nspace). A *face* of $C$ is a subset $F$ of $C$ such that\n\n1.  $F$ is convex, and\n\n2.  given any line segment $L\\subseteq C$, if\n    $\\operatorname{ri}(L)\\cap F\\ne \\varnothing$, then $L\\subseteq F$.\n\nHere, $\\operatorname{ri}(L)$ denotes the relative interior of $L$ (open\nsegment of $L$).\n\nA zero-dimensional face of a convex set $C$ is called an *extreme point*\nof $C$.\n\nThis definition formalizes the notion of a face of a convex polygon or a\nconvex polytope and generalizes it to an arbitrary convex set. For\nexample, any point on the boundary of a closed unit disk in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is its face (and an extreme point).\n\nObserve that the empty set and $C$ itself are faces of $C$. These faces\nare sometimes called *improper faces*, while other faces are called\n*proper faces*.\n\n**Remarks**. Let $C$ be a convex set.\n\n-   The intersection of two faces of $C$ is a face of $C$.\n\n-   A face of a face of $C$ is a face of $C$.\n\n-   Any proper face of $C$ lies on its relative boundary,\n    $\\operatorname{rbd}(C)$.\n\n-   The set $\\operatorname{Part}(C)$ of all relative interiors of the\n    faces of $C$ partitions $C$.\n\n-   If $C$ is compact, then $C$ is the convex hull of its extreme\n    points.\n\n-   The set $F(C)$ of faces of a convex set $C$ forms a lattice, where\n    the meet is the intersection: $F_1 \\wedge F_2 := F_1\\cap F_2$; the\n    join of $F_1,F_2$ is the smallest face $F\\in F(C)$ containing both\n    $F_1$ and $F_2$. This lattice is bounded lattice (by $\\varnothing$\n    and $C$). And it is not hard to see that $F(C)$ is a complete\n    lattice.\n\n-   However, in general, $F(C)$ is not a modular lattice. As a\n    counterexample, consider the unit square $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$ and\n    faces $a=(0,0)$, $b=\\lbrace (0,y)\\mid y\\in [0,1]\\rbrace$, and\n    $c=(1,1)$. We have $a\\le b$. However,\n    $a\\vee (b\\wedge c)=(0,0)\\vee \\varnothing=(0,0)$, whereas\n    $(a\\vee b)\\wedge c = b\\wedge \\varnothing=\\varnothing$.\n\n-   Nevertheless, $F(C)$ is a complemented lattice. Pick any face\n    $F\\in F(C)$. If $F=C$, then $\\varnothing$ is a complement of $F$.\n    Otherwise, form $\\operatorname{Part}(C)$ and\n    $\\operatorname{Part}(F)$, the partitions of $C$ and $F$ into\n    disjoint unions of the relative interiors of their corresponding\n    faces. Clearly\n    $\\operatorname{Part}(F)\\subset \\operatorname{Part}(C)$ strictly.\n    Now, it is possible to find an extreme point $p$ such that\n    $\\lbrace p\\rbrace\\in \\operatorname{Part}(C)-\\operatorname{Part}(F)$.\n    Otherwise, all extreme points lie in $\\operatorname{Part}(F)$, which\n    leads to\n    $$\\operatorname{Part}(F) = \\operatorname{Part}(\\mbox{convex hull of extreme points of }C)=\\operatorname{Part}(C),$$\n    a contradiction. Finally, let $G$ be the convex hull of extreme\n    points of $C$ not contained in $\\operatorname{Part}(F)$. We assert\n    that $G$ is a complement of $F$. If $x\\in G\\cap F$, then $G\\cap F$\n    is a proper face of $G$ and of $F$, hence its extreme points are\n    also extreme points of $G$, and of $F$, which is impossible by the\n    construction of $G$. Therefore $F\\cap G=\\varnothing$. Next, note\n    that the union of extreme points of $G$ and of $F$ is the collection\n    of all extreme points of $C$, this is again the result of the\n    construction of $G$, so any $y\\in C$ is in the join of all its\n    extreme points, which is equal to the join of $F$ and $G$ (since\n    join is universally associative).\n\n-   Additionally, in $F(C)$, zero-dimensional faces are compact\n    elements, and compact elements are faces with finitely many extreme\n    points. The unit disk $D$ is not compact in $F(D)$. Since every face\n    is the convex hull (join) of all extreme points it contains, $F(C)$\n    is an algebraic lattice.\n\n[9]{} R.T.
