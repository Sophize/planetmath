  "argumentText": "The convex hull of $P$ consists precisely of the points that can be\nwritten as convex combination of finitely many number points in $P$.\nSuppose that $p$ is a convex combination of $n$ points in $P$, for some\ninteger $n$, $$p = \\alpha_1x_1 + \\alpha_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\alpha_n x_n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_1+\\ldots +\\alpha_n = 1$ and $x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in P$. If\n$n \\leq d+1$, then it is already in the required form.\n\nIf $n > d+1$, the $n-1$ points $x_2-x_1$, $x_3-x_1, \\ldots, x_n-x_1$ are\nlinearly dependent. Let $\\beta_i$, $i=2,3,\\ldots, n$, be real numbers,\nwhich are not all zero, such that\n$$\\sum_{i=2}^n \\beta_i (x_i-x_1) = 0.$$ So, there are $n$ constants\n$\\gamma_1, \\ldots \\gamma_n$, not all equal to zero, such that\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\gamma_i x_i = 0,$$ and $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\gamma_i = 0.$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{I}$ be a subset of indices defined as\n$$\\{i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}:\\, \\gamma_i > 0\\}.$$ Since\n$ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\gamma_i = 0$, the subset $\\mathcal{I}$ is not empty.\nDefine $$a = \\max_{i\\in I} \\alpha_i/\\gamma_i.$$ Then we have\n$$p = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\alpha_i - a\\gamma_i) x_i,$$ which is a convex\ncombination with at least one zero coefficient. Therefore, we can assume\nthat $p$ can be written as a convex combination of $n-1$ points in $P$,\nwhenever $n > d+1$.\n\nAfter repeating the above process several times, we can express $p$ as a\nconvex combination of at most $d+1$ points in $P$.",
