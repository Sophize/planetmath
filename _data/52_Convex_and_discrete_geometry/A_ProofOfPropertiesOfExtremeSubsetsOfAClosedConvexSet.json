  "argumentText": "For the first claim, it is obvious that $\\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i$ is closed\nof $K$. Let $z \\in A$ and $0<t<1$, $x, y\\in  K$ such as $z=tx+(1-t)y$.\nThen $z \\in A_i$, for all $i\\in I$ so we have that $x,y \\in A_i$ for all\n$i\\in I$. Therefore $x,y \\in \\bigcap_{i\\in I}A_i.$\\\nFor the second claim suppose $x,y \\in K$, $t\\in(0,1)$ and $z\\in A$ such\nas $z=tx+(1-t)y$. From the hypothesis $A\\subset B$ we have that $z\\in B$\nand since $B$ is an extreme subset of $K$, $x,y \\in  B$. Analogously\nfrom the hypothesis that $A$ is an extreme subset of $B$, we have that\n$x,y \\in A$.",
