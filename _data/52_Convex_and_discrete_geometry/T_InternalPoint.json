  "definition": "Let $X$ be a vector space and $S \\subset X$. Then $x \\in S$ is called an\n[*internal point*]{} of $S$ if and only if the intersection of each line\nin $X$ through $x$ and $S$ contains a small interval around $x$.\n\nThat is $x$ is an internal point of $S$ if whenever $y \\in X$ there\nexists an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $x + ty \\in S$ for all\n$t < \\epsilon$.\n\nIf $X$ is a topological vector space and $x$ is in the interior of $S$,\nthen it is an internal point, but the converse is not true in general.\nHowever if $S \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is a convex set then all internal\npoints are interior points and vice versa.\n\n[9]{} H.
