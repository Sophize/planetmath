Then there is a subset $P'\\subset P$ consisting\nof no more than $d+1$ points such that $p$ lies in the convex hull of\n$P'$.\n\nFor example, if a point $p$ is contained in a convex hull of a set\n$P\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, then there are three points in $P$ that\ndetermine the triangle containing $p$, provided, of course, that $P$\ncontains at least three points.",
