  "definition": "A curve is [*isothetic*]{} if it consists entirely of lines parallel to\none of the coordinate axes in a given rectilinear coordinate system. A\npolygon or polyhedron is isothetic if all of its edges are parallel to\none of the coordinate axes.\n\nAn example of an isothetic polygon is the rectangle\n$\\{(x,y) : x_1 \\le x \\le x_2,\\; y_1 \\le y \\le y_2\\}$ for some $x_1$,\n$x_2$, $y_1$, $y_2$. Examples of non-isothetic shapes are the tilted\nsquare $\\{(x,y,z) : |x| + |y| = 1 \\}$ and the bipyramid\n$\\{(x,y,z) : |x|+|y|+|z|=1 \\}$.\n\n(This entry is here because I couldn\u2019t find a definition of isothetic on\nthe web. If you know anything interesting about isothetic shapes, please\nadopt this entry!)",
