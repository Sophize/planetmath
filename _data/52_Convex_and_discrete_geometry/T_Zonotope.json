  "definition": "A *zonotope* is a polytope which can be obtained as the of finitely many\nclosed line segments in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Three-dimensional zonotopes are\nalso sometimes called *zonohedra*. Zonotopes are dual to finite\nhyperplane arrangements. They are centrally symmetric, compact, convex\nsets.\n\nFor example, the unit $n$-cube is the Minkowski sum of the line segments\nfrom the origin to the standard unit vectors $e_i$ for $1\\le i\\le n$. A\nhexagon is also a zonotope; for example, the Minkowski sum of the line\nsegments based at the origin with endpoints at $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and\n$(0,1)$ is a hexagon. In fact, any projection of an $n$-cube is a\nzonotope.\n\nThe prism of a zonotope is always a zonotope, but the pyramid of a\nzonotope need not be. In particular, the is only a zonotope for\n$n\\le 1$.\n\n[9]{} Billera, L., R. Ehrenborg, and M.
