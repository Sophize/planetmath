  "argumentText": "To simplify the notation, assume that the function is defined on the\ninterval $[0,1]$. This involves no loss of generality because if $f$ is\ndefined on some other interval, one can make a linear change of variable\nwhich maps the domain of $f$ to $[0,1]$.\n\n#### The case $f(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x}$\n\nLet us start by demonstrating a few special cases of the theorem,\nstarting with the case $f(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x}$. In this case, we can\nuse the ancient Babylonian method of computing square roots to construct\npolynomial approximations. Define the polynomials\n$P_0, P_1, P_2, \\ldots$ recursively as $$P_0 (x) = 0$$\n$$P_{n+1} (x) = {1 \\over 2} \\left( P_n(x)^2 + x \\right)$$ It is an\nobvious consequence of this definition that, if $0 \\le x \\le 1$ then\n$0 \\le P_n (x) \\le 1$ for all $n$. It is equally obvious that each $P_n$\nis a monotonically increasing function on the interval $[0,1]$. By\nsubtracting the recursion from itself, cancelling, and factoring, we\nobtain the relation\n$$P_{n+2} (x) - P_{n+1} (x) = {1 \\over 2} (P_{n+1} (x) + P_n (x)) (P_{n+1} (x) - P_n (x))$$\nFrom this relation, we conclude that $P_{n+1} (x) \\ge P_n (x)$ for all\n$n$ and all $x$ in $[0,1]$. This implies that\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P_n (x)$ exists for all $x$ in $[0,1]$. Taking the\nlimit of both sides of the recursion that defines $P_n$ and simplifying,\none sees that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P_n (x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1-x}$. The\nrelation also implies that $P_{n+1} (x) - P_n (x)$ is also a\nmonotonically increasing function of $x$ in the interval $[0,1]$ for all\n$n$. Therefore, $$P_{n+1} (x) - P_n (x) \\le P_{n+1} (1) - P_n (1)$$\nSumming over $n$ and cancelling, one sees that\n$$P_{m} (x) - P_n (x) \\le P_{m} (1) - P_n (1)$$ whenever $m > n$. Taking\nthe limit as $m$ approaches infinity, one concludes that\n$$1 - \\sqrt{1-x} - P_n(x) \\le 1 - P_n (1)$$ Since the $P_n$\u2019s converge,\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $n$ such that\n$1 - P_n (1) < \\epsilon$. For this value of $n$,\n$|f(x) - P_n (x)| < \\epsilon$, so the Weierstrass approximation theorem\nholds in this case.\n\n#### The case $f(x) = |x-c|$\n\nNext consider the special case $f(x) = |x-c|$, where $0 \\le c \\le 1$. A\nlittle algebra shows that\n$$\\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + \\epsilon^2 / 4} - |x-c| \\le \\epsilon / 2$$ By the case\nof the approximation theorem already proven, there exists a polynomial\n$P$ such that\n$$|\\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + \\epsilon^2 / 4} - P(x)| < \\epsilon / 2$$ when\n$x \\in [0,1]$. Combining the last two inequalities and applying the\ntriangle inequality, one sees that $|f(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon$, so the\nWeierstrass approximation theorem holds in the case $f(x) = |x-c|$.\n\n#### The case of piecewise linear functions\n\nA corollary of the result just proven is the Weierstrass appriximation\ntheorem for piecewise linear functions. Any piecewise linear function\n$\\phi$ can be expressed as $$\\phi(x) = b + \\sum_{m=0}^N a_m |x-c_m|$$\nfor suitable constants $a_0, \\ldots , a_N, b, c_0, \\ldots , c_N$. By the\nresult just proven, there exist polynomials $P_0, \\ldots,P_N$ such that\n$$\\left| a_m |x - c_m| - P_m \\right| < \\epsilon / N$$ By the triangle\ninequality,\n$$\\left| \\phi (x) - b - \\sum_{m=0}^N P_m \\right| < \\epsilon$$\n\n#### The general proof\n\nHaving succeeded in proving all these special cases, we now have the\ncourage to attack the general theorem. In light of the case just proven,\nit suffices to show that if $f$ is continuous on \\[0,1\\] then for all\n$\\epsilon > 0$ there exists a piecewise-linear function $\\phi$ such that\nfor all $x$ in $[0,1]$, $|f(x) - \\phi (x)| < \\epsilon / 2$. For, if such\na function exists, then there also exists a polynomial $P$ such that\n$|\\phi(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon / 2$, but then $|f(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon$.\n\nSince the interval $[0,1]$ is compact, $f$ is uniformly continuous.\nHence, for all $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists an integer $N$ such that\n$|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon / 2$ whenever $|x - y| \\le 1/N$.\n\nDefine $\\phi$ by the following two conditions: If $m$ is an integer\nbetween $0$ and $N$, $\\phi (m/N) = f (m/N)$. On any interval\n$[m/N,(m+1)/N]$, $\\phi$ is linear.\n\nFor every point $x$ in the interval $[0,1]$, there exists an integer $m$\nsuch that $x$ lies in the subinterval $[m/N,(m+1)/M$. Since a linear\nfunction is bounded by its values at the endpoints, $\\phi(x)$ lies\nbetween $\\phi(m/N) = f(m/N)$ and $\\phi((m+1)/N) = f((m+1)/N)$. Since\n$|f(m/N) - f((m+1)/N)| \\le \\epsilon/2$, it follows that\n$|f(m/N) - \\phi(x)| \\le \\epsilon/2$. Because $|x - m/N| \\le 1/N$, it is\nalso true that $|f(m/N) - f(x)| \\le \\epsilon/2$. Hence, by the triangle\ninequality, $|f(x) - \\phi(x)| < \\epsilon$.",
