  "definition": "In solving certain of equations, one may obtain besides the proper ()\nalso some [*strange roots*]{} which do not satisfy the original\nequation. Such a thing can happen especially when one has in some stage\nsquared both sides of the treated equation; in this situation one must\ncheck all \u201croots\u201d by substituting them to the original equation.\\\n**Example.** $$x-\\sqrt{x} = 12$$ $$x-12 = \\sqrt{x}$$\n$$(x-12)^2 = (\\sqrt{x})^2$$ $$x^2-24x+144 = x$$ $$x^2-25x+144 = 0$$\n$$x = \\frac{25\\pm\\sqrt{25^2-4\\cdot144}}{2} = \\frac{25\\pm7}{2}$$\n$$x = 16 \\quad \\lor \\quad x = 9$$ Substituting these values of $x$ into\nthe left side of the original equation yields\n$$16-4 = 12, \\quad 9-3 = 6.$$ Thus, only $x = 16$ is valid, $x = 9$ is a\nstrange root. (How $x = 9$ is related to the solved equation, is\nexplained by that it may be written $(\\sqrt{x})^2-\\sqrt{x}-12 = 0$, from\nwhich one would obtain via the quadratic formula that\n$\\sqrt{x} = \\frac{1\\pm7}{2}$, i.e. $\\sqrt{x} = 4$ or $\\sqrt{x} = -3$.\nThe latter corresponds the value $x = 9$, but it were relevant to the\noriginal equation only if we would allow negative values for square\nroots of positive numbers; the practice excludes them.)\\\nThe general explanation of strange roots when squaring an equation is,\nthat the two equations $$a = b,$$ $$a^2 = b^2$$ are not (but the\nequations $a = \\pm b$ and $a^2 = b^2$ would be such ones).",
