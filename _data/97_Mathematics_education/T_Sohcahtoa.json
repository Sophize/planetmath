  "definition": "Let $\\theta$ be an acute angle and fix a right triangle having $\\theta$\nas one of its angles. The trigonometric functions $\\sin \\theta$,\n$\\cos \\theta$, and $\\tan \\theta$ can be defined as:\n\n$$\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$$\n\n$$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$$\n\n$$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}$$\n\nA mnemonic device for remembering the three given above is\n[*sohcahtoa*]{}.\n\nThe sohcahtoa can be divided up into three portions of three letters\neach. The first portion, soh, should recall to memory that $\\sin \\theta$\nis opposite over hypotenuse; the second portion, cah, should recall to\nmemory that $\\cos \\theta$ is adjacent over hypotenuse; and the third\nportion, toa, should recall to memory that $\\tan \\theta$ is opposite\nover adjacent.\n\nI would like to thank Mrs. Sue Millikin for teaching me trigonometric\nfunctions using this mnemonic device.",
