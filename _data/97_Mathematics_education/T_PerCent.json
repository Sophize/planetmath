  "definition": "The may be in general interpreted to mean a \u2018hundredth\u2019. So e.g. 5 per\ncent is \u20185 hundredths\u2019, i.e. $\\frac{5}{100}$.\n\nIn practice, giving some number of per cents, one means so many\nhundredths of a quantity given in the same or being clear from the\ncontext; for example, we can say that the illiteracy in the world is\nabout 20 per cent \u2013 meaning that 20/100 of the adults of the world\ncannot read. If we say that the interest (rate) of a loan is 8 per cent,\nit means that one must pay interest for the loan 8/100 of the amount of\nthe loan in a year.\n\nIf a percentage of a quantity has changed e.g. from 12% to 15%, we must\nnot say that it has grown 3% but that it has grown 3 [*percentage\npoints*]{}.\\\n**Determination of percentage**\n\nHow many percent a number $a$ is of a second number $b$? The answer, the\n[*per cent number*]{} $p$, is obtained from $$\\begin{aligned}\np = \\frac{a}{b}\\cdot 100.\\end{aligned}$$ The number $b$ here is called\nthe [*base value*]{} and $a$ the [*per cent value*]{}(?). Essentially,\nthe procedure in (1) may be replaced by converting the ratio\n$\\frac{a}{b}$ to hundredths, which can be done formally by multiplying\nthis ratio by $1 = \\frac{100}{100} = 100\\%$:\n$$\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{a}{b}\\cdot 100\\,\\%.$$",
