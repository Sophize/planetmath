  "definition": "A *polynomial* can be defined iteratively as follows:\n\n-   Constants are polynomials.\n\n-   Variables (such as $x$) are polynomials.\n\n-   Adding, subtracting, or multiplying two polynomials always yields a\n    polynomial.\n\nThe above process always yields expressions in which variables only have\nexponents that are positive (or nonnegative) and in which variables\nnever occur in denominators or within functions such as under radicals\nor inside absolute values.\n\nIt should be mentioned that, if the above process is used to create a\npolynomial, then the process *must* terminate since polynomials are not\ninfinitely long.\n\nFor example, $x^2y^3+\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2+y^3x^2\\sqrt{2}$ is a polynomial.\nNote that fractions, radicals, and the like *can* occur in polynomials.\nIt is only stipulated that no *variables* appear in denominators, under\nradicals, etc.\n\nA *monomial* is a polynomial in which variables are being multiplied\nonly. Within a polynomial, a monomial that is as large as possible is\ncalled a *term* of the polynomial. In the example above, $x^2y^3$,\n$\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2$, and $y^3x^2\\sqrt{2}$ are the terms of the\npolynomial. As alluded to earlier, every polynomial has a finite number\nof terms.\n\nTerms of a polynomial are *like* if their variable expressions match. In\nthe example above, $x^2y^3$ and $y^3x^2\\sqrt{2}$ are like terms.\n\nWhen students are first learning about polynomials, it is advisable to\nteach them to alphabetize the variables in each term. That way, students\ncan more easily detect like terms.\n\nLike terms can be *combined* by using the distributive property. For\nexample, $$\\begin{aligned}\nx^2y^3+\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2+y^3x^2\\sqrt{2} & =x^2y^3+x^2y^3\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2 \\\\\n& =(1+\\sqrt{2})x^2y^3+\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nA polynomial is *expanded* if no variable occurs within parentheses. For\nexample, $(x-3)(x+2)$ is a polynomial since both $x-3$ and $x+2$ are\npolynomials. Expanding and combining like terms yields $$\\begin{aligned}\n(x-3)(x+2) & =x^2+2x-3x-6 \\\\\n& =x^2-x-6.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn an expanded polynomial in which all like terms have been combined,\nthe *constant term* is the term in which no variable appears (or all\nvariables occur to the zero power). For example, $-6$ is the constant\nterm of $x^2-x-6$. If no constant term appears, then the constant term\nis $0$.\n\nThe *degree* of a (nonzero) monomial is the sum of the exponents of its\nvariables. Since $x^0=1$, the degree of a (nonzero) constant is $0$.\nMost do not define the degree of the polynomial $0$; some define the\ndegree of the polynomial $0$ to be $-\\infty$.\n\nThe *degree* of a polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of its terms\nafter the polynomial has been expanded. For example, the polynomial\n$(1+\\sqrt{2})x^2y^3+\\frac{1}{2}x^2y^2$ has degree $5$.\n\nThe *coefficient* of a monomial is the numerical (non-variable) portion\nof the monomial. For example, the coefficient of $-2x^2y^3$ is $-2$.\n\nOccasionally, it may be stipulated that all of the coefficients of a\npolynomial be in a certain set. For example, most textbooks on\nelementary mathematics deal with polynomials with integer coefficients\nalmost exclusively. Other sets that are commonly used as the\ncoefficients of polynomials include the rational numbers, the real\nnumbers, and the complex numbers.\n\nFor the of this entry, only polynomials in one variable will be\ndiscussed.\n\nAn expanded polynomial is in *descending order* if the degrees of the\nterms of the polynomial are strictly decreasing as the polynomial is\nread from left to right. Note that, for a polynomial to be written in\ndescending order, all like terms have to be combined. For example,\n$x^2-x-6$ is in descending order. Since $x^0=1$, the constant term\nalways occurs last in a polynomial written in descending order. Note\nthat an expanded polynomial is in *ascending order* if the degrees of\nthe terms of the polynomial are strictly increasing as the polynomial is\nread from left to right.\n\nIn an expanded polynomial in which all like terms have been combined,\nthe *leading coefficient* is the coefficient of the term that determines\nthe degree of the polynomial. Therefore, if a polynomial is written in\ndescending order, then the leading coefficient will be the leftmost\ncoefficient.\n\nMore to come\u2026",
