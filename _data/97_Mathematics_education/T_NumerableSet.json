  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set. An *enumeration* on $X$ is a surjection from the set\nof natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ to $X$.\n\nA set $X$ is called *numerable* if there is a bijective enumeration on\n$X$.\n\nIt is easy to show that $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ are numerable.\n\nIt is a standard fact that $\\mathbb{R}$ is not numerable. For, if we\nsuppose that the numbers \\[0,1\\] were countable, we can arrange them in\na list (given by the supposed bijection).\n\nRepresenting them in a binary form, it is not hard to construct an\nelement in \\[0,1\\], which is not in the list.\n\nThis contradiction implies that \\[0,1\\]$\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ is not\nnumerable.\n\n**Remark**. If the enumeration $\\mathbb{N}\\to X$ is furthermore a\ncomputable function, then we say that $X$ is *enumerable*. There exists\nnumerable sets that are not enumerable.",
