  "definition": "In pre-college mathematics, students typically learn how to rationalize\nthe denominator (or, in some cases, numerator) of expressions such as\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{11}+2}$ and\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{x+h}-\\sqrt{x-h}}{2h}$. In to do this, they\nmultiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by an algebraic\nconjugate (or, in some cases, its negative) to eliminate the in the\nappropriate part of the fraction. Typically, the only algebraic\nconjugates that pre-college students encounter are those in some\nquadratic extension.\n\nMost students who have advanced far enough in mathematics to encounter\nrationalizing denominators or numerators have also encountered some\n(usually Indo-European) foreign . Such students are familiar with the\nconcept of of verbs, in which the ending of the verb changes to make\nagreement with the person and number of the subject. A helpful mnemonic\nfor students to the algebraic conjugates that they need to use is\npointing out to them that the procedure in mathematics is (and actually\neasier) than in foreign . The algebraic conjugates (or their negatives)\nthat they need are nothing more than changing the ending of the number.\nFor example, the way that a pre-college student is taught to rationalize\nthe denominator of an expression such as\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{11}+2}$ is:\n\n$\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{11}+2} & \\displaystyle =\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{11}+2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{11}-2}{\\sqrt{11}-2} \\\\\n& \\\\\n& \\displaystyle =\\frac{3\\sqrt{11}-6}{11-4} \\\\\n& \\\\\n& \\displaystyle =\\frac{3\\sqrt{11}-6}{7} \\end{array}$",
