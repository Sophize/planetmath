  "definition": "A ring $R$ is *Dedekind-finite* if for $a, b \\in R$, whenever $ab=1$\nimplies $ba=1$.\n\nOf course, every commutative ring is Dedekind-finite. Therefore, the\ntheory of Dedekind finiteness is trivial in this case. Some other\nexamples are\n\n1.  any ring of endomorphisms over a finite dimensional vector space\n    (over a field)\n\n2.  any division ring\n\n3.  any ring of matrices over a division ring\n\n4.  finite direct product of Dedekind-finite rings\n\n5.  by the last three examples, any semi-simple ring is Dedekind-finite.\n\n6.  any ring $R$ with the property that there is a natural number $n$\n    such that $x^n=0$ for every nilpotent element $x\\in R$\n\nThe finite dimensionality in the first example can not be extended to\nthe infinite case. Lam in [@lam] gave an example of a ring that is not\nDedekind-finite arising out of the ring of endomorphisms over an\ninfinite dimensional vector space (over a field).\n\n[8]{} T. Y.
