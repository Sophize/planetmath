  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring, and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. We say that $I$ is a\n[*left (right) primitive ideal*]{} if there exists a simple left (right)\n$R$-module $X$ such that $I$ is the annihilator of $X$ in $R$.\n\nWe say that $R$ is a [*left (right) primitive ring*]{} if the zero ideal\nis a left (right) primitive ideal of $R$.\n\nNote that $I$ is a left (right) primitive ideal if and only if $R/I$ is\na left (right) primitive ring.",
