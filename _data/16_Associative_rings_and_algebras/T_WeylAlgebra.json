Let $T$ be the tensor algebra of $V$ and let $J$ be the ideal\nin $T$ generated by the set\n$\\{P_i\\otimes Q_j-Q_j\\otimes P_i-\\delta_{ij}\\}_{i,j\\in I}$ where\n$\\delta$ is the Kronecker delta symbol. Then the quotient $T/J$ is the\n*$|I|$-th Weyl algebra*.\n\nA more concrete definition {#a-more-concrete-definition .unnumbered}\n--------------------------\n\nIf the field $F$ has characteristic zero we have the following more\nconcrete definition. Let $R:=F[\\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I}]$ be the polynomial ring\nover $F$ in indeterminates $X_i$ labeled by $I$. For any $i\\in\nI$, let $\\partial_i$ denote the partial differential operator with\nrespect to $X_i$. Then the $|I|$-th Weyl algebra is the set $W$ of all\ndifferential operators of the form\n$$D={\\sum\\limits}_{|\\alpha|\\leq n}f_\\alpha\\partial^\\alpha$$ where the\nsummation variable $\\alpha$ is a multi-index with $|I|$ entries, $n$ is\nthe degree of $D$, and $f_\\alpha\\in R$. The algebra structure is defined\nby the usual operator multiplication, where the coefficients\n$f_\\alpha\\in R$ are identified with the operators of left multiplication\nwith them for conciseness of notation. Since the derivative of a\npolynomial is again a polynomial, it is clear that $W$ is closed under\nthat multiplication.\n\nThe equivalence of these definitions can be seen by replacing the\ngenerators $Q_i$ with left multiplication by the indeterminates $X_i$,\nthe generators $P_i$ with the partial differential operator\n$\\partial_i$, and the tensor product with operator multiplication, and\nobserving that $\\partial_iX_j-X_j\\partial_i=\\delta_{ij}$. If, however,\nthe characteristic $p$ of $F$ is positive, the resulting homomorphism to\n$W$ is not injective, since for example the expressions $\\partial_i^p$\nand $X_i^n$ commute, while $P_i^{\\otimes p}$ and $Q_i^{\\otimes n}$ do\nnot.",
