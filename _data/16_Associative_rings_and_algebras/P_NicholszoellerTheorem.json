  "statement": "Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra over a field $k$ with an antipode $S$. We will\nsay that $K\\subseteq H$ is a *Hopf subalgebra* if $K$ is both subalgebra\nand subcoalgebra of underlaying algebra and coalgebra structures of $H$,\nand additionaly $S(K)\\subseteq K$. In particular a Hopf subalgebra\n$K\\subseteq H$ is an algebra over $k$, so $H$ may be regarded as a\n$K$-module.\n\n**The Nichols-Zoeller Theorem.** If $K\\subseteq H$ is a Hopf subalgebra\nof a Hopf algebra $H$, then $H$ is free as a $K$-module. In particular,\nif $H$ is finite dimensional, then $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}K$ divides\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}H$.\n\n**Remark 1.** This theorem shows that Hopf algebras are very similar to\ngroups, because this is a Hopf analogue of the Lagrange Theorem.\n\n**Remark 2.** Generally this theorem does not need to hold if $H$ is\nonly an algebra. For example, consider $H=\\mathbb{M}_{n}(k)$ the matrix\nalgebra, where $n\\geq 2$ and let $T\\subseteq H$ be the upper triangular\nmatrix subalgebra. It is well known that $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}H=n^2$ and\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}T=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Of course $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ does\nnot divide $n^2$ for $n\\geq 2$. Thus the Nichols-Zoeller Theorem does\nnot hold for algebras.",
