  "definition": "An a unital ring $R$, an idempotent $e\\in R$ is called a *division\nidempotent* if $eRe=\\{ere:r\\in R\\}$, with the product of $R$, forms a\ndivision ring. If instead $eRe$ is a local ring \u2013 here this means a ring\nwith a unique maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ where $eRe/\\mathfrak{m}$ a\ndivision ring \u2013 then $e$ is called a *local idempotent*.\n\nAny integral domain $R$ has only the trivial idempotents $0$ and $1$. In\nparticular, every division ring has only trivial idempotents.\n\nSuppose $e\\in R$ with $e\\neq 0$ and $e^2=e=1e$. Then by cancellation\n$e=1$.\n\nThe integers are an integral domain which is not a division ring and\nthey serve as a counter-example to many conjectures about idempotents of\ngeneral rings as we will explore below. However, the first important\nresult is to show the hierarchy of idempotents.\n\nEvery local ring $R$ has only trivial idempotents $0$ and $1$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{m}$ be the unique maximal ideal of $R$. Then\n$\\mathfrak{m}$ is the Jacobson radical of $R$. Now suppose\n$e\\in \\mathfrak{m}$ is an idempotent. Then $1-e$ must be left invertible\n(following the ). So there exists some $u\\in R$ such that $1=u(1-e)$.\nHowever, this produces $$e=u(1-e)e=u(e-e^2)=u(e-e)=0.$$ Thus every\nnon-trivial idempotent $e\\in R$ lies outside $\\mathfrak{m}$. As\n$R/\\mathfrak{m}$ is a division ring, the only idempotents are $0$ and\n$1$. Thus if $e\\in R$, $e\\neq 0$ is an idempotent then it projects to an\nidempotent of $R/\\mathfrak{m}$ and as $e\\notin \\mathfrak{m}$ it follows\n$e$ projects onto $1$ so that $e=1+z$ for some $z\\in\\mathfrak{m}$. As\n$e^2=e$ we find $0=z+z^2$ (often called an anti-idempotent). Once again\nas $z\\in\\mathfrak{m}$ we know there exists a $u\\in R$ such that\n$1=u(1+z)$ and $z=u(1+z)z=u(z+z^2)=0$ so indeed $e=1$.\n\nEvery division idempotent is a local idempotent, and every local\nidempotent is a primitive idempotent.\n\nLet $R$ be a unital ring. Then in $M_n(R)$ the standard idempotents are\nthe matrices $$E_{ii}=\\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\\\\n  & \\ddots & \\\\\n  &        & 1 \\\\\n  &        &   & \\ddots\\\\\n  &        &    &       & 0\n\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad 1\\leq i\\leq n.$$\n\n(i) If $R$ has only trivial idempotents (i.e.: $0$ and $1$) then each\n    $E_{ii}$ is a primitive idempotent of $M_n(R)$.\n\n(ii) If $R$ is a local ring then each $E_{ii}$ is a local idempotent.\n\n(iii) If $R$ is a division ring then each $E_{ii}$ is a division\n    idempotent.\n\nWhen $R=\\mathbb{R}\\oplus\\mathbb{R}$ then (i) is not satisfied and\nconsequently neither are (ii) and (iii). When $R=\\mathbb{Z}$ then (i) is\nsatisfied but not (ii) nor (iii). When $R=\\mathbb{R}[[x]]$ \u2013 the formal\npower series ring over $\\mathbb{R}$ \u2013 then (i) and (ii) are satisfied\nbut not (iii). Finally when $R=\\mathbb{R}$ then all three are satisfied.\n\nA consequence of the Wedderburn-Artin theorems classifies all Artinian\nsimple rings as matrix rings over a division ring. Thus the primitive\nidempotents of an Artinian ring are all local idempotents. Without the\nArtinian assumption this may fail as we have already seen with\n$\\mathbb{Z}$.",
