A prime ideal $P$ of\n$R$ is an for $M$ if $P={\\rm ann}(X)$, the annihilator of some nonzero\nsubmodule $X$ of $M$.\n\nNote that if this is the case, then the module ${\\rm ann}_M(P)$ contains\n$X$, has $P$ as its annihilator, and is a $(R/P)$-module.\n\nIf, in addition, $P$ is equal to the annihilator of a submodule of $M$\nthat is a $(R/P)$-module, then we call $P$ an of $M$.",
