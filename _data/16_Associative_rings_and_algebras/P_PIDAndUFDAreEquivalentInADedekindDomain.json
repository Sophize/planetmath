  "statement": "This article shows that if $A$ is a Dedekind domain, then $A$ is a UFD\nif and only if it is a PID. Note that this result implies the more\nspecific result given in the article unique factorization and ideals in\nring of integers.\n\nSince any PID is a UFD, we need only prove the other direction. So\nassume $A$ is a UFD, let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a nonzero (proper) prime\nideal, and choose $0\\neq x\\in\\mathfrak{p}$. Note that $x$ is a nonunit\nsince $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a proper ideal. Since $A$ is a UFD, we may write\n$x$ uniquely (up to units) as $x=p_1^{a_1}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where the\n$p_i$ are distinct irreducibles in $A$, the $a_i$ are positive integers,\nand $k>0$ since $x$ is not a unit. Since $\\mathfrak{p}$ is prime and\n$x\\in\\mathfrak{p}$, it follows that some $p_i$, say $p_1$, is in\n$\\mathfrak{p}$. Then $(p_1)\\subset\\mathfrak{p}$. But $(p_1)$ is prime\nsince clearly in a UFD any ideal generated by an irreducible is prime.\nSince $A$ is Dedekind and thus has Krull dimension 1, it must be that\n$(p_1)=\\mathfrak{p}$ and thus $\\mathfrak{p}$ is principal.",
