  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring with multiplicative identity $1$. We say that $u\\in R$\nis an unit (or unital) if $u$ divides $1$ (denoted $u \\mid 1$). That is,\nthere exists an $r\\in R$ such that $1=ur=ru$.\n\nNotice that $r$ will be the multiplicative inverse (in the ring) of $u$,\nso we can characterize the units as those elements of the ring having\nmultiplicative inverses.\n\nIn the special case that $R$ is the ring of integers of an algebraic\nnumber field $K$, the units of $R$ are sometimes called the [*algebraic\nunits*]{} of $K$ (and also the units of $K$). They are determined by\nDirichlet\u2019s unit theorem.",
