  "statement": "Let $k$ be a field and let $A$ be an associative unital algebra.\nThroughout we will assume that all $A$-modules over $k$ are unital. If\n$M$ is a right $A$-module, then the space of all linear mappings\n$$\\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(M,k)$$ can be equipped with a left $A$-module\nstructure as follows: for any $f\\in\\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(M,k)$ and $a\\in A$\nput $$(af)(x)=f(xa).$$ Note that action direction need to be reversed,\nbecause $$(abf)(x)=(bf)(xa)=f(xab).$$ Analogously\n$\\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(-,k)$ takes left $A$-modules to right $A$-modules.\nAlso this action is compatible with functoriality of\n$\\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(-,k)$, which means that it takes $A$-homomorphisms to\n$A$-homomorphisms. In particular we obtain a (contravariant) functor\nfrom category of left (right) $A$-modules to category of right (left)\n$A$-modules. Obviously $\\mathrm{Hom}$ does not change the dimension of\nspaces, so we have well defined functors\n$$D:\\mathrm{mod}A\\to A\\mathrm{mod}$$\n$$D:A\\mathrm{mod}\\to \\mathrm{mod}A$$ which are restrictions of\n$\\mathrm{Hom}$ (here $\\mathrm{mod}$ means finite dimensional modules\nleft/right modules) and are known in literature as ,,standard\ndualities\u201d.\n\n**Proposition.** Both $D$\u2019s are quasi inverse dualities of categories.\n\n*Proof.* Let $M$ be a finite dimensional $A$-module. We need to define a\nnatural isomorphism between $M$ and $DD(M)$. Indeed, define\n$$\\tau_M:M\\to DD(M);$$ $$\\tau_M(m)(\\alpha)=\\alpha(m).$$ We will show\nthat each $\\tau$ is an isomorphism.\n\n1.  First we will show that $\\tau$ is a monomorphism. Assume that\n    $\\tau_M(m)=0$ for nonzero $m\\in M$. This is if and only if\n    $\\alpha(m)=0$ for every linear mapping $\\alpha:M\\to k$. But $m$ is\n    nonzero, so there is a basis of $M$ (as linear space) which contains\n    $m$. In particular there is a linear mapping $f:M\\to k$ such that\n    $f(m)=1$. Contradiction. Thus $m=0$, which completes this part.\n\n2.  $\\tau$ is an epimorphism. Indeed, let $F:D(M)\\to k$ be a linear\n    mapping. We need to show, that there is $m\\in M$ such that\n    $$F(\\alpha)=\\alpha(m)$$ for any $\\alpha\\in D(M)$. Since $M$ is\n    finite dimensional, then let $\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\}$ be a $k$-basis of\n    $M$. Of course $\\{e_1^*,\\ldots,e_n^*\\}$ is a basis of $D(M)$, where\n    $e_i^*$ is given by $e_i^*(e_j)=1$ if $i=j$ and $e_i^*(e_j)=0$\n    otherwise. Define $$\\lambda_i=F(e_i^*)$$ and put\n    $$m=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\lambda_i\\cdot e_i.$$ We leave it as a simple\n    exercise, that $\\tau(m)=F$.\n\nWhat remains is to prove, that $\\tau$ is natural. Consider an\n$A$-homomorphism $f:X\\to Y$. We need to show that the following diagram\ncommutes: $$\\xymatrix{\nX\\ar[r]^f\\ar[d]_{\\tau_X} & Y\\ar[d]^{\\tau_Y}\\\\\nDD(X)\\ar[r]^{DD(f)} & DD(Y)\n}$$ Indeed, if $x\\in X$, then let $F=\\tau_X(x)$. We have that\n$$DD(f)(F)=F\\circ D(f)$$ and evaluating this at $\\alpha\\in D(M)$ we have\n$$F(D(f)(\\alpha))=F(\\alpha\\circ f)=(\\alpha\\circ f)(x)=\\alpha(f(x)) = \\tau_Y(f(x))(\\alpha).$$\nIn particular we obtain that $$DD(f)(\\tau_X(x))=\\tau_Y(f(x))$$ which\nmeans that $$DD(f)\\circ\\tau_X=\\tau_Y\\circ f$$ which completes the proof.\n$\\square$",
