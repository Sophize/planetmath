  "definition": "A ring is said to be *semiprimitive* if its Jacobson radical is the zero\nideal.\n\nAny simple ring is automatically semiprimitive.\n\nA finite direct product of matrix rings over division rings can be shown\nto be semiprimitive and both left and right Artinian.\n\nThe states that any semiprimitive ring which is left or right Artinian\nis isomorphic to a finite direct product of matrix rings over division\nrings.\n\n[**Note**]{}: The semiprimitive condition is sometimes also referred to\nas a *semisimple*, *Jacobson semisimple*, or *J-semisimple*.\nFurthermore, when either of the last two names are used, the adjective\n\u2019semisimple\u2019 is frequently intended to refer to a ring that is\nsemiprimitive and Artinian (see the entry on ).",
