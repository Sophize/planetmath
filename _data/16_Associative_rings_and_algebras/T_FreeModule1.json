  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. A [*free module*]{} over $R$ is a direct sum of\ncopies of $R$.\n\nSimilarly, as an abelian group is simply a module over $\\Bbb{Z}$, a\n[*free abelian group*]{} is a direct sum of copies of $\\Bbb{Z}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the module has a [*free basis*]{},\ni.e. a set of elements with the property that every element of the\nmodule can be uniquely expressed as an linear combination over $R$ of\nelements of the free basis.\n\nEvery free module is also a projective module, as well as a flat module.",
