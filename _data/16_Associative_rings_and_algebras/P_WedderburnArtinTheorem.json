  "statement": "If $R$ is a left semisimple ring, then\n$$R \\cong \\mathbb{M}_{n_1}(D_1) \\times \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\times \\mathbb{M}_{n_r}(D_r)$$\nwhere each $D_i$ is a division ring and $\\mathbb{M}_{n_i}(D_i)$ is the\nmatrix ring over $D_i$, $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, r$. The positive integer $r$\nis unique, and so are the division rings (up to permutation).\n\nSome immediate consequences of this theorem:\n\n-   A Artinian ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a division ring.\n\n-   A commutative semisimple ring is a finite direct product of fields.\n\nThis theorem is a special case of the more general theorem on\nsemiprimitive rings.",
