  "definition": "It is a well-known fact that a polynomial (over, say, $\\mathbb{Z}$) can\nbe written as a sum of monomials in a unique way. A monomial is a\nspecial kind of a polynomial. Unlike polynomials, the monomials can be\npartitioned so that the sum of any two monomial within a partition, and\nthe product of any two monomials, are again monomials. As one may have\nguessed, one would partition the monomials by their degree. The above\nnotion can be generalized, and the general notion is that of a graded\nring (and a graded module).\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nLet $R = R_0 \\oplus R_1 \\oplus \\cdots$ be a graded ring. A module $M$\nover $R$ is said to be a *graded module* if\n$$M = M_0 \\oplus M_1 \\oplus \\cdots$$ where $M_i$ are abelian subgroups\nof $M$, such that $R_i M_j \\subseteq M_{i+j}$ for all $i,j$. An element\nof $M$ is said to be *homogeneous of degree* $i$ if it is in $M_i$. The\nset of $M_i$ is called a *grading* of $M$.\n\nWhenever we speak of a graded module, the module is always assumed to be\nover a graded ring. As any ring $R$ is trivially a graded ring (where\n$R_i=R$ if $i=0$ and $R_i=0$ otherwise), every module $M$ is trivially a\ngraded module with $M_i=M$ if $i=0$ and $M_i=0$ otherwise. However, it\nis customary to regard a graded module (or a graded ring) non-trivially.\n\nIf $R$ is a graded ring, then clearly it is a graded module over itself,\nby setting $M_i=R_i$ ($M=R$ in this case). Furthermore, if $M$ is graded\nover $R$, then so is $Mz$ for any indeterminate $z$.\n\n**Example**. To see a concrete example of a graded module, let us first\nconstruct a graded ring. For convenience, take any ring $R$, the\npolynomial ring $S=R[x]$ is a graded ring, as\n$$S=S_0\\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus S_n \\oplus \\cdots,$$\nwith $S_i:=Rx^i$. Then $S_iS_j=(Rx^m)(Rx^n)\\subseteq Rx^{m+n}=S_{i+j}$.\n\nTherefore, $S$ is a graded module over $S$. Similarly, the submodules\n$Sx^i$ of $S$ are also graded over $S$.\n\nIt is possible for a module over a graded ring to be graded in more than\none way. Let $S$ be defined as in the example above. Then $S[y]$ is\ngraded over $S$. One way to grade $S[y]$ is the following:\n$$S[y]=\\bigoplus_{k=0}^{\\infty} A_k,\\quad\\textrm{ where }A_k=R[y]x^k,$$\nsince $S_pA_q=(Rx^p)(R[y]x^q)\\subseteq R[y]x^{p+q}=A_{p+q}$. Another way\nto grade $S[y]$ is:\n$$S[y]=\\bigoplus_{k=0}^{\\infty} B_k,\\quad\\textrm{ where }B_k=\\sum_{i+j=k}Rx^iy^j,$$\nsince\n$$S_pB_q=(Rx^p)(\\sum_{i+j=q}Rx^iy^j)=\\sum_{i+j=q}Rx^{i+p}y^j\\subseteq \\sum_{i+j=p+q}Rx^iy^j=B_{p+q}.$$\n\n### Graded homomorphisms and graded submodules {#graded-homomorphisms-and-graded-submodules .unnumbered}\n\nLet $M,N$ be graded modules over a (graded) ring $R$. A module\nhomomorphism $f:M\\to N$ is said to be *graded* if $f(M_i)\\subseteq N_i$.\n$f$ is a *graded isomorphism* if it is a graded module homomorphism and\nan isomorphism. If $f$ is a graded isomorphism $M\\to N$, then\n\n1.  $f(M_i)=N_i$. Suppose $a\\in N_i$ and $f(b)=a$. Write $b=\\sum b_j$\n    where $b_j\\in M_i$, and $b_j=0$ for all but finitely many $j$. Then\n    each $f(b_j)\\in N_j$. Since $N_j\\cap N_i=0$ if $i\\ne j$, $f(b_j)=0$\n    if $j\\ne i$. Therefore $b=b_i\\in N_i$.\n\n2.  $f^{-1}$ is graded. If $a\\in f^{-1}(N_i)$, then $f(a)\\in N_i=f(M_i)$\n    by the previous fact. Then $f(a)=f(c)$ for some $c\\in M_i$, so\n    $a=c\\in M_i$ since $f$ is one-to-one.\n\nSuppose a graded module $M$ has two gradings: $M=\\oplus A_i=\\oplus B_i$.\nThe two gradings on $M$ are said to be *isomorphic* if there is a graded\nisomorphism $f$ on $M$ with $f(A_j)=B_j$. In the example above, we see\nthat the two gradings of $S[j]$ are non-isomorphic.\n\nLet $N$ be a submodule of a graded module $M$ (over $R$). We can turn\n$N$ into a graded module by defining $N_i=N\\cap M_i$. Of course, $N$ may\nalready be a graded module in the first place. But the two gradings on\n$N$ may not be isomorphic. A submodule $N$ of a graded module $M$ (over\n$R$) is said to be a *graded submodule* of $M$ if its grading is defined\nby $N_i=N\\cap M_i$. If $N$ is a graded submodule of $M$, then the\ninjection $N\\mapsto M$ is a graded homomorphism.\n\n### Generalization {#generalization .unnumbered}\n\nThe above definition can be generalized, and the generalization comes\nfrom the subscripts. The set of subscripts in the definition above is\njust the set of all non-negative integers (sometimes denoted\n$\\mathbb{N}$) with a binary operation $+$. It is reasonable to extend\nthe set of subscripts from $\\mathbb{N}$ to an arbitrary set $S$ with a\nbinary operation $*$. Normally, we require that $*$ is associative so\nthat $S$ is a semigroup. An $R$-module $M$ is said to be $S$-graded if\n$$M=\\bigoplus_{s\\in S}M_s\\textrm{ such that }R_sM_t\\subseteq M_{s*t}.$$\nExamples of $S$-graded modules are mainly found in modules over a\nsemigroup ring $R[S]$.\n\n**Remark**. Graded modules, and in general the concept of grading in\nalgebra, are an essential tool in the study of homological algebraic\naspect of rings.",
