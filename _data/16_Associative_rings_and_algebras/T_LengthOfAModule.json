  "definition": "Let $A$ be a ring and let $M$ be an $A$-module. If there is a finite\nsequence of submodules of $M$ $$\\begin{aligned}\nM=M_0\\supset M_1\\supset \\cdots \\supset M_n=0\\end{aligned}$$ such that\neach quotient module $M_i/M_{i+1}$ is simple, then $n$ is necessarily\nunique by the for modules. We define the above number $n$ to be the\n*length* of $M$. If such a finite sequence does not exist, then the\nlength of $M$ is defined to be $\\infty$.\n\nIf $M$ has finite length, then $M$ satisfies both the ascending and\ndescending chain conditions.\n\nA ring $A$ is said to have *finite length* if there is an $A$-module\nwhose length is finite.",
