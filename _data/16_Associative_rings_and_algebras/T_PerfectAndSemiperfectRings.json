  "definition": "A ring $R$ is called **left/right perfect** if for any left/right\n$R$-module $M$ there exists a projective cover $p:P\\to M$.\n\nA ring $R$ is called **left/right semiperfect** if for any left/right\nfinitely-generated $R$-module $M$ there exists a projective cover\n$p:P\\to M$.\n\nIt can be shown that there are rings which are left perfect, but not\nright perfect. However being semiperfect is left-right symmetric\nproperty.\n\nSome examples of semiperfect rings include:\n\n1.  perfect rings;\n\n2.  left/right Artinian rings;\n\n3.  finite-dimensional algebras over a field $k$.",
