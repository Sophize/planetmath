  "statement": "The Koethe Conjecture is the statement that for any pair of nil right\nideals $A$ and $B$ in any ring $R$, the sum $A + B$ is also nil.\n\nIf either of $A$ or $B$ is a two-sided ideal, it is easy to see that\n$A + B$ is nil. (See properties of nil and nilpotent ideals.)\n\nIn particular, this means that the Koethe conjecture is true for\ncommutative rings.\n\nIt has been shown to be true for many classes of rings, but the general\nstatement is still unproven, and no counter example has been found.",
