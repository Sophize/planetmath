  "definition": "Matrix Rings\n------------\n\nA ring $R$ is said to be a *matrix ring* if there is a ring $S$ and a\npositive integer $n$ such that $$R\\cong M_n(S),$$ the ring of\n$n\\times n$ matrices with entries as elements of $S$. Usually, we simply\nidentify $R$ with $M_n(S)$.\n\nGenerally, one is interested to find out if a given ring $R$ is a matrix\nring. By setting $n=1$, we see that every ring is trivially a matrix\nring. Therefore, to exclude these trivial cases, we call a ring $R$ a\n*trivial matrix ring* if there does not exist an $n>1$ such that\n$R\\cong M_n(S)$. Now the question becomes: is $R$ a non-trivial matrix\nring?\n\nActually, the requirement that $S$ be a ring in the above definition is\nredundent. It is enough to define $S$ to be simply a set with two binary\noperations $+$ and $\\cdot$. Fix a positive integer $n\\ge 1$, define the\nset of formal $n\\times n$ matrices $M_n(S)$ with coefficients in $S$.\nAddition and multiplication on $M_n(S)$ are defined as the usual matrix\naddition and multiplication, induced by $+$ and $\\cdot$ of $S$\nrespectively. By abuse of notation, we use $+$ and $\\cdot$ to denote\naddition and multiplication on $M_n(S)$. We have the following:\n\n1.  If $M_n(S)$ with $+$ is an abelian group, then so is $S$.\n\n2.  If in addition, $M_n(S)$ with both $+$ and $\\cdot$ is a ring, then\n    so is $S$.\n\n3.  If $M_n(S)$ is unital (has a multiplicative identity), then so is\n    $S$.\n\nThe first two assertions above are easily observed. To see how the last\none roughly works, assume $E$ is the multiplicative identity of\n$M_n(S)$. Next define $U(a,i,j)$ to be the matrix whose $(i,j)$-cell is\n$a\\in S$ and $0$ everywhere else. Using cell entries $e_{st}$ from $E$,\nwe solve the system of equations\n$$U(e_{st},i,j)E=U(e_{st},i,j)=EU(e_{st},i,j)$$ to conclude that $E$\ntakes the form of a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are all the\nsame element $e\\in S$. Furthermore, this $e$ is an idempotent. From\nthis, it is easy to derive that $e$ is in fact a multiplicative identity\nof $S$ (multiply an element of the form $U(a,1,1)$, where $a$ is an\narbitrary element in $S$). The converse of all three assertions are\nclearly true too.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   It can be shown that if $R$ is a unital ring having a finite\n    doubly-indexed set $T=\\lbrace e_{ij} \\mid 1\\le i,j\\le n\\rbrace$ such\n    that\n\n    1.  $e_{ij}e_{k\\ell}=\\delta_{jk}e_{i\\ell}$ where $\\delta_{jk}$\n        denotes the Kronecker delta, and\n\n    2.  $\\sum e_{ij}=1$,\n\n    then $R$ is a matrix ring. In fact, $R\\cong M_n(S)$, where $S$ is\n    the centralizer of $T$.\n\n-   A unital matrix ring $R=M_n(S)$ is isomorphic to the ring of\n    endomorphisms of the free module $S^n$. If $S$ has IBN, then\n    $M_n(S)\\cong M_m(S)$ implies that $n=m$. It can also be shown that\n    $S$ has IBN iff $R$ does.\n\n-   Any ring $S$ is Morita equivalent to the matrix ring $M_n(S)$ for\n    any positive integer $n$.\n\nMatrix Groups\n-------------\n\nSuppose $R=M_n(S)$ is unital. $U(R)$, the group of units of $R$, being\nisomorphic to the group of automorphisms of $S^n$, is called the\n*general linear group* of $S^n$. A *matrix group* is a subgroup of\n$U(R)$ for some matrix ring $R$. If $S$ is a field, in particular, the\nfield of real numbers or complex numbers, matrix groups are sometimes\nalso called classical groups, as they were studied as far back as the\n1800\u2019s under the name groups of tranformations, before the formal\nconcept of a group was introduced.",
