  "statement": "**Theorem.** In a commutative ring with non-zero unity, any maximal\nideal is a prime ideal.\n\n[*Proof.*]{} Let $\\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of such a ring $R$\nand let the ring product $rs$ belong to $\\mathfrak{m}$ but e.g.\n$r \\notin \\mathfrak{m}$. The maximality of $\\mathfrak{m}$ implies that\n$\\mathfrak{m}\\!+\\!(r) = R = (1)$. Thus there exists an element\n$m \\in \\mathfrak{m}$ and an element $x \\in R$ such that $m\\!+\\!xr = 1$.\nNow $m$ and $rs$ belong to $\\mathfrak{m}$, whence\n$$s = 1s = (m\\!+\\!xr)s = sm\\!+\\!x(rs) \\in \\mathfrak{m}.$$ So we can say\nthat along with $rs$, at least one of its belongs to $\\mathfrak{m}$, and\ntherefore $\\mathfrak{m}$ is a prime ideal of $R$.",
