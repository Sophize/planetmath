  "definition": "A ring $R$ is *semi-local* if $R/rad(R)$ is an Artinian ring, where\n$rad(R)$ denotes the Jacobson radical of $R$. In the case that $R$ is\ncommutative, this reduces to the definition that $R$ is *semi-local* if\n$R$ has finitely many maximal ideals. Note that finite rings are\ntrivially semi-local.",
