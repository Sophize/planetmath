  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space and let $K$ be a simplicial approximation\nto $X$. An *$n$-chain* on $X$ is a finite formal sum of oriented\n$n$-simplices in $K$. The group of such chains is denoted by $C_n(X)$\nand is called the $n$th *chain group* of $X$. In other words, $C_n(X)$\nis the free abelian group generated by the oriented $n$-simplices in\n$K$.\n\nWe have defined chain groups for simplicial homology. Their definition\nis similar in singular homology and the homology of CW complexes. For\nexample, if $Y$ is a CW complex, then its $n$th chain group is the free\nabelian group on the cells of $Y^n$, the $n$-skeleton of $Y$.\n\nThe formal *boundary* of an oriented $n$-simplex\n$\\sigma=(v_0,\\dots,v_n)$ is given by the alternating sum of the oriented\n$n$-simplices forming the topological boundary of $\\sigma$, that is,\n$$\\partial_n(\\sigma) = \\sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j (v_0,\\dots, v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\\dots, v_n).$$\nThe boundary of a $0$-simplex is $0$.\n\nSince $n$-simplices form a basis for the chain group $C_n(X)$, this\nextends to give a group homomorphism\n$\\partial_n\\colon C_n(X)\\to C_{n-1}(X)$, called the *boundary map*. An\n$n$-chain is *closed* if its boundary is 0 and *exact* if it is the\nboundary of some $(n+1)$-chain. Closed $n$-chains are also called\n*cycles*. Every exact $n$-chain is also closed. This implies that the\nsequence $$\\xymatrix{\n\\cdots \\ar[r] & C_{n+1}(X)\\ar[r]^{\\partial_{n+1}} & C_n(X)\\ar[r]^{\\partial_n} & C_{n-1}\\ar[r] & \\cdots\n}$$ is a complex of free abelian groups. This complex is usually called\nthe *chain complex* of $X$ corresponding to the simplicial complex $K$.\nNote that while the chain groups $C_n(X)$ depend on the choice of\nsimplicial approximation $K$, the resulting homology groups\n$$H_n(X) = \\frac{\\ker\\partial_n}{\\operatorname{im}\\,\\partial_{n+1}}$$ do\nnot.",
