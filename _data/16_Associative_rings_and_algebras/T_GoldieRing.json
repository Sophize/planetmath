  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. If the set of annihilators\n$\\{ \\operatorname{r.ann}(x) \\mid x \\in R\\}$ satisifies the ascending\nchain condition, then $R$ is said to satisfy the *ascending chain\ncondition on right annihilators*.\n\nA ring $R$ is called a *right Goldie ring* if it satisfies the ascending\nchain condition on right annihilators and $R_R$ is a module of finite\nrank.\n\n*Left Goldie ring* is defined similarly. If the context makes it clear\non which side the ring operates, then such a ring is simply called a\n*Goldie ring*.\n\nA right Noetherian ring is right Goldie.",
