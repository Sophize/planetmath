  "definition": "One can construct the polars of a polynomial by means of a differential\noperator. Suppose we have a homogeneous polynomial\n$p (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$. To compute the polars of $p$ we act on it with\nthe operator $\\Delta = y_1 \\, \\partial / \\partial x_1 + \\cdots \n+y_n \\, \\partial / \\partial x_n$; the $k$-th polar of $p$ equals\n$\\Delta^k p(x_1, \\ldots x_n)$.",
