We check that $(-1)\\cdot a$\nequals the additive inverse of $a$. $$\\begin{aligned}\na+(-1)\\cdot a &=& 1\\cdot a + (-1)\\cdot a, \\quad \\text{ by the definition of }1\\\\\n&=& (1+ (-1))\\cdot a, \\quad \\text{ by the distributive law}\\\\\n&=& 0\\cdot a,\\quad \\text{ by the definition of }-1\\\\\n&=& 0, \\quad \\text{ as a result of the properties of zero} \\end{aligned}$$\nHence $(-1)\\cdot a$ is \u201can\u201d additive inverse for $a$, and by uniqueness\n$(-1)\\cdot a = -a$, [*the*]{} additive inverse of $a$. Analogously, we\ncan prove that $a\\cdot (-1) = -a$ as well.",
