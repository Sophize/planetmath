  "definition": "An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is called a *large ideal* if for every ideal\n$J$ of $R$ such that $J\\neq\\{0\\}$, $I\\cap J \\neq\\{0\\}$\n\nA ring is semiprime iff every large ideal is dense.\n\nObviously all nontrivial ideal of an integral domain is a large ideal,\nand the maximal ideal of any non-trivial local ring is a large ideal.\n\n[99]{} **N.J.
