  "definition": "Let $X$ and $Q$ be modules. We say that $Q$ is an [*injective hull*]{}\nor [*injective envelope*]{} of $X$ if $Q$ is both an injective module\nand an essential extension of $X$.\n\nEquivalently, $Q$ is an injective hull of $X$ if $Q$ is injective, and\n$X$ is a submodule of $Q$, and if $g : X \\to Q'$ is a monomorphism from\n$X$ to an injective module $Q'$, then there exists a monomorphism\n$h : Q \\to Q'$ such that $h(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in X$. $$\\xymatrix{\n  &\n  0\n        \\ar[d]\n  \\\\\n  0\n        \\ar[r]\n  &\n  X\n        \\ar[r]^i\n        \\ar[d]_g\n  &\n  Q\n        \\ar@{-->}[dl]^h\n  \\\\\n  &\n  Q'\n}$$\n\nEvery module $X$ has an injective hull, which is unique up to\nisomorphism.
