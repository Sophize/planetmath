  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ be a left . The [*dual module*]{} of $M$ is\nthe right consisting of all module homomorphisms from $M$ into $R$.\n\nIt is denoted by $M^\\ast$. The elements of $M^\\ast$ are called [*linear\nfunctionals*]{}.\n\nThe action of $R$ on $M^\\ast$ is given by $(fr)(m) = (f(m))r$ for\n$f \\in M^\\ast$, $m \\in M$, and $r \\in R$.\n\nIf $R$ is commutative, then every $M$ is an with $rm = mr$ for all\n$r \\in R$ and $m \\in M$. Hence, it makes sense to ask whether $M$ and\n$M^\\ast$ are isomorphic. Suppose that $b: M \\times M \\to R$ is a\nbilinear form. Then it is easy to check that for a fixed $m \\in M$, the\nfunction $b(m, -): M \\to R$ is a module homomorphism, so is an element\nof $M^\\ast$. Then we have a module homomorphism from $M$ to $M^\\ast$\ngiven by $m \\mapsto b(m,-)$.",
