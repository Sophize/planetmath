  "statement": "If $R$ is a ring and $f\\colon M\\rightarrow N$ is a homomorphism of\n$R$-modules, then a right inverse of $f$ is a homomorphism\n$g\\colon N\\rightarrow M$ such that $f\\circ g$ is the identity map on\n$N$. For a right inverse to exist, it is clear that $f$ must be an\nepimorphism. If a right inverse exists for every such epimorphism and\nall modules $M$, then $N$ is said to be a projective module.\n\nFor fractional ideals over an integral domain $R$, the property of being\nprojective as an $R$-module is equivalent to being an invertible ideal.\n\nLet $R$ be an integral domain. Then a fractional ideal over $R$ is\ninvertible if and only if it is projective as an $R$-module.\n\nIn particular, every fractional ideal over a Dedekind domain is\ninvertible, and is therefore projective.",
