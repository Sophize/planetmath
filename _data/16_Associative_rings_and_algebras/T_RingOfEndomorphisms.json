  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring and let $M$ be a right $R$-module.\n\nAn *endomorphism* of $M$ is a $R$-module homomorphism from $M$ to\nitself. We shall write endomorphisms on the left, so that $f : M \\to M$\nmaps $x \\mapsto f(x)$. If $f,g : M \\to M$ are two endomorphisms, we can\nadd them: $$f+g : x \\mapsto f(x) + g(x)$$ and multiply them\n$$fg : x \\mapsto f(g(x))$$ With these operations, the set of\nendomorphisms of $M$ becomes a ring, which we call the *ring of\nendomorphisms of $M$*, written ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(M)$.\n\nInstead of writing endomorphisms as functions, it is often convenient to\nwrite them multiplicatively: we simply write the application of the\nendomorphism $f$ as $x \\mapsto fx$. Then the fact that each $f$ is an\n$R$-module homomorphism can be expressed as: $$f(xr) = (fx)r$$ for all\n$x \\in M$ and $r \\in R$ and $f \\in {\\operatorname{End}}_R(M)$. With this\nnotation, it is clear that $M$ becomes an\n${\\operatorname{End}}_R(M)$-$R$-bimodule.\n\nNow, let $N$ be a left $R$-module. We can construct the ring\n${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)$ in the same way. There is a complication,\nhowever, if we still think of endomorphism as functions written on the\nleft. In order to make $M$ into a bimodule, we need to define an action\nof ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)$ on the right of $N$: say\n$$x\\cdot f = f(x)$$ But then we have a problem with the multiplication:\n$$x \\cdot fg = fg(x) = f(g(x))$$ but\n$$(x \\cdot f) \\cdot g = f(x) \\cdot g = g(f(x))!$$ In order to make this\nwork, we need to reverse the order of composition when we define\nmultiplication in the ring ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)$ when it acts on\nthe right.\n\nThere are essentially two different ways to go from here. One is to\ndefine the multiplication in ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)$ the other way,\nwhich is most natural if we write the endomorphisms as functions on the\nright. This is the approach taken in many older books.\n\nThe other is to leave the multiplication in ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)$\nthe way it is, but to use the opposite ring to define the bimodule. This\nis the approach that is generally taken in more recent works. Using this\napproach, we conclude that $N$ is a\n$R$-${\\operatorname{End}}_R(N)^{\\text{op}}$-bimodule. We will adopt this\nconvention for the lemma below.\n\nConsidering $R$ as a right and a left module over itself, we can\nconstruct the two endomorphism rings ${\\operatorname{End}}_R(R_R)$ and\n${\\operatorname{End}}_R({}_RR)$.\n\nLet $R$ be a ring with an identity element. Then\n$R {\\cong}{\\operatorname{End}}_R(R_R)$ and\n$R {\\cong}{\\operatorname{End}}_R({}_RR)^{\\text{op}}$.\n\nDefine $\\rho_r \\in {\\operatorname{End}}_R({}_RR)$ by $x \\mapsto xr$.\n\nA calculation shows that $\\rho_{rs} = \\rho_s \\rho_r$ (functions written\non the left) from which it is easily seen that the map\n$\\theta : r \\mapsto \\rho_r$ is a ring homomorphism from $R$ to\n${\\operatorname{End}}_R({}_RR)^{\\text{op}}$.\n\nWe must show that this is an isomorphism.\n\nIf $\\rho_r = 0$, then $r = 1r = \\rho_r(1) = 0$. So $\\theta$ is\ninjective.\n\nLet $f$ be an arbitrary element of ${\\operatorname{End}}_R({}_RR)$, and\nlet $r = f(1)$. Then for any $x \\in R$,\n$f(x) = f(x1) = xf(1) = xr = \\rho_r(x)$, so $f = \\rho_r = \\theta(r)$.\n\nThe proof of the other isomorphism is similar.",
