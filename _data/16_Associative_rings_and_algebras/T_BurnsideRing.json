  "definition": "Let $G$ be a finite group. Recall that by $G$*-set* we understand a pair\n$(X,\\circ)$, where $X$ is a set and $\\circ:G\\times X\\rightarrow X$ is a\ngroup action of $G$ on $X$. For short notation the pair notation will be\nomitted and $G$-sets will be simply denoted by capital letters.\\\n\\\nRecall that for each subgroup $H\\subseteq G$ we have canonical $G$-set\n$G/H=\\{gH;\\ g\\in G\\}$ where group action is defined as follows: for any\n$g,k\\in G$ we have $(g,kH)\\longmapsto gkH$.\\\n\\\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be $G$-sets. Recall that by $G$*-map* from $X$ to $Y$ we\nunderstand any function $F:X\\rightarrow Y$ such that for any $g\\in G$\nand $x\\in X$ we have $F(gx)=gF(x)$.\\\n\\\nIt is easy to see that family of all $G$-sets and $G$-maps forms a\ncategory (with standard comoposition). We shall denote this category by\n$G-\\mathbb{S}$. Moreover, by $G-\\mathbb{S}_{0}$ we shall denote full\nsubcategory of $G-\\mathbb{S}$ whose objects are all finite $G$-sets.\\\n\\\nFrom $G$-sets $X$ and $Y$ one can construct another $G$-set in two\ninteresting (from our point of view) ways, i.e. by taking disjoint union\n$X\\sqcup Y$ with obvious group action and by taking product $X\\times Y$\nwith group action as follows: $(g,(x,y))\\longmapsto (gx,gy).$ Moreover\nit is clear that when $X$ and $Y$ are finite, so are $X\\sqcup Y$ and\n$X\\times Y$.\\\n\\\nConsider a finite $G$-set $X$. Then there exist a natural number\n$n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, finite family $\\{H_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ of subgroups of\n$G$ and an isomorphism (in $G-\\mathbb{S}_{0}$ category)\n$$X\\simeq\\coprod_{i=1}^{n} G/H_{i}.$$ Therefore (since $G$ is finite)\nfamily of isomorphism classes of $G-\\mathbb{S}_{0}$ forms a countable\nset.\\\n\\\nDenote by $\\Omega^{+}(G)=\\{[X];\\ X\\in G-\\mathbb{S}_{0}\\}$ the set of\nisomorphism classes of category $G-\\mathbb{S}_{0}$. Then one can turn\n$\\Omega^{+}(G)$ into a semiring as follows: for any finite $G$-sets $X$\nand $Y$ define $$[X]+[Y]=[X\\sqcup Y];$$ $$[X][Y]=[X\\times Y].$$ Note\nthat here we treat the empty set as a $G$-set (with one and unique group\naction), therefore $\\Omega^{+}(G)$ has zero element $[\\emptyset]$ (the\nother way is to formally add the zero to $\\Omega^{+}(G)$ - this is just\ntechnical thing).\\\n\\\nDefine by $\\Omega(G)=K(\\Omega^{+}(G))$ the Grothendieck group of\n$(\\Omega^{+}(G),+)$. If $A$ is an abelian semigroup and\n$f:A\\times A\\rightarrow A$ is a bilinear map, then it can be uniquely\nextended to a bilinear map $K(f):K(A)\\times K(A)\\rightarrow K(A)$,\ntherefore $\\Omega(G)$ can be uniquely turned into a ring from\n$\\Omega^{+}(G)$. This ring is called *the Burnside ring* of $G$.\\\n\\\nSome properties:\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(0)}$ each element of $\\Omega(G)$ can be expressed as a formal\ndiffrence $[X]-[Y]$;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(1)}$ $\\Omega(G)$ is a commutative, unital ring, where $[G/G]$\nis the unity of $\\Omega(G)$;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(2)}$ $\\Omega$ can be turned into a contravariant functor from\nthe category of finite groups to the category of commutative, unital\nrings;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(3)}$ $(\\Omega^{+}(G),+)$ is a cancellative semigroup,\ntherefore it embedds into $\\Omega(G)$;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(4)}$ for the trivial group $E$ there is a ring isomorphism\n$\\Omega(E)\\simeq\\mathbb{Z}$;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(5)}$ for any group $G$ there is a ring monomorphism\n$\\varphi:\\Omega(G)\\rightarrow\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbb{Z}$ for some\nnatural number $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$; this is called the characteristic\nembedding;\\\n\\\n$\\mathrm{(6)}$ for any two groups $G,H$ we have: if $\\Omega(G)$ and\n$\\Omega(H)$ are isomorphic (as a rings), then $|G|=|H|$; generally $G$\nneed not be isomorphic to $H$.",
