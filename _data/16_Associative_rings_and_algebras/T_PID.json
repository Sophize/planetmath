  "definition": "A *principal ideal domain* is an integral domain where every ideal is a\nprincipal ideal.\n\nIn a PID, an ideal $(p)$ is maximal if and only if $p$ is irreducible\n(and prime since ).\n\nNote that subrings of PIDs are not necessarily PIDs. (There is an\nexample of this within the entry biquadratic field.)",
