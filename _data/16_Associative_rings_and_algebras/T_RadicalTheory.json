  "definition": "Let ${\\mathcal{X}}$ represent a property which a ring may or may not\nhave. This property may be anything at all: what is important is that\nfor any ring $R$, the statement \u201c$R$ has property ${\\mathcal{X}}$\u201d is\neither true or false.\n\nWe say that a ring which has the property ${\\mathcal{X}}$ is an\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-ring. An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is called an\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-ideal if, as a ring, it is an ${\\mathcal{X}}$-ring.\n(Note that this definition only makes sense if rings are not required to\nhave identity elements; otherwise and ideal is not, in general, a ring.\nRings are not required to have an identity element in radical theory.)\n\nThe property ${\\mathcal{X}}$ is a *radical property* if it satisfies:\n\n1.  The class of ${\\mathcal{X}}$-rings is closed under homomorphic\n    images.\n\n2.  Every ring $R$ has a largest ${\\mathcal{X}}$-ideal, which contains\n    all other ${\\mathcal{X}}$-ideals of $R$. This ideal is written\n    ${\\mathcal{X}}(R)$.\n\n3.  ${\\mathcal{X}}(R/{\\mathcal{X}}(R)) = 0$.\n\nThe ideal ${\\mathcal{X}}(R)$ is called the *${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical* of\n$R$. A ring is called *${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical* if\n${\\mathcal{X}}(R) = R$, and is called *${\\mathcal{X}}$-semisimple* if\n${\\mathcal{X}}(R) = 0$.\n\nIf ${\\mathcal{X}}$ is a radical property, then the class of\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-rings is also called the class of\n*${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical rings*.\n\nThe class of ${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical rings is closed under ideal\nextensions. That is, if $A$ is an ideal of $R$, and $A$ and $R/A$ are\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical, then so is $R$.\n\n*Radical theory* is the study of radical properties and their\ninterrelations. There are several well-known radicals which are of\nindependent interest in ring theory (See examples \u2013 to follow).\n\nThe class of all radicals is however very large. Indeed, it is possible\nto show that any partition of the class of simple rings into two classes\n$\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$ such that isomorphic simple rings are in\nthe same class, gives rise to a radical ${\\mathcal{X}}$ with the\nproperty that all rings in $\\mathcal{R}$ are ${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical and\nall rings in $\\mathcal{S}$ are ${\\mathcal{X}}$-semisimple. In fact,\nthere are at least two distinct radicals for each such partition.\n\nA radical ${\\mathcal{X}}$ is *hereditary* if every ideal of an\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical ring is also ${\\mathcal{X}}$-radical.\n\nA radical ${\\mathcal{X}}$ is *supernilpotent* if the class of\n${\\mathcal{X}}$-rings contains all nilpotent rings.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nNil is a radical property. This property defines the nil radical,\n$\\mathcal{N}$.\n\nNilpotency is not a radical property.\n\nQuasi-regularity is a radical property. The associated radical is the\nJacobson radical, $\\mathcal{J}$.",
