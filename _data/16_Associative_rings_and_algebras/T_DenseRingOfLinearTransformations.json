  "definition": "Let $D$ be a division ring and $V$ a vector space over $D$. Let $R$ be a\nsubring of the ring of endomorphisms (linear transformations)\n$\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$ of $V$. Then $R$ is said to be a *dense ring\nof linear transformations* (over $D$) if we are given\n\n1.  any positive integer $n$,\n\n2.  any set $\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ of linearly independent\n    vectors in $V$, and\n\n3.  any set $\\lbrace w_i,\\ldots,w_n\\rbrace$ of arbitrary vectors in $V$,\n\nthen there exists an element $f\\in R$ such that\n$$f(v_i)=w_i\\quad\\mbox{ for }i=1,\\ldots,n.$$\n\nNote that the linear independence of the $v_i$\u2019s is essential in\ninsuring the existence of a linear transformation $f$. Otherwise,\nsuppose $0=\\sum d_iv_i$ where $d_1\\neq 0$. Pick $w_i$\u2019s so that they are\nlinearly independent. Then\n$0=f(\\sum d_iv_i)=\\sum d_if(v_i)=\\sum d_iw_i$, contradicting the linear\nindependence of the $w_i$\u2019s.\n\nThe notion of \u201cdense\u201d comes from topology: if $V$ is given the discrete\ntopology and $\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$ the compact-open topology, then\n$R$ is dense in $\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$ iff $R$ is a dense ring of\nlinear transformations of $V$.\n\nFirst, assume that $R$ is a dense ring of linear transformations of $V$.\nRecall that the compact-open topology on $\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$ has\nsubbasis of the form $B(K,U):=\\lbrace f\\mid f(K)\\subseteq U\\rbrace$,\nwhere $U$ is open and $K$ is compact in $V$. Since $V$ is discrete, $K$\nis finite. Now, pick a point $g\\in \\operatorname{End}_D(V)$ and let\n$$B=\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in I}\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n(\\alpha)}B(K_{i\\alpha},U_{i\\alpha})$$\nbe a neighborhood of $g$, $I$ some index set. Then for some\n$\\alpha\\in I$, $g\\in \\bigcap B(K_{i\\alpha},U_{i\\alpha})$. This means\nthat $g(K_{i\\alpha})\\subseteq U_{i\\alpha}$ for all\n$i=1,\\ldots,n(\\alpha)$. Since each $K_{i\\alpha}$ is finite, so is\n$K:=\\bigcup K_{i\\alpha}$. After some re-indexing, let\n$\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots, v_n\\rbrace$ be a maximal linearly independent\nsubset of $K$. Set $w_j=g(v_j)$, $j=1,\\ldots,n$. By assumption, there is\nan $f\\in R$ such that $f(v_j)=w_j$, for all $j$. For any $v\\in K$, $v$\nis a linear combination of the $v_j$\u2019s: $v=\\sum d_jv_j$, $d_j\\in D$.\nThen $f(v)=\\sum d_jf(v_j)=\\sum d_jg(_j)=g(v)\\in U_{i\\alpha}$ for some\n$i$. This shows that $f(K_{i\\alpha})\\subseteq U_{i\\alpha}$ and we have\n$f\\in \\bigcap B(K_{i\\alpha},U_{i\\alpha})\\subseteq B$.\n\nConversely, assume that the ring $R$ is a dense subset of the space\n$\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$. Let $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ be linearly independent,\nand $w_1,\\ldots,w_n$ be arbitrary vectors in $V$. Let $W$ be the\nsubspace spanned by the $v_i$\u2019s. Because the $v_i$\u2019s are linearly\nindependent, there exists a linear transformation $g$ such that\n$g(v_i)=w_i$ and $g(v)=0$ for $v\\notin W$. Let $K_i=\\lbrace v_i\\rbrace$\nand $U_i=\\lbrace w_i\\rbrace$. Then the $K_i$\u2019s are compact and the\n$U_i$\u2019s are open in the discrete space $V$. Clearly\n$g\\in\\lbrace h\\mid h(v_i)=w_i\\rbrace=B(K_i,U_i)$ for each\n$i=1,\\ldots,n$. So $g$ lies in the neighborhood\n$B=\\cap B(K_i,U_i)\\subseteq \\operatorname{End}_D(V)$. Since $R$ is dense\nin $\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$, there is an $f\\in R\\cap B$. This implies\nthat $f(v_i)=w_i$ for all $i$.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n-   If $V$ is finite dimensional over $D$, then any dense ring of linear\n    transformations $R=\\operatorname{End}_D(V)$. This can be easily\n    observed by using the second half of the proof above. Take a basis\n    $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ of $V$ and any set of $n$ vectors $w_1,\\ldots,w_n$\n    in $V$. Let $g$ be the linear transformation that maps $v_i$ to\n    $w_i$. The above proof shows that there is an $f\\in R$ such that $f$\n    agrees with $g$ on the basis elements. But then they must agree on\n    all of $V$ as a result, which is precisely the statement that\n    $g=f\\in R$.\n\n-   It can be shown that a ring $R$ is a primitive ring iff it is\n    isomorphic to a dense ring of linear transformations of a vector\n    space over a division ring. This is known as the **. It is a\n    generalization of the special case of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem\n    when the ring in question is a simple Artinian ring. In the general\n    case, the finite chain condition is dropped.",
