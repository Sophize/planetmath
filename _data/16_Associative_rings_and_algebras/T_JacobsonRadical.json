  "definition": "The [*Jacobson radical*]{} $J(R)$ of a unital ring $R$ is the\nintersection of the annihilators of left $R$-modules.\n\nThe following are alternative characterizations of the Jacobson radical\n$J(R)$:\n\n1.  The intersection of all left primitive ideals.\n\n2.  The intersection of all maximal left ideals.\n\n3.  The set of all $t \\in R$ such that for all $r \\in R$, $1-rt$ is left\n    invertible (i.e. there exists $u$ such that $u(1-rt)=1$).\n\n4.  The largest ideal $I$ such that for all $v \\in I$, $1-v$ is a unit\n    in $R$.\n\n5.  \\(1) - (3) with \u201cleft\u201d replaced by \u201cright\u201d and $rt$ replaced by $tr$.\n\nIf $R$ is commutative and finitely generated, then\n$$J(R)=\\{x \\in R \\mid x^n=0 \\hbox{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}\n   = \\operatorname{Nil}(R).$$\n\nThe Jacobson radical can also be defined for non-unital rings. To do\nthis, we first define a binary operation $\\circ$ on the ring $R$ by\n$x\\circ y=x+y-xy$ for all $x,y\\in R$. Then $(R,\\circ)$ is a monoid, and\nthe Jacobson radical is defined to be the largest ideal $I$ of $R$ such\nthat $(I,\\circ)$ is a group. If $R$ is unital, this is equivalent to the\ndefinitions given earlier.",
