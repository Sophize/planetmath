  "statement": "Let $R$ be a ring with an identity. Then $R$ has a right classical ring\nof quotients $Q$ which is semisimple Artinian if and only if $R$ is a\nsemiprime right Goldie ring. If this is the case, then the composition\nlength of $Q$ is equal to the uniform dimension of $R$.\n\nAn immediate corollary of this is that a semiprime right Noetherian ring\nalways has a right classical ring of quotients.\n\nThis result was discovered by Alfred in the late 1950\u2019s.",
