  "definition": "A ring $R$ is said to be a [*reduced ring*]{} if $R$ contains no\nnon-zero nilpotent elements. In other words, $r^2=0$ implies $r=0$ for\nany $r\\in R$.\n\nBelow are some examples of reduced rings.\n\n-   A reduced ring is semiprime.\n\n-   A ring is a iff it is and reduced.\n\n-   A commutative semiprime ring is reduced. In particular, all integral\n    domains and Boolean rings are reduced.\n\n-   Assume that $R$ is commutative, and let $A$ be the set of all\n    nilpotent elements. Then $A$ is an ideal of $R$, and that $R/A$ is\n    reduced (for if $(r+A)^2=0$, then $r^2\\in A$, so $r^2$, and\n    consequently $r$, is nilpotent, or $r\\in A$).\n\nAn example of a reduced ring with zero-divisors is $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, with\nmultiplication defined componentwise:\n$(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)(b_1,\\ldots,b_n):=(a_1b_1,\\ldots, a_nb_n)$. A ring of\nfunctions taking values in a reduced ring is also reduced.\n\nSome prototypical examples of rings that are not reduced are\n$\\mathbb{Z}_8$, since $4^2=0$, as well as any matrix ring over any ring;\nas illustrated by the instance below\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$",
