  "definition": "A module $X$ over a ring $R$ is said to be [*finitely generated*]{} if\nthere is a finite subset $Y$ of $X$ such that $Y$ spans $X$. Let us\nrecall that the span of a (not necessarily finite) set $X$ of vectors is\nthe class of all (finite) linear combinations of elements of $S$;\nmoreover, let us recall that the span of the empty set is defined to be\nthe singleton consisting of only one vector, the zero vector $\\vec{0}$.\nA module $X$ is then called *cyclic* if it can be a singleton.\n\n**Examples**. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1 and $x$ be an\nindeterminate.\n\n1.  $Rx=\\lbrace rx \\mid r\\in R \\rbrace$ is a cyclic $R$-module generated\n    by $\\lbrace x \\rbrace$.\n\n2.  $R\\oplus Rx$ is a finitely-generated $R$-module generated by\n    $\\lbrace 1, x \\rbrace$. Any element in $R\\oplus Rx$ can be expressed\n    uniquely as $r+sx$.\n\n3.  $R[x]$ is not finitely generated as an $R$-module. For if there is a\n    finite set $Y$ $R[x]$, taking $d$ to be the largest of all degrees\n    of polynomials in $Y$, then $x^{d+1}$ would not be in the of $Y$,\n    assumed to be $R[x]$, which is a contradiction. (Note, however, that\n    $R[x]$ is finitely-generated as an $R$-algebra.)",
