  "definition": "Let $K$ be a unital ring and $A$ a $K$-algebra. Defining \u201cdivision\u201d\nrequires special considerations when the algebras are non-associative so\nwe introduce the definition in stages.\n\nAssociative division algebras\n=============================\n\nIf $A$ is an associative algebra then we say $A$ is a *division algebra*\nif\n\n(i) $A$ is unital with identity $1$. So for all $a\\in A$, $$a1=1a=a.$$\n\n(ii) Also every non-zero element of $A$ has an inverse. That is\n    $a\\in A$, $a\\neq 0$, then there exists a $b\\in A$ such that\n    $$ab=1=ba.$$ We denote $b$ by $a^{-1}$ and we may prove $a^{-1}$ is\n    unique to $a$.\n\nThe standard examples of associative division algebras are fields, which\nare commutative, and the non-split quaternion algebra:\n$\\alpha,\\beta\\in K$, $$\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta}{K}\\right)=\\left\\{\na_1 1+a_2 i+a_3 j+a_4 k : i^2=\\alpha 1, j^2=\\beta 1, k^2=-\\alpha \\beta 1, ij=k=-ji.\\right\\}$$\nwhere $x^2-\\alpha$ and $x^2-\\beta$ are irreducible over $K$.\n\nNon-associative division algebras\n=================================\n\nFor non-associative algebras $A$, the notion of an inverse is not\nimmediate. We use $x.y$ for the product of $x,y\\in A$.\n\n**Invertible as endomorphisms:** Let $a\\in A$. Then define\n$L_a:x\\mapsto a.x$ and $R_a:x\\mapsto x.a$. As the product of $A$ is\ndistributive, both $L_a$ an $R_a$ are additive endomorphisms of $A$. If\n$L_a$ is invertible then we may call $a$ \u201cleft invertible\u201d and\nsimilarly, when $R_a$ is invertible we may call $a$ \u201cright invertible\u201d\nand \u201cinvertible\u201d if both $L_a$ and $R_a$ are invertible.\n\nIn this model of invertible, $A$ is a *division algebra* if, and only\nif, for each non-zero $a\\in A$, both $L_a$ and $R_a$ invertible.\nEquivalently: the equations $a.x=b$ and $y.a=b$ have unique solutions\nfor nonzero $a,b\\in A$. However, $x$ and $y$ need not be equal.\n\nA common method to produce non-associative division algebras of this\nsort is through Schur\u2019s Lemma.\n\n**Invertible in the product:** In some instances, the notion of\ninvertible via endomorphisms is not sufficient. Instead, assume $A$ has\nan identity, that is, an element $1\\in A$ such that for all $a\\in A$,\n$$1.a=a=a.1.$$\n\nNext if $a\\in A$, we say $a$ is *invertible* if there exists a $b\\in A$\nsuch that $$\\label{eq:inv}\na.b=1=b.a$$ and furthermore that for all $x\\in A$,\n$$\\label{eq:inv-non-a}\nb.(a.x)=x=(x.a).b.$$ Evidently (\\[eq:inv\\]) can be inferred from\n(\\[eq:inv-non-a\\]). This added assumption substitutes for the need of\nassociativity in the proofs of uniqueness of inverses and in solving\nequations with non-associative products.\n\nIf $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra over a field, then invertible in\nthis sense forces both $L_a$ and $R_a$ to be invertible as well.\n\nLet $x\\in A$. Then $xL_1=1.x=x=b.(a.x)=x L_a L_b$. So $L_1=L_a L_b$. As\n$L_1$ is the identity map, $L_a$ is injective and $L_b$ is surjective.\nAs $A$ is finite dimensional, injective and surjective endomorphisms are\nbijective.\n\nIn this model, a non-associative algebra is a division algebra $A$ if it\nis unital and every non-zero element is invertible.\n\nAlternative division algebras\n=============================\n\nThe standard examples of non-associative division algebras are actually\nalternative alegbras, specfically, the composition algebras of fields,\nnon-split quaternions and non-split octonions \u2013 only the latter are\nactually not associative. Invertible in the octonions is interpreted in\nthe second stronger form.\n\nEvery alternative division algebra is either associative or a non-split\noctonion.\n\nThis result is usually followed by two useful results which serve to\nomit the need to consider non-associative examples.\n\nA finite alternative division algebra is associative and commutative, so\nit is a finite field.\n\nAn alternative division algebra over an algebraically closed field is\nthe field itself.",
