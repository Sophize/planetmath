  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring, and let $A$ and $B$ be left (right) ideals of $R$.\nThen the [*product*]{} of the ideals $A$ and $B$, which we denote $AB$,\nis the left (right) ideal generated by all products $ab$ with $a\\in A$\nand $b\\in B$. Note that since sums of products of the form $ab$ with\n$a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$ are contained simultaneously in both $A$ and $B$,\nwe have $AB\\subset A\\cap B$.",
