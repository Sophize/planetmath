  "definition": "Let $X$ be a subset of a ring $R$. Let $S=\\{I_k\\}$ be the collection of\nall left ideals of $R$ that contain $X$ (note that the set is nonempty\nsince $X\\subset R$ and $R$ is an ideal in itself). The intersection\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nI=\\bigcap_{I_k\\in S} I_k\\end{aligned}$$ is called the *left ideal\ngenerated by $X$*, and is denoted by $(X)$. We say that $X$ *generates*\n$I$ as an ideal.\n\nThe definition is symmetrical for right ideals.\n\nAlternatively, we can constructively form the set of elements that\nconstitutes this ideal: The left ideal $(X)$ consists of finite\n$R$-linear combinations of elements of $X$: $$\\begin{aligned}\n(X)=\\left\\{\\sum_\\lambda (r_\\lambda a_\\lambda + n_\\lambda a_\\lambda)\\mid a_\\lambda\\in X, r_\\lambda\\in R, n_\\lambda\\in{{\\mathbb}{Z}}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}$$",
