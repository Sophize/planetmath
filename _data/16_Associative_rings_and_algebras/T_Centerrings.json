  "definition": "If $A$ is a ring, the center of $A$, sometimes denoted\n$\\operatorname{Z}(A)$, is the set of all elements in $A$ that commute\nwith all other elements of $A$. That is,\n$$\\operatorname{Z}(A) = \\{ a \\in A \\mid ax = xa \\text{} \\forall x \\in A \\}$$\n\nNote that $0 \\in \\operatorname{Z}(A)$ so the center is non-empty. If we\nassume that $A$ is a ring with a multiplicative unity $1$, then $1$ is\nin the center as well. The center of $A$ is also a subring of $A$.",
