Then $J(R/J(R))=(0)$.\n\n[*Proof:*]{}\\\nWe will only prove this in the case where $R$ is a unital ring (although\nit is true without this assumption).\n\nLet $[u] \\in J(R/J(R))$. By one of the characterizations of the Jacobson\nradical, $1-[r][u]$ is left invertible for all $r \\in R$, so there\nexists $v \\in R$ such that $[v](1-[r][u])=1$.\n\nThen $v(1-ru)=1-a$ for some $a \\in J(R)$. There is a $w \\in R$ such that\n$w(1-a)=1$, and we have $wv(1-ru)=1$.\n\nSince this holds for all $r \\in R$, it follows that $u \\in J(R)$, and\ntherefore $[u]=0$.",
