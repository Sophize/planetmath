  "definition": "### General Definition of a Ring with Involution {#general-definition-of-a-ring-with-involution .unnumbered}\n\nLet $R$ be a ring. An ** $*$ on $R$ is an anti-endomorphism whose square\nis the identity map. In other words, for $a,b\\in R$:\n\n1.  $(a+b)^*=a^*+b^*$,\n\n2.  $(ab)^*=b^*a^*$,\n\n3.  $a^{**}=a$\n\nA ring admitting an involution is called an *involutory ring*. $a^*$ is\ncalled the *adjoint* of $a$. By (3), $a$ is the adjoint of $a^*$, so\nthat every element of $R$ is an adjoint.\n\n**Remark**. Note that the traditional definition of an on a vector space\nis different from the one given here. Clearly, $*$ is bijective, so that\nit is an anti-automorphism. If $*$ is the identity on $R$, then $R$ is\ncommutative.\n\n**Examples**. Involutory rings occur most often in rings of\nendomorphisms over a module. When $V$ is a finite dimensional vector\nspace over a field $k$ with a given basis $\\boldsymbol{b}$, any linear\ntransformation over $T$ (to itself) can be represented by a square\nmatrix $M$ over $k$ via $\\boldsymbol{b}$. The map taking $M$ to its\ntranspose $M^T$ is an involution. If $k$ is $\\mathbb{C}$, then the map\ntaking $M$ to its conjugate transpose $\\overline{M}^T$ is also an\ninvolution. In general, the composition of an isomorphism and an\ninvolution is an involution, and the composition of two involutions is\nan isomorphism.\n\n### \\*-Homomorphisms {#homomorphisms .unnumbered}\n\nLet $R$ and $S$ be involutory rings with involutions $*_R$ and $*_S$. A\n*\\*-homomorphism* $\\phi:R\\to S$ is a ring homomorphism which respects\ninvolutions. More precisely,\n\n$$\\phi(a^{*_R})=\\phi(a)^{*_S},\\quad\\mbox{ for any }a\\in R.$$\n\nBy abuse of notation, if we use $*$ to denote both $*_R$ and $*_S$, then\nwe see that any \\*-homomorphism $\\phi$ commutes with $*$: $\\phi*=*\\phi$.\n\n### Special Elements {#special-elements .unnumbered}\n\nAn element $a\\in R$ such that $a=a^*$ is called a *self-adjoint*. A ring\nwith involution is usually associated with a ring of square matrices\nover a field, as such, a self-adjoint element is sometimes called a\n*Hermitian element*, or a *symmetric element*. For example, for any\nelement $a\\in R$,\n\n1.  $aa^*$ and $a^*a$ are both self-adjoint, the first of which is\n    called the *norm* of $a$. A *norm element* $b$ is simply an element\n    expressible in the form $aa^*$ for some $a\\in R$, and we write\n    $b=\\operatorname{n}(a)$. If $aa^*=a^*a$, then $a$ is called a\n    *normal element*. If $a^*$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$,\n    then $a$ is a *unitary element*. If $a$ is unitary, then it is\n    normal.\n\n2.  With respect to addition, we can also form self-adjoint elements\n    $a+a^*=a^*+a$, called the *trace* of $a$, for any $a\\in R$. A *trace\n    element* $b$ is an element expressible as $a+a^*$ for some $a\\in R$,\n    and written $b=\\operatorname{tr}(a)$.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of $R$, write $S^*:=\\lbrace a^*\\mid a\\in S\\rbrace$.\nThen $S$ is said to be *self-adjoint* if $S=S^*$.\n\nA self-adjoint that is also an idempotent in $R$ is called a\n*projection*. If $e$ and $f$ are two projections in $R$ such that\n$eR=fR$ (principal ideals generated by $e$ and $f$ are equal), then\n$e=f$. For if $ea=ff=f$ for some $a\\in R$, then $f=ea=eea=ef$.\nSimilarly, $e=fe$. Therefore, $e=e^*=(fe)^*=e^*f^*=ef=f$.\n\nIf the characteristic of $R$ is not 2, we also have a companion concept\nto self-adjointness, that of skew symmetry. An element $a$ in $R$ is\nskew symmetric if $a=-a^*$. Again, the name of this is borrowed from\nlinear algebra.",
