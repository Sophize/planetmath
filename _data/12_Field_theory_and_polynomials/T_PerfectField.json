  "definition": "A *perfect field* is a field $K$ such that every algebraic extension\nfield $L/K$ is separable over $K$.\n\nAll fields of characteristic 0 are perfect, so in particular the fields\n$\\mathbb R$, $\\mathbb C$ and $\\mathbb Q$ are perfect. If $K$ is a field\nof characteristic $p$ (with $p$ a prime number), then $K$ is perfect if\nand only if the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on $K$, defined by\n$$F(x)=x^p\\quad(x\\in K),$$ is an automorphism of $K$. Since the\nFrobenius map is always injective, it is sufficient to check whether $F$\nis surjective. In particular, all finite fields are perfect (any\ninjective endomorphism is also surjective). Moreover, any field whose\ncharacteristic is nonzero that is over its prime subfield is perfect.\nThus, the only fields that are not perfect are those whose\ncharacteristic is nonzero and are transcendental over their prime\nsubfield.\n\nSimilarly, a ring $R$ of characteristic $p$ is perfect if the\nendomorphism $x\\mapsto x^p$ of $R$ is an [*automorphism*]{} (i.e., is\nsurjective).",
