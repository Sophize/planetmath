  "definition": "A field $K$ is called *separably algebraically closed* if every\nseparable element of the algebraic closure of $K$ belongs to $K$. In the\ncase when $K$ has characteristic 0, it is separably algebraically closed\nif and only if it is algebraically closed.If $K$ has positive\ncharacteristic $p$, $K$ is separably algebraically closed if and only if\nits algebraic closure is a purely inseparable extension of $K$.",
