  "definition": "Let $F$ and $K$ be fields.\n\nA [*field homomorphism*]{} is a function $\\psi\\colon F \\to K$ such that:\n\n1.  $\\psi(a+b) = \\psi(a)+\\psi(b)$ for all $a,b \\in F$\n\n2.  $\\psi(a\\cdot b) = \\psi(a) \\cdot \\psi(b)$ for all $a,b \\in F$\n\n3.  $\\psi(1)=1,\\quad \\psi(0)=0$\n\nIf $\\psi$ is injective and surjective, then we say that $\\psi$ is a\n*field isomorphism*.\n\nLet $\\psi\\colon F\\to K$ be a field homomorphism. Then $\\psi$ is\ninjective.\n\nIndeed, if $\\psi$ is a field homomorphism, in particular it is a ring\nhomomorphism. Note that the kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal\nand a field $F$ only has two ideals, namely $\\{0\\}, F$. Moreover, by the\ndefinition of field homomorphism, $\\psi(1)=1$, hence $1$ is not in the\nkernel of the map, so the kernel must be equal to $\\{0\\}$.\n\n[**Remark**]{}: For this reason the terms \u201cfield homomorphism\u201d and\n\u201cfield monomorphism\u201d are synonymous. Also note that if $\\psi$ is a field\nmonomorphism, then $$\\psi(F)\\cong F, \\quad \\psi(F)\\subseteq K$$ so there\nis a \u201ccopy\u201d of $F$ in $K$. In other words, if $$\\psi\\colon F\\to K$$ is a\nfield homomorphism then there exist a subfield $H$ of $K$ such that\n$H\\cong F$. Conversely, suppose there exists $H\\subset K$ with $H$\nisomorphic to $F$. Then there is an isomorphism $$\\chi \\colon F \\to H$$\nand we also have the inclusion homomorphism\n$$\\iota\\colon H \\hookrightarrow K$$ Thus the composition\n$$\\iota \\circ \\chi\\colon F \\to K$$ is a field homomorphism.\n\n[**Remark**]{}: Let $\\psi : F \\to K$ be a field homomorphism. We claim\nthat the characteristic of $F$ and $K$ must be the same. Indeed, since\n$\\psi(1_F)=1_K$ and $\\psi(0_F)=0_K$ then $\\psi(n\\cdot 1_F)=n\\cdot 1_K$\nfor all natural numbers $n$. If the characteristic of $F$ is $p>0$ then\n$0=\\psi(p\\cdot 1)=p\\cdot 1$ in $K$, and so the characteristic of $K$ is\nalso $p$. If the characteristic of $F$ is $0$, then the characteristic\nof $K$ must be $0$ as well. For if $p\\cdot 1=0$ in $K$ then\n$\\psi(p\\cdot 1)=0$, and since $\\psi$ is injective by the lemma, we would\nhave $p\\cdot 1=0$ in $F$ as well.",
