  "definition": "A polynomial $P(x_1, \\cdots, x_n)$ of degree $k$ is called homogeneous\nif $P(cx_1, \\cdots, cx_n) = c^{k}P(x_1, \\cdots, x_n)$ for all constants\n$c$.\n\nAn equivalent definition is that all terms of the polynomial have the\nsame degree (i.e. $k$).\n\nObserve that a polynomial $P$ is homogeneous iff\n$\\deg P = \\operatorname{ord}P$.\n\nAs an important example of homogeneous polynomials one can mention the\nsymmetric polynomials.",
