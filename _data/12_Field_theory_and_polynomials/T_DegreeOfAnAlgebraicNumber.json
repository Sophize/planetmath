  "definition": "Let $\\alpha$ be an algebraic number. The *degree* of $\\alpha$ is the of\nthe minimal polynomial for $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nIn a manner to polynomials, the degree of $\\alpha$ may be denoted\n$\\deg\\alpha$.\n\nFor example, since $x^3-2$ is the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt[3]{2}$\nover $\\mathbb{Q}$, we have $\\deg\\sqrt[3]{2}=3$.",
