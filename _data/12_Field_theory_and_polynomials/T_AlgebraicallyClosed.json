  "definition": "A field $K$ is *algebraically closed* if every non-constant polynomial\nin $K[X]$ has a root in $K$.\n\nAn extension field $L$ of $K$ is an *algebraic closure* of $K$ if $L$ is\nalgebraically closed and every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$.\nUsing the axiom of choice, one can show that any field has an algebraic\nclosure. Moreover, any two algebraic closures of a field are isomorphic\nas fields, but not necessarily canonically isomorphic.",
