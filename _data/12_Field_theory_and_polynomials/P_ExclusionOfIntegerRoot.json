This $x_0$ cannot be even, because else all terms of\n$p(x_0)$ except $a_0$ were even and thus the whole sum could not have\nthe even value 0. Consequently, $x_0$ and also its have to be odd. Since\n$$2 \\mid 0 = p(x_0) \\quad \\textrm{and} \\quad 2 \\nmid p(0) = a_0,$$ there\nmust be among the coefficients $a_n,\\,a_{n-1},\\,\\ldots,\\,a_1$ an odd\namount of odd numbers. This means that\n$$2 \\mid a_n\\!+\\!a_{n-1}\\!+\\!\\ldots\\!+\\!a_1\\!+\\!a_0 \\;=\\; p(1).$$ This\nhowever contradicts the assumption on the parity of $p(1)$, whence the\nantithesis is wrong and the theorem .",
