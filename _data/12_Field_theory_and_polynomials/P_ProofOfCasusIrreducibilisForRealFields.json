  "statement": "The classical statement of the *casus irreducibilis* is that if $f(x)$\nis an irreducible cubic polynomial with rational coefficients and three\nreal roots, then the roots of $f(x)$ are not expressible using real\nradicals. One example of such a polynomial is $x^3-3x+1$, whose roots\nare $2\\cos(2\\pi/9), 2\\cos(8\\pi/9), 2\\cos(14\\pi/9)$.\n\nThis article generalizes the classical case to include all polynomials\nwhose degree is not a power of $2$, and also generalizes the base field\nto be any real extension of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$:\n\nLet $F\\subset {\\mathbb{R}}$ be a field, and assume $f(x)\\in F[x]$ is an\nirreducible polynomial whose splitting field $L$ is real with\n$F\\subset L\\subset {\\mathbb{R}}$. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  Some root of $f(x)$ is expressible by real radicals over $F$;\n\n2.  All roots of $f(x)$ are expressible by real radicals over $F$ using\n    only square roots;\n\n3.  $F\\subset L$ is a radical extension;\n\n4.  $[L:F]$ is a power of $2$.\n\n**Proof.** That $(2)\\Rightarrow (1)$ is obvious, and\n$(3)\\Rightarrow (1)$ since $F\\subset L$ is radical, and is real since\n$L\\subset {\\mathbb{R}}$. $(4)$ implies that $G=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)$\nhas order a power of $2$. Since $G$ is a $2$-group, it has a nontrivial\ncenter (this follows directly from the class equation, or look ) and\nthus has a normal subgroup $H$ of order $2$, which corresponds to a\nsubfield $M$ of $L$ Galois over $F$ with $[L:M]=2$. But then\n$\\operatorname{Gal}(M/F)$ is also a $2$-group, so inductively we see\nthat we can write\n$$F=K_0\\subset K_1\\subset \\ldots \\subset K_{m-1}=M \\subset K_m=L$$ where\n$[K_i:K_{i-1}]=2$. Thus each $K_i$ is obtained from $K_{i-1}$ by\nadjoining a square root; it must be a real square root since\n$L\\subset {\\mathbb{R}}$. This shows that $(4)\\Rightarrow (2)$ and $(3)$.\n\nThe meat of the proof is in showing that $(1)\\Rightarrow (4)$. Let the\nroots of $f(x)$ be $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_m$, and assume, by\nrenumbering if necessary, that $\\alpha=\\alpha_1$ lies in a real radical\nextension $K$ of $F$ but that $[L:F]$ is not a power of $2$. Choose an\nodd prime $p$ dividing $[L:F]=\\lvert G\\rvert$, and choose an element\n$\\tau\\in G$ of order $p$. Then $\\tau$ is not the identity, so for some\n$i$, $\\tau(\\alpha_i)\\neq \\alpha_i$. Also, since $f(x)$ is irreducible,\n$G$ acts transitively on the roots of $f(x)$, so for some $\\nu\\in G$,\n$\\nu(\\alpha)=\\alpha_i$. Then $\\sigma=\\nu^{-1}\\tau\\nu$ does not fix\n$\\alpha$, since\n$$\\nu^{-1}\\tau\\nu(\\alpha)=\\nu^{-1}\\tau(\\alpha_i)\\neq \\nu^{-1}(\\alpha_i)=\\alpha$$\nLet $N=L^{\\sigma}$ be the fixed field of $\\sigma$. Then $L$ is Galois\nover $N$, and clearly $[L:N]=p$. But Galois subfields of real radical\nextensions are at most quadratic, so $L$ cannot lie in a real radical\nextension of $N$.\n\nHowever, $\\alpha\\notin N, \\alpha\\in L$, and $[L:N]$ is prime. Thus\n$L=N(\\alpha)\\subset NK$ (since $\\alpha\\in K$). Additionally, since\n$F\\subset F(\\alpha)\\subset K$ is a real radical extension of $F$, we\nhave also that $NK$ is a real radical extension of $NF=N$. So $L$ lies\nin the real radical extension $NK$ of $N$. But this is a contradiction\nand thus $[L:F]$ must be a power of $2$.\n\nOne consequence of this theorem is the fact that if $f(x)\\in F[x]$ has\ndegree not a power of $2$, then if $f(x)$ has all real roots, those\nroots are not expressible in terms of real radicals. If $\\deg f=3$, we\nrecover the original *casus irreducibilis*.\n\n[10]{} D.A.\u00a0Cox, *Galois Theory*, Wiley-Interscience, 2004.",
