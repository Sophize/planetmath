  "definition": "A *finite field* (also called a *Galois field*) is a field that has\nfinitely many elements. The number of elements in a finite field is\nsometimes called the *order* of the field. We will present some basic\nfacts about finite fields.\n\nSize of a finite field\n======================\n\nA finite field $F$ has positive characteristic $p > 0$ for some prime\n$p$. The cardinality of $F$ is $p^n$ where $n := [F:{\\mathbb{F}}_p]$ and\n${\\mathbb{F}}_p$ denotes the prime subfield of $F$.\n\nThe characteristic of $F$ is positive because otherwise the additive\nsubgroup generated by $1$ would be an infinite subset of $F$.\nAccordingly, the prime subfield ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$ of $F$ is isomorphic to\nthe field ${\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$ of integers mod $p$. The integer\n$p$ is prime since otherwise ${\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$ would have\nzero divisors. Since the field $F$ is an $n$\u2013dimensional vector space\nover ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$ for some finite $n$, it is set\u2013isomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{F}}_p^n$ and thus has cardinality $p^n$.\n\nExistence of finite fields\n==========================\n\nNow that we know every finite field has $p^n$ elements, it is natural to\nask which of these actually arise as cardinalities of finite fields. It\nturns out that for each prime $p$ and each natural number $n$, there is\nessentially exactly one finite field of size $p^n$.\n\n\\[fermat\\] In any field $F$ with $m$ elements, the equation $x^m = x$ is\nsatisfied by all elements $x$ of $F$.\n\nThe result is clearly true if $x = 0$. We may therefore assume $x$ is\nnot zero. By definition of field, the set $F^\\times$ of nonzero elements\nof $F$ forms a group under multiplication. This set has $m-1$ elements,\nand by Lagrange\u2019s theorem $x^{m-1} = 1$ for any $x \\in F^\\times$, so\n$x^m = x$ follows.\n\n\\[existence\\] For each prime $p > 0$ and each natural number\n$n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}$, there exists a finite field of cardinality $p^n$,\nand any two such are isomorphic.\n\nFor $n=1$, the finite field\n${\\mathbb{F}}_p := {\\mathbb{Z}}/p{\\mathbb{Z}}$ has $p$ elements, and any\ntwo such are isomorphic by the map sending $1$ to $1$.\n\nIn general, the polynomial $f(X) := X^{p^n} - X \\in {\\mathbb{F}}_p[X]$\nhas derivative $-1$ and thus is separable over ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$. We\nclaim that the splitting field $F$ of this polynomial is a finite field\nof size $p^n$. The field $F$ certainly contains the set $S$ of roots of\n$f(X)$. However, the set $S$ is closed under the field operations, so\n$S$ is itself a field. Since splitting fields are minimal by definition,\nthe containment $S \\subset F$ means that $S = F$. Finally, $S$ has $p^n$\nelements since $f(X)$ is separable, so $F$ is a field of size $p^n$.\n\nFor the uniqueness part, any other field $F'$ of size $p^n$ contains a\nsubfield isomorphic to ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$. Moreover, $F'$ equals the\nsplitting field of the polynomial $X^{p^n} - X$ over ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$,\nsince by Lemma\u00a0\\[fermat\\] every element of $F'$ is a root of this\npolynomial, and all $p^n$ possible roots of the polynomial are accounted\nfor in this way. By the uniqueness of splitting fields up to\nisomorphism, the two fields $F$ and $F'$ are isomorphic.\n\nNote: The proof of Theorem\u00a0\\[existence\\] given here, while standard\nbecause of its efficiency, relies on more abstract algebra than is\nstrictly necessary. The reader may find a more concrete presentation of\nthis and many other results about finite fields in\u00a0[@ir Ch. 7].\n\n\\[normal\\] Every finite field $F$ is a normal extension of its prime\nsubfield ${\\mathbb{F}}_p$.\n\nThis follows from the fact that field extensions obtained from splitting\nfields are normal extensions.\n\nUnits in a finite field\n=======================\n\nHenceforth, in light of Theorem\u00a0\\[existence\\], we will write\n${\\mathbb{F}}_q$ for the unique (up to isomorphism) finite field of\ncardinality $q =\np^n$. A fundamental step in the investigation of finite fields is the\nobservation that their multiplicative groups are cyclic:\n\n\\[cyclic\\] The multiplicative group ${\\mathbb{F}}_q^*$ consisting of\nnonzero elements of the finite field ${\\mathbb{F}}_q$ is a cyclic group.\n\nWe begin with the formula $$\\label{sum}\n\\sum_{d {\\mid}k} \\phi(d) = k,$$ where $\\phi$ denotes the Euler totient\nfunction. It is proved as follows. For every divisor $d$ of $k$, the\ncyclic group $C_k$ of size $k$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup $C_d$ of\nsize $d$. Let $G_d$ be the subset of $C_d$ consisting of elements of\n$C_d$ which have the maximum possible of $d$. Since every element of\n$C_k$ has maximal order in the subgroup of $C_k$ that it generates, we\nsee that the sets $G_d$ partition the set $C_k$, so that\n$$\\sum_{d {\\mid}k} |G_d| = |C_k| = k.$$ The identity\u00a0 then follows from\nthe observation that the cyclic subgroup $C_d$ has exactly $\\phi(d)$\nelements of maximal order $d$.\n\nWe now prove the theorem. Let $k = q-1$, and for each divisor $d$ of\n$k$, let $\\psi(d)$ be the number of elements of ${\\mathbb{F}}_q^*$ of\norder $d$. We claim that $\\psi(d)$ is either zero or $\\phi(d)$. Indeed,\nif it is nonzero, then let $x \\in {\\mathbb{F}}_q^*$ be an element of\norder $d$, and let $G_x$ be the subgroup of ${\\mathbb{F}}_q^*$ generated\nby $x$. Then $G_x$ has size $d$ and every element of $G_x$ is a root of\nthe polynomial $x^d -\n1$. But this polynomial cannot have more than $d$ roots in a field, so\nevery root of $x^d - 1$ must be an element of $G_x$. In particular,\nevery element of order $d$ must be in $G_x$ already, and we see that\n$G_x$ only has $\\phi(d)$ elements of order $d$.\n\nWe have proved that $\\psi(d) \\leq \\phi(d)$ for all $d {\\mid}q-1$. If\n$\\psi(q-1)$ were 0, then we would have\n$$\\sum_{d {\\mid}q-1} \\psi(d) < \\sum_{d {\\mid}q-1} \\phi(d) = q-1,$$ which\nis impossible since the first sum must equal $q-1$ (because every\nelement of ${\\mathbb{F}}_q^*$ has order equal to some divisor $d$ of\n$q-1$).\n\nA more constructive proof of Theorem\u00a0\\[cyclic\\], which actually exhibits\na generator for the cyclic group, may be found in\u00a0[@stewart Ch. 16].\n\nEvery extension of finite fields is a primitive extension.\n\nBy Theorem\u00a0\\[cyclic\\], the multiplicative group of the extension field\nis cyclic. Any generator of the multiplicative group of the extension\nfield also algebraically generates the extension field over the base\nfield.\n\nAutomorphisms of a finite field\n===============================\n\nObserve that, since a splitting field for $X^{q^m} - X$ over\n${\\mathbb{F}}_p$ contains all the roots of $X^q - X$, it follows that\nthe field ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}$ contains a subfield isomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{F}}_q$. We will show later (Theorem\u00a0\\[subfields\\]) that this\nis the only way that extensions of finite fields can arise. For now we\nwill construct the Galois group of the field extension\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$, which is normal by\nCorollary\u00a0\\[normal\\].\n\nThe Galois group of the field extension\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ is a cyclic group of size $m$\ngenerated by the $q^{\\rm th}$ power Frobenius map\n${\\operatorname{Frob}}_q$.\n\nThe fact that ${\\operatorname{Frob}}_q$ is an element of\n${\\operatorname{Gal}}({\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$, and that\n$({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^m = {\\operatorname{Frob}}_{q^m}$ is the\nidentity on ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}$, is obvious. Since the extension\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ is normal and of degree $m$, the\ngroup ${\\operatorname{Gal}}({\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$ must\nhave size $m$, and we will be done if we can show that\n$({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^k$, for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots,\nm-1$, are distinct elements of\n${\\operatorname{Gal}}({\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$.\n\nIt is enough to show that none of $({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^k$, for\n$k = 1, 2,\n\\ldots, m-1$, is the identity map on ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}$, for then we\nwill have shown that ${\\operatorname{Frob}}_q$ is of order exactly equal\nto $m$. But, if any such $({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^k$ were the identity\nmap, then the polynomial $X^{q^k}\n- X$ would have $q^m$ distinct roots in ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}$, which is\nimpossible in a field since $q^k < q^m$.\n\nWe can now use the Galois correspondence between subgroups of the Galois\ngroup and intermediate fields of a field extension to immediately\nclassify all the intermediate fields in the extension\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n\n\\[subfields\\] The field extension ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$\ncontains exactly one intermediate field isomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^d}$, for each divisor $d$ of $m$, and no others. In\nparticular, the subfields of ${\\mathbb{F}}_{p^n}$ are precisely the\nfields ${\\mathbb{F}}_{p^d}$ for $d {\\mid}n$.\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, each intermediate field of\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ corresponds to a subgroup of\n${\\operatorname{Gal}}({\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}/{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$. The latter is\na cyclic group of order $m$, so its subgroups are exactly the cyclic\ngroups generated by $({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^d$, one for each\n$d {\\mid}m$. The fixed field of $({\\operatorname{Frob}}_q)^d$ is the set\nof roots of $X^{q^d} - X$, which forms a subfield of\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^m}$ isomorphic to ${\\mathbb{F}}_{q^d}$, so the result\nfollows.\n\nThe subfields of ${\\mathbb{F}}_{p^n}$ can be obtained by applying the\nabove considerations to the extension\n${\\mathbb{F}}_{p^n}/{\\mathbb{F}}_p$.\n\n[9]{} Kenneth Ireland & Michael Rosen, [*A Classical Introduction to\nModern Number Theory, Second Edition*]{}, Springer\u2013Verlag, 1990 (GTM\n[**84**]{}).
