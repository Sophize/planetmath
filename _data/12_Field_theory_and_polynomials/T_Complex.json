  "definition": "There are some polynomial equations with real coefficients that don\u2019t\nhave real solutions. Examples of these are $x^2+5=0$, $x^2+x+1=0$.\nMathematically we express this by saying that $\\mathbb{R}$ is not an\nalgebraically closed field.\n\nIn to solve that kind of equation, we have to \u201cextend\u201d our number system\n$\\mathbb{R}$ by adjoining a number $i$ that has the property that\n$i^2=-1$. In this way we extend the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$\nto a field $\\mathbb{C}$ whose elements are called **. A formal\nconstruction can be seen at \\[\\] (cf. the field adjunction). The field\n$\\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed: every polynomial with complex\ncoefficients, and especially every polynomial with real coefficients,\n(and with positive degree) has at least one complex zero (which might be\nreal as well).\n\nAny complex number can be written as $z = x+iy$ (with\n$x,\\,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$). Here we call $x$ the [*real part*]{} of $z$ and\n$y$ the [*imaginary part*]{} of $z$. We write this as\n$$x=\\mbox{Re}(z), \\qquad y=\\mbox{Im}(z).$$ Real numbers are a subset of\ncomplex numbers, and a real number $r$ can be written also as $r+i0$.\nThus, a complex number is real if and only if its imaginary part is\nequal to zero.\n\nBy writing $x\\!+\\!iy$ as $(x,\\,y)$ we can also look at complex numbers\nas ordered pairs. With this notation, real numbers are the pairs of the\nform $(r,\\,0)$.\n\nThe rules of addition and multiplication for complex numbers are:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(a+ib)+(x+iy)=(a+x)+i(b+y)&\\qquad&(a,\\,b)+(x,\\,y) = (a+x,\\,b+y)\\\\\n(a+ib)\\cdot(x+iy)=(ax-by)+i(ay+bx)&\\qquad&(a,\\,b)\\cdot(x,\\,y)=(ax-by,\\,ay+bx)\\end{aligned}$$\n(to see why the last identity holds, expand the first product and then\nsimplify by using $i^2 = -1$).\n\nWe have also the : $-(a,\\,b) =\n(-a,\\,-b)$ and the multiplicative inverses:\n$$(a,\\,b)^{-1}=\\left(\\frac{a}{a^2+b^2},\\,\\frac{-b}{a^2+b^2}\\right).$$\n\nSeeing complex numbers as ordered pairs also let us give $\\mathbb{C}$\nthe structure of vector space (over $\\mathbb{R}$). The *norm* of\n$z = x+iy$ is defined as $$|z| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.$$ Then we have\n$|z|^2=z\\overline{z}$ where $\\overline{z}$ is the *conjugate* of\n$z = x+iy$ and it\u2019s defined as $\\overline{z} = x-iy$. Thus we can also\ncharacterize real numbers as those complex numbers $z$ such that\n$z=\\overline{z}$.\n\nConjugation obeys the following rules: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{z_1+z_2}&=&\\overline{z_1}+\\overline{z_2}\\\\\n\\overline{z_1z_2}&=&\\overline{z_1}\\,\\overline{z_2}\\\\\n\\overline{\\overline{z}}&=& z\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be expressed with\nthe conjugate as\n$$\\mbox{Re}(z) = \\frac{z+\\overline{z}}{2}, \\quad \\mbox{Im}(z) = \\frac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.$$\n\nThe ordered-pair notation lets us visualize complex numbers as points in\nthe plane; this is called the [*complex plane*]{}, often also the\n[*$z$-plane*]{}. As well, we can also describe complex numbers with\npolar coordinates.\n\n![image](argand)\n\nUsing this representation, we see that the real numbers are located at\nthe abscissa (horizontal) axis, which is then known as the real axis.\nThe ordinate (vertical) axis is known as the imaginary axis, since it\nconsists of all complex numbers with real part equal to zero.\n\nIf $z = a+ib$ is represented in polar coordinates as $(r,\\,t)$ we call\n$r$ the of $z$ and $t$ its *argument*.\n\nIf $r = a+ib = (r,\\,t)$, then $a = r\\sin{t}$ and $b = r\\cos{t}$. So we\nhave the following expression, called the [*polar form*]{} of complex\nnumber $z$: $$z = a+ib = r(\\cos{t}+i\\sin{t})$$\n\nMultiplication of complex numbers can be done in a very neat way using\npolar coordinates: $$(r_1,\\,t_1)(r_2,\\,t_2) = (r_1r_2,\\,t_1\\!+\\!t_2).$$\n\n**Remark.** The adjective [*complex*]{} qualifying such nouns as\n\u201cnumber\u201d, \u201croot\u201d and \u201csolution\u201d is in the English ambiguous; it may mean\nthat it is a question of a element belonging to either $\\mathbb{C}$ or\nto $\\mathbb{C}\\!\\smallsetminus\\!\\mathbb{R}$, i.e. the may either have\nits basic sense or mean \u2018non-real\u2019.",
