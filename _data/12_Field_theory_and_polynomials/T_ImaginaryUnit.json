  "definition": "The *imaginary unit* $i {:=}\\sqrt{-1}$. Any imaginary number $m$ may be\nwritten as $m = b i$, $b \\in {\\mathbb{R}}$. Any complex number\n$c \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$ may be written as $c = a + b i$,\n$a,b \\in {\\mathbb{R}}$.\n\nNote that there are two complex square roots of $-1$ (i.e. the two\nsolutions to the equation $x^2+1=0$ in $\\mathbb{C}$), so there is always\nsome ambiguity in which of these we choose to call \u201c$i$\u201d and which we\ncall \u201c$-i$\u201d, though this has little bearing on any applications of\ncomplex numbers.\n\nIn physics and some engineering fields, the symbol $j$ is used for the\nimaginary unit.",
