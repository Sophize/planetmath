  "definition": "Let $F/K$ be an extension of number fields and let $\\mathcal{O}_F$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}_K$ be their respective rings of integers. The ring of\nintegers of a number field is a Dedekind domain, and these enjoy the\nproperty that every ideal ${{\\mathfrak{A}}}$ factors uniquely as a\nfinite product of prime ideals (see the entry ). Let ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\nbe a prime ideal of ${\\mathcal{O}_K}$. Then\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}_F}$ is an ideal of ${\\mathcal{O}_F}$. Let\nus assume that the prime ideal factorization of\n${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}_F}$ into primes of ${\\mathcal{O}_F}$ is as\nfollows: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq1} {{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}_F}=\\prod_{i=1}^r {{{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i}^{e_i}\\end{aligned}$$\nWe say that the primes ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ lie above ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\nand ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ (divides). The exponent $e_i$\n(commonly denoted as $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$) is the\nramification index of ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$.\nNotice that for each prime ideal ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$, the quotient ring\n${\\mathcal{O}_F}/{{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ is a finite field extension of the\nfinite field ${\\mathcal{O}_K}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ (also called the residue\nfield). The degree of this extension is called the inertial degree of\n${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and it is usually denoted\nby:\n$$f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=[{\\mathcal{O}_F}/{{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i:{\\mathcal{O}_K}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}].$$\n\nNotice that as it is pointed out in the entry \u201c\u201d, the ramification index\nand the inertial degree are related by the formula: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq2}\n\\sum_{i=1}^r e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=[F:K]\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $r$ is the number of prime ideals lying above ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\n(as in Eq. (\\[eq1\\])). See the theorem below for an improvement of Eq.\n(\\[eq2\\]) in the case when $F/K$ is Galois.\n\nLet $F,K$ and ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i,{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ be as above.\n\n1.  If $e_i>1$ for some $i$, then we say that ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ is\n    [**ramified**]{} over ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ and ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$\n    ramifies in $F/K$. If $e_i=1$ for all $i$ then we say that\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ is unramified in $F/K$.\n\n2.  If there is a unique prime ideal ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}$ lying above\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ (so $r=1$) and\n    $f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=1$ then we say that\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ is [**totally ramified**]{} in $F/K$. In this\n    case $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=[F:K]$.\n\n3.  On the other hand, if\n    $e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})=1$\n    for all $i$, we say that ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$ is [**totally split**]{}\n    (or splits completely) in $F/K$. Notice that there are exactly\n    $r=[F:K]$ prime ideals of ${\\mathcal{O}_F}$ lying above\n    ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}$.\n\n4.  Let $p$ be the characteristic of the residue field\n    ${\\mathcal{O}_K}/{{\\mathfrak{p}}}$. If\n    $e_i=e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})>1$ and $e_i$ and $p$ are\n    relatively prime, then we say that ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ is [**tamely\n    ramified**]{}. If $p|e_i$ then we say that ${{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i$ is\n    [**strongly ramified**]{} (or wildly ramified).\n\nWhen the extension $F/K$ is a Galois extension then Eq. (\\[eq2\\]) is\nquite more simple:\n\nAssume that $F/K$ is a Galois extension of number fields. Then all the\nramification indices $e_i=e({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ are\nequal to the same number $e$, all the inertial degrees\n$f_i=f({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i|{{\\mathfrak{p}}})$ are equal to the same\nnumber $f$ and the ideal ${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}_F}$ factors as:\n$${{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}_F}= \\prod_{i=1}^r {{\\mathfrak{P}}}_i^e=({{\\mathfrak{P}}}_1\\cdot{{\\mathfrak{P}}}_2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot{{\\mathfrak{P}}}_r)^e$$\nMoreover: $$e\\cdot f\\cdot r=[F:K].$$",
