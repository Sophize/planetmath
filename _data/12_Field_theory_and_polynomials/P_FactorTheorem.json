  "statement": "If $f(x)$ is a polynomial over a ring with identity, then $x-a$ is a\nfactor if and only if $a$ is a root (that is, $f(a)=0$).\n\nThis theorem is of great help for finding factorizations of higher\ndegree polynomials. As example, let us think that we need to factor the\npolynomial $p(x)=x^3+3x^2-33x-35$. With some help of the rational root\ntheorem we can find that $x=-1$ is a root (that is, $p(-1)=0$), so we\nknow $(x+1)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can write then\n$$p(x)=(x+1)q(x)$$ where the polynomial $q(x)$ can be found using long\nor synthetic division of $p(x)$ between $x-1$. In our case\n$q(x)=x^2+2x-35$ which can be easily factored as $(x-5)(x+7)$. We\nconclude that $$p(x)=(x+1)(x-5)(x+7).$$",
