  "statement": "(Cauchy,Kronecker) Let $K$ be a field. For any irreducible polynomial\n$f$ in $K[X]$ there is an extension field of $K$ in which $f$ has a\nroot.\n\nIf $I$ is the ideal generated by $f$ in $K[X]$, since $f$ is\nirreducible, $I$ is a maximal ideal of $K[X]$, and consequently $K[X]/I$\nis a field. We can construct a canonical monomorphism $v$ from $K$ to\n$K[X]$. By tracking back the field operation on $K[X]/I$, $v$ can be\nextended to an isomorphism $w$ from an extension field $L$ of $K$ to\n$K[X]/I$. We show that $\\alpha = w^{-1}(X+I)$ is a root of $f$. If we\nwrite $f = \\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i X^i$ then $f+I = 0$ implies:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nw(f(\\alpha)) \n&= w(\\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i \\alpha^i) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^n w(f_i) w(\\alpha)^i \\\\\n&=  \\sum_{i = 1}^n v(f_i) w(\\alpha)^i \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^n (f_i+I)(X+I)^i \\\\\n&= (\\sum_{i = 1}^n f_i X^i)+I \\\\ \n&= f + I = 0,\\end{aligned}$$ which means that $f(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\nLet $K$ be a field and let $M$ be a finite set of nonconstant\npolynomials in $K[X]$. Then there exists an extension field $L$ of $K$\nsuch that every polynomial in $M$ splits in $L[X]$\n\nIf $L$ is a field extension of $K$ then the nonconstant polynomials\n$f_1, f_2, ... ,f_n$ split in $L[X]$ iff the polynomial\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n f_i$ splits in $L[X]$. Now the proof easily follows from\nthe above lemma.",
