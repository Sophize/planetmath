  "definition": "Let $k$ be a field and $K$ be its algebraic closure. Suppose that\n$k\\neq K$. A *quadratic extension* $E$ over $k$ is a field $k< E\\leq K$\nsuch that $E=k(\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha\\in K-k$, where $\\alpha^2\\in k$.\n\nIf $a=\\alpha^2$, we often write $E=k(\\sqrt{a})$. Every element of $E$\ncan be written as $r+s\\sqrt{a}$, for some $r,s\\in k$. This\nrepresentation is unique and we see that $\\lbrace 1,\\sqrt{a}\\rbrace$ is\na basis for the vector space $E$ over $k$. In fact, we have the\nfollowing\n\n**Proposition.** If the characteristic of $k$ is not $2$, then $E$ is a\nquadratic extension over $k$ iff $\\operatorname{dim}(E)=2$ (as a vector\nspace) over $k$.\n\nOne direction is clear from the above discussion. So suppose\n$\\operatorname{dim}(E)=2$ over $k$ and $\\lbrace 1,\\beta \\rbrace$ is a\nbasis for $E$ over $k$. Then $\\beta^2=r+s\\beta$ for some $r,s\\in k$. Set\n$\\alpha=\\beta-\\frac{s}{2}$. Then clearly $\\alpha\\in E-k$ and\n$\\lbrace 1,\\alpha\\rbrace$ is also a basis for $E$ over $k$. Furthermore,\n$\\alpha^2= r+\\frac{s^2}{4}\\in k$. Thus, $k(\\alpha)$ is quadratic\nextension over $k$ and $[k(\\alpha):k]=2$. But $k(\\alpha)$ is a subfield\nof $E$. Then $2=[E:k]= [E:k(\\alpha)][k(\\alpha):k]=2[E:k(\\alpha)]$\nimplies that $[E:k(\\alpha)]=1$ and $E=k(\\alpha)$.\n\nIn the proposition above, the assumption that\n$\\operatorname{Char}(k)\\ne 2$ can not be dropped. If fact, quadratic\nextensions of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ do not exist, for if\n$\\alpha^2\\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$, then $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nFor the rest of the discussion, we assume that\n$\\operatorname{Char}(k)\\ne 2$.\n\nPick any element $\\beta=r+s\\sqrt{a}$ in $E-k$. Then $s\\neq 0$ and\n$(\\beta - r)^2=s^2a\\in k$. So $\\beta$ is a root of the irreducible\npolynomial $m(x)=x^2-2rx+(r^2-s^2a)$ in $k[x]$. If we define\n$\\overline{\\beta}$ to be $r-s\\sqrt{a}$, then $\\overline{\\beta}$ is the\nother root of $m(x)$, clearly also in $E-k$. This implies that the\nminimal polynomial of every element in $E$ has degree at most 2, and\nsplits into linear factors in $E[x]$.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Char}(k)\\ne 2$, $\\beta\\neq\\overline{\\beta}$ are two\ndistinct roots of $m(x)$. This shows that $k(\\sqrt{a})$ is separable\nover $k$.\n\nNow, let $f(x)$ be any irreducible polynomial over $k$ which has a root\n$\\beta$ in $E$. Then the minimal polynomial $m(x)$ of $\\beta$ in $k[x]$\nmust divide $f$. But because $f$ is irreducible, $m=f$. This shows that\n$k(\\sqrt{a})$ is normal over $k$. Since $k(\\sqrt{a})$ is both separable\nand normal over $k$, it is a Galois extension over $k$.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be an automorphism of $E=k(\\sqrt{a})$ fixing $k$. Then\n$\\phi(\\sqrt{a})$ is easily seen to be a root of the minimal polynomial\nof $\\sqrt{a}$. As a result, either $\\phi=1$ on $E$ or $\\phi$ is the\ninvolution that maps each $\\beta$ to $\\overline{\\beta}$. We have just\nproved\n\n**Theorem.** Suppose $\\operatorname{Char}(k)\\neq 2$. Any quadratic\nextension of $k$ is Galois over $k$, whose Galois group is isomorphic to\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Remark**. A quadratic extension (of a field) is also known in the\nliterature as a *$2$-extension*, a special case of a p-extension, when\n$p=2$.",
