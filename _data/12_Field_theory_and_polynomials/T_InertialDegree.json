  "definition": "Let $\\iota\\colon A \\to B$ be a ring homomorphism. Let\n${\\mathfrak{P}}\\subset B$ be a prime ideal, with\n${\\mathfrak{p}}:= \\iota^{-1}({\\mathfrak{P}}) \\subset A$. The algebra map\n$\\iota$ induces an $A/{\\mathfrak{p}}$ module structure on the ring\n$B/{\\mathfrak{P}}$. If the dimension of $B/{\\mathfrak{P}}$ as an\n$A/{\\mathfrak{p}}$ module exists, then it is called the *inertial\ndegree* of ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ over $A$.\n\nA particular case of special importance in number theory is when $L/K$\nis a field extension and\n$\\iota\\colon {\\mathcal{O}}_K \\to {\\mathcal{O}}_L$ is the inclusion map\nof the ring of integers. In this case, the domain\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K/{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a field, so\n$\\dim_{{\\mathcal{O}}_K/{\\mathfrak{p}}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L/{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is\nguaranteed to exist, and the inertial degree of ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ over\n${\\mathcal{O}}_K$ is denoted $f({\\mathfrak{P}}/{\\mathfrak{p}})$. We have\nthe formula\n$$\\sum_{{\\mathfrak{P}}\\mid {\\mathfrak{p}}} e({\\mathfrak{P}}/{\\mathfrak{p}}) f({\\mathfrak{P}}/{\\mathfrak{p}}) = [L:K],$$\nwhere $e({\\mathfrak{P}}/{\\mathfrak{p}})$ is the ramification index of\n${\\mathfrak{P}}$ over ${\\mathfrak{p}}$ and the sum is taken over all\nprime ideals ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ of ${\\mathcal{O}}_L$ dividing\n${\\mathfrak{p}}{\\mathcal{O}}_L$. The prime ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ (and also\nthe prime ${\\mathfrak{p}}$) is said to be *inert* if\n$f({\\mathfrak{P}}/{\\mathfrak{p}}) = [L:K]$.\n\n[**Example:**]{}\n\nLet $\\iota\\colon {\\mathbb{Z}}\\to {\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$ be the inclusion of\nthe integers into the Gaussian integers. A prime $p$ in ${\\mathbb{Z}}$\nmay or may not factor in ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$; if it does factor, then it\nmust factor as $p = (x+yi)(x-yi)$ for some integers $x,y$. Thus a prime\n$p$ factors into two primes if it equals $x^2 + y^2$, and remains prime\nin ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$ otherwise. There are then three categories of\nprimes in ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$:\n\n1.  The prime 2 factors as $(1+i)(1-i)$, and the principal ideals\n    generated by $(1+i)$ and $(1-i)$ are equal in ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$, so\n    the ramification index of $(1+i)$ over ${\\mathbb{Z}}$ is two. The\n    ring $Z[i]/(1+i)$ is isomorphic to ${\\mathbb{Z}}/2$, so the inertial\n    degree $f((1+i)/(2))$ is one.\n\n2.  For primes $p \\equiv 1 \\bmod{4}$, the prime $p \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}$\n    factors into the product of the two primes $(x+yi)(x-yi)$, with\n    ramification index and inertial degree one.\n\n3.  For primes $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the prime $p$ remains prime in\n    ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]$ and ${\\mathbb{Z}}[i]/(p)$ is a two dimensional\n    field extension of ${\\mathbb{Z}}/p$, so the inertial degree is two\n    and the ramification index is one.\n\nIn all cases, the sum of the products of the inertial degree and\nramification index is equal to 2, which is the dimension of the\ncorresponding extension ${\\mathbb{Q}}(i)/{\\mathbb{Q}}$ of number fields.\n\nLocal interpretations & generalizations\n=======================================\n\nFor any extension $\\iota\\colon A \\to B$ of Dedekind domains, the\ninertial degree of the prime ${\\mathfrak{P}}\\subset B$ over the prime\n${\\mathfrak{p}}:= \\iota^{-1}({\\mathfrak{P}}) \\subset A$ is equal to the\ninertial degree of ${\\mathfrak{P}}B_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ over\n${\\mathfrak{p}}A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ in the localizations at\n${\\mathfrak{P}}$ and ${\\mathfrak{p}}$. Moreover, the same is true even\nif we pass to completions of the local rings $B_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ and\n$A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ at ${\\mathfrak{P}}$ and ${\\mathfrak{p}}$. The\npreservation of inertial degree and ramification indices with respect to\nlocalization is one of the reasons why the technique of localization is\na useful tool in the study of such domains.\n\nAs in the case of ramification indices, it is possible to define the\nnotion of inertial degree in the more general setting of locally ringed\nspaces. However, the generalizations of inertial degree are not as\nwidely used because in algebraic geometry one usually works with a fixed\nbase field, which makes all the residue fields at the points equal to\nthe same field.",
