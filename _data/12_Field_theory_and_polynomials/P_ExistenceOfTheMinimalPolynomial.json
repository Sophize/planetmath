  "statement": "Let $K/L$ be a finite extension of fields and let $k\\in K$. There exists\na unique polynomial $m_{k}(x)\\in L[x]$ such that:\n\n1.  $m_{k}(x)$ is a monic polynomial;\n\n2.  $m_{k}(k)=0$;\n\n3.  If $p(x)\\in L[x]$ is another polynomial such that $p(k)=0$, then\n    $m_{k}(x)$ divides $p(x)$.\n\nWe start by defining the following map: $$\\psi\\colon L[x] \\to K$$\n$$\\psi(p(x))=p(k)$$ Note that this map is clearly a ring homomorphism.\nFor all $p(x),q(x) \\in L[x]$:\n\n-   $\\psi(p(x)+q(x))=p(k)+q(k)=\\psi(p(x))+\\psi(q(x))$\n\n-   $\\psi(p(x)\\cdot q(x))=p(k)\\cdot\n    q(k)=\\psi(p(x))\\cdot\\psi(q(x))$\n\nThus, the kernel of $\\psi$ is an ideal of $L[x]$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)=\\{ p(x)\\in L[x] \\mid p(k)=0 \\}$$ Note that\nthe kernel is a [**non-zero**]{} ideal. This fact relies on the fact\nthat $K/L$ is a finite extension of fields, and therefore it is an\nalgebraic extension, so every element of $K$ is a root of a non-zero\npolynomial $p(x)$ with coefficients in $L$, this is,\n$p(x)\\in \\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)$.\n\nMoreover, the ring of polynomials $L[x]$ is a principal ideal domain\n(see example of PID). Therefore, the kernel of $\\psi$ is a principal\nideal, generated by some polynomial $m(x)$:\n$$\\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)=(m(x))$$ Note that the only units in $L[x]$\nare the constant polynomials, hence if $m'(x)$ is another generator of\n$\\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)$ then\n$$m'(x)=l\\cdot m(x), \\quad l\\neq 0,\\quad l\\in L$$ Let $\\alpha$ be the\nleading coefficient of $m(x)$. We define $m_{k}(x)=\\alpha^{-1}m(x)$, so\nthat the leading coefficient of $m_{k}$ is $1$. Also note that by the\nprevious remark, $m_{k}$ is the unique generator of\n$\\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)$ which is monic.\n\nBy construction, $m_{k}(k)=0$, since $m_{k}$ belongs to the kernel of\n$\\psi$, so it satisfies $(2)$.\n\nFinally, if $p(x)$ is any polynomial such that $p(k)=0$, then\n$p(x) \\in \\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)$. Since $m_{k}$ generates this ideal,\nwe know that $m_{k}$ must divide $p(x)$ (this is property $(3)$).\n\nFor the uniqueness, note that any polynomial satisfying $(2)$ and $(3)$\nmust be a generator of $\\operatorname{Ker}(\\psi)$, and, as we pointed\nout, there is a unique monic generator, namely $m_{k}(x)$.",
