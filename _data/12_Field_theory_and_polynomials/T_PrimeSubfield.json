  "definition": "The [*prime subfield*]{} of a field $F$ is the intersection of all\nsubfields of $F$, or equivalently the smallest subfield of $F$. It can\nalso be constructed by taking the quotient field of the additive\nsubgroup of $F$ generated by the multiplicative identity $1$.\n\nIf $F$ has characteristic $p$ where $p > 0$ is a prime, then the prime\nsubfield of $F$ is isomorphic to the field $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ of\nintegers mod $p$. When $F$ has characteristic zero, the prime subfield\nof $F$ is isomorphic to the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers.",
