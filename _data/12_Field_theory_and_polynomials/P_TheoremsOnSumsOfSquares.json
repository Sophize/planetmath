  "statement": "Let $F$ be a field with characteristic not $2$. The sum of squares\nidentity of the form\n$$(x_1^2+\\cdots+x_n^2)(y_1^2+\\cdots+y_n^2)=z_1^2+\\cdots+z_n^2$$ where\neach $z_k$ is bilinear over $x_i$ and $y_j$ (with coefficients in $F$),\nis possible iff $n=1,2,4,8$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  When the ground field is $\\mathbb{R}$, this theorem is equivalent to\n    the fact that the only normed real division alternative algebra is\n    one of $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, $\\mathbb{H}$, $\\mathbb{O}$, as\n    one observes that the sums of squares can be interpreted as the\n    square of the norm defined for each of the above algebras.\n\n2.  An equivalent characterization is that the above four mentioned\n    algebras are the only real composition algebras.\n\nA generalization of the above is the following:\n\nLet $F$ be a field of characteristic not $2$. The sum of squares\nidentity of the form\n$$(x_1^2+\\cdots+x_n^2)(y_1^2+\\cdots+y_n^2)=z_1^2+\\cdots+z_n^2$$ where\neach $z_k$ is a rational function of $x_i$ and $y_j$ (element of\n$F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y_1,\\ldots,y_n)$), is possible iff $n$ is a power of\n$2$.\n\n**Remark**. The form of Pfister\u2019s theorem is stated in a way so as to\nmirror the form of Hurwitz theorem. In fact, Pfister proved the\nfollowing: if $F$ is a field and $n$ is a power of 2, then there exists\na sum of squares identity of the form\n$$(x_1^2+\\cdots+x_n^2)(y_1^2+\\cdots+y_n^2)=z_1^2+\\cdots+z_n^2$$ such\nthat each $z_k$ is a rational function of the $x_i$ and a linear\nfunction of the $y_j$, or that\n$$z_k=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}r_{kj}y_j\\qquad\\mbox{where }r_{kj}\\in\nF(x_1,\\ldots,x_n).$$ Conversely, if $n$ is not a power of $2$, then\nthere exists a field $F$ such that the above sum of square identity does\nnot hold for *any* $z_i\\in\nF(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y_1,\\ldots,y_n)$. Notice that $z_i$ is no longer\nrequired to be a linear function of the $y_j$ anymore.\n\nWhen $F$ is the field of reals $\\mathbb{R}$, we have the following\ngeneralization, also due to Pfister:\n\nIf $f\\in\\mathbb{R}(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)$ is positive semidefinite, then $f$\ncan be written as a sum of $2^n$ squares.\n\nThe above theorem is very closely related to Hilbert\u2019s 17th Problem:\n\n[**Hilbert\u2019s 17th Problem.**]{} *Whether it is possible, to write a\npositive semidefinite rational function in $n$ indeterminates over the\nreals, as a sum of squares of rational functions in $n$ indeterminates\nover the reals?*\n\nThe answer is yes, and it was proved by Emil Artin in 1927.\nAdditionally, Artin showed that the answer is also yes if the reals were\nreplaced by the rationals.\n\n[8]{} A.
