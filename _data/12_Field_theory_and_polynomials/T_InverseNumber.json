  "definition": "The [*inverse number*]{} or [*reciprocal number*]{} of a non-zero real\nor complex number $a$ may be denoted by $a^{-1}$, and it the quotient\n$\\frac{1}{a}$ (so, it is really the $-1^\\mathrm{th}$ power of $a$).\n\n-   Two numbers are inverse numbers of each other if and only if their\n    product is equal to 1 (cf. opposite inverses).\n\n-   If $a$ ($\\neq 0$) is given in a quotient form $\\frac{b}{c}$, then\n    its inverse number is simply\n    $$\\left(\\frac{b}{c}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{c}{b}.$$\n\n-   Forming the inverse number is also a multiplicative function, i.e.\n    $$(bc)^{-1} = b^{-1}c^{-1}$$ (to be more precise, it is an\n    automorphism of the multiplicative group of $\\mathbb{R}$ resp.\n    $\\mathbb{C}$).",
