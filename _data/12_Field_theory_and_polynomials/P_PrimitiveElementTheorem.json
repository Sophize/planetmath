  "statement": "Let $F$ and $K$ be arbitrary fields, and let $K$ be an extension of $F$\nof finite degree. Then there exists an element $\\alpha\\in K$ such that\n$K=F(\\alpha)$ if and only if there are finitely many fields $L$ with\n$F\\subseteq L\\subseteq K$.\n\nNote that this implies that every finite separable extension is not only\nfinitely generated, it is generated by a single element.\n\nLet $X$ be an indeterminate. Then $\\mathbb{Q}(X,i)$ is not generated\nover $\\mathbb{Q}$ by a single element (and there are infinitely many\nintermediate fields $\\mathbb{Q}(X,i)/L/\\mathbb{Q}$). To see this,\nsuppose it is generated by an element $\\alpha$. Then clearly $\\alpha$\nmust be transcendental, or it would generate an extension of finite\ndegree. But if $\\alpha$ is transcendental, we know it is isomorphic to\n$\\mathbb{Q}(X)$, and this field is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Q}(X,i)$:\nfor example, the polynomial $Y^2+1$ has no roots in the first but it has\ntwo roots in the second. It is also clear that it is not sufficient for\nevery element of $K$ to be algebraic over $F$: we know that the\nalgebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ has infinite degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$,\nbut if $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ then\n$[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]$ will be finite.\n\nThis theorem has the corollary:\n\nLet $F$ be a field, and let $[F(\\beta,\\gamma):F]$ be finite and\nseparable. Then there exists $\\alpha \\in F(\\beta,\\gamma)$ such that\n$F(\\beta,\\gamma)=F(\\alpha)$. In fact, we can always take $\\alpha$ to be\nan $F$- of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n\nTo see this (in the case of characteristic $0$), we need only show that\nthere are finitely many intermediate fields. But any intermediate field\nis contained in the splitting field of the minimal polynomials of\n$\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, which is Galois with finite Galois group. The\nexplicit form of $\\alpha$ comes from the proof of the theorem.\n\nFor more detail on this theorem and its proof see, for example, *Field\nand Galois Theory*, by Patrick Morandi (Springer Graduate Texts in\nMathematics 167, 1996).",
