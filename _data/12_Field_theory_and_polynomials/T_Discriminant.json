  "definition": "#### Summary.\n\nThe *discriminant* of a given polynomial is a number, calculated from\nthe coefficients of that polynomial, that vanishes if and only if that\npolynomial has one or more multiple roots. Using the discriminant we can\ntest for the presence of multiple roots, without having to actually\ncalculate the roots of the polynomial in question.\n\nThere are other ways to do this of course; one can look at the formal\nderivative of the polynomial (it will be coprime to the original\npolynomial if and only if that original had no multiple roots). But the\ndiscriminant turns out to be valuable in a number of other contexts. For\nexample, we will see that the discriminant of $X^2+bX+c$ is $b^2-4c$;\nthe quadratic formula states that the roots are\n$-b/2 \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4c}/2$, so that the discriminant also determines\nwhether the roots of this polynomial are real or not. In higher degrees,\nits role is more complicated.\n\nThere are other uses of the word \u201cdiscriminant\u201d that are closely related\nto this one. If $\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is a number field, then the of\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ is the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of\n$\\alpha$. For more general extensions of number fields, one must use a\ndifferent definition of discriminant generalizing this one. If we have\nan elliptic curve over the rational numbers defined by the equation\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax +B$, then its modular discriminant is the discriminant\nof the cubic polynomial on the right-hand side. For more on both these\nfacts, see [@marcus] on number fields and [@silv] on elliptic curves.\n\n#### Definition.\n\nThe discriminant of order $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ is the polynomial, denoted\nhere [^1] by ${\\delta^{(n)}}= {\\delta^{(n)}}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$,\ncharacterized by the following relation:\n$${\\delta^{(n)}}(s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_n) =\n\\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=i+1}^n (x_i-x_j)^2,$$ where\n$$s_k= s_k(x_1,\\ldots,x_n),\\quad k=1,\\ldots,n$$ is the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$\nelementary symmetric polynomial.\n\nThe above relation is a defining one, because the right-hand side of (1)\nis, evidently, a symmetric polynomial, and because the algebra of\nsymmetric polynomials is freely generated by the basic symmetric\npolynomials, i.e. every symmetric polynomial arises in a unique fashion\nas a polynomial of $s^1,\\ldots,s^n$.\n\nThe discriminant $d$ of a polynomial may be expressed with the resultant\n$R$ of the polynomial and its first derivative:\n$$d \\;=\\; (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}R/a_n$$\\\n\nUp to sign, the discriminant is given by the determinant of a $2n\\!-\\!1$\nsquare matrix with columns 1 to $n\\!-\\!1$ formed by shifting the\nsequence $1,\\,a_1,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_n$, and columns $n$ to $2n\\!-\\!1$ formed\nby shifting the sequence $n,\\,(n\\!-\\!1)a_1,\\;\\ldots,\\;a_{n-1}$, i.e.\n\n[ $$\\label{eq:detform}\n    {\\delta^{(n)}}= \\left | \n      \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n        1   & 0   & \\ldots & 0 & n   & 0   & \\ldots & 0 &0\\\\\n        a_1 & 1   & \\ldots & 0 & (n-1)\\,a_1 & n   & \\ldots & 0&0 \\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots &\n        \\vdots & \\vdots\\\\ \n        a_{n-2} & a_{n-3} & \\ldots & 1 & 2\\,a_{n-2} & 3\\,a_{n-3} &\n        \\ldots & n & 0\\\\   \n        a_{n-1}  & a_{n-2} & \\ldots & a_1 & a_{n-1} & 2\\,a_{n-2} &\n        \\ldots & (n-1) a_1 & n\\\\\n        a_{n}  & a_{n-1} & \\ldots & a_2  & 0 & a_{n-1} & \\ldots &\n        (n-2) a_2  & (n-1) a_1\\\\\n        \\vdots  & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots\n        & \\vdots & \\vdots\\\\\n        0 & 0  & \\ldots & a_{n-1}  &0  &0\n        &\\ldots & a_{n-1}& 2\\,a_{n-2} \\\\\n        0 & 0 &  \\ldots  & a_n & 0 & 0 &\\ldots &0 & a_{n-1} \n      \\end{array}\\right|$$]{}\n\n#### Multiple root test.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb{K}}$ be a field, let $x$ denote an indeterminate, and let\n$$p = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_{n-1} x + a_n,\\quad\na_i\\in{\\mathbb{K}}$$ be a monic polynomial over ${\\mathbb{K}}$. We\ndefine $\\delta[p]$, the discriminant of $p$, by setting\n$$\\delta[p] = {\\delta^{(n)}}{\\left(}a_1,\\ldots, a_n{\\right)}.$$ The\ndiscriminant of a non-monic polynomial is defined homogenizing the above\ndefinition, i.e by setting\n$$\\delta[a p] = a^{2n-2} \\delta[p],\\quad a\\in{\\mathbb{K}}.$$\n\nThe discriminant vanishes if and only if $p$ has multiple roots in its\nsplitting field.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to show that a polynomial has multiple roots if and only\nif that polynomial and its derivative share a common root. The desired\nconclusion now follows by observing that the determinant formula in\nequation gives the resolvent of a polynomial and its derivative. This\nresolvent vanishes if and only if the polynomial in question has a\nmultiple root.\n\n#### Some Examples.\n\nHere are the first few discriminants. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta^{(1)}  &=1\\\\\n\\delta^{(2)}  &=a_1^2 - 4\\,  a_2\\\\\n\\delta^{(3)}  &=18\\,  a_1 a_2 a_3 + a_1^2 a_2^2 - 4\\,  a_2^3 - 4\\,\na_1^3 a_3 - 27 a_3^2 \\\\\n\\delta^{(4)} &= \na_1^2a_2^2a_3^2 - 4\\,a_2^3a_3^2 - 4\\,a_1^3a_3^3 + \n    18\\,a_1a_2a_3^3 - 27\\,a_3^4\\\\\n& - 4\\,a_1^2a_2^3a_4 +    16\\,a_2^4a_4 + \n 18\\,a_1^3a_2a_3a_4 - \n    80\\,a_1a_2^2a_3a_4\\\\\n& - 6\\,a_1^2a_3^2a_4 +    144\\,a_2a_3^2a_4   - 27\\,a_1^4a_4^2 + \n    144\\,a_1^2a_2a_4^2 \\\\\n&- 128\\,a_2^2a_4^2 - \n    192\\,a_1a_3a_4^2 + 256\\,a_4^3\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHere is the matrix used to calculate $\\delta^{(4)}$: $$\\delta^{(4)} = \n\\left | \n  \\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n    1   & 0   & 0   & 4    & 0    & 0  & 0 \\\\\n    a_1 & 1   & 0   & 3a_1 & 4    & 0  & 0 \\\\\n    a_2 & a_1 & 1   & 2a_2 & 3a_1 & 4  & 0 \\\\\n    a_3 & a_2 & a_1 &  a_3 & 2a_2 &3a_1& 4 \\\\\n    a_4 & a_3 & a_2 &   0  &  a_3 &2a_2&3a_1\\\\\n      0 & a_4 & a_3 &    0 &    0 & a_3&2a_2\\\\\n      0 &   0 & a_4 &    0 &    0 &   0& a_3\\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right|$$\n\n[99]{}\n\nDaniel A.
