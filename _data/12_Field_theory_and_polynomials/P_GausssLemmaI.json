See also Gauss\u2019s Lemma II.\\\n\\\n*Gauss\u2019s Lemma I:* If $R$ is a UFD and $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both\nprimitive polynomials in $R[x]$, so is $f(x) g(x)$.\\\n\\\n*Proof:* Suppose $f(x) g(x)$ not primitive. We will show either $f(x)$\nor $g(x)$ isn\u2019t as well. $f(x) g(x)$ not primitive means that there\nexists some non-unit $d$ in $R$ that divides all the coefficients of\n$f(x) g(x)$. Let $p$ be an irreducible factor of $d$, which exists and\nis a prime element because $R$ is a UFD. We consider the quotient ring\nof $R$ by the principal ideal $pR$ generated by $p$, which is a prime\nideal since $p$ is a prime element. The canonical projection\n$R \\to R/pR$ induces a surjective ring homomorphism\n$\\theta:R[X]\\to(R/pR)[X]$, whose kernel consists of all polynomials all\nof whose coefficients are divisible by\u00a0$p$; these polynomials are\ntherefore not primitive.\n\nSince $pR$ is a prime ideal, $R/pR$ is an integral domain, so\n$(R/pR)[x]$ is also an integral domain. By hypothesis $\\theta$ sends the\nproduct $f(x)g(x)$ to $0\\in(R/pR)[X]$, which is therefore the product of\n$\\theta(f(x))$ and $\\theta(g(x))$, and one of these two factors in\n$(R/pR)[x]$ must be zero. But that means that $f(x)$ or $g(x)$ is in the\nkernel of $\\theta$, and therefore not primitive.",
