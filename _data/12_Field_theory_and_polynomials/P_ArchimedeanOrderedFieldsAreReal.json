  "statement": "In this entry, we shall show that every Archimedean ordered field is\nisomorphic to a subfield of the field of real numbers. To accomplish\nthis, we shall construct an isomorphism using Dedekind cuts.\n\nAs a preliminary, we agree to some conventions. Let $\\mathbb{F}$ denote\nan ordered field with ordering relation $>$. We will identify the\nintegers with multiples of the multiplicative identity of fields. We\nfurther assume that $\\mathbb{F}$ satisfies the Archimedean property: for\nevery element $x$ of $\\mathbb{F}$, there exists an integer $n$ such that\n$x < n$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{F}$ is an ordered field, it must have characteristic\nzero. Hence, the subfield generated by the multiplicative identity is\nisomorphic to the field of rational numbers. Following the convention\nproposed above, we will identify this subfield with $\\mathbb{Q}$. We use\nthis subfield to construct a map $\\rho$ from $\\mathbb{F}$ to\n$\\mathbb{R}$:\n\nFor every $x \\in \\mathbb{F}$, we define $$\\rho (x) = \n\\left(\n      \\{y \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid y > x \\} , \n      \\{y \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid y \\le x \\}\n\\right)$$\n\nFor every $x \\in \\mathbb{F}$, we find that $\\rho (x)$ is a Dedekind cut.\n\nBecause, for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, we have either $y > x$ or\n$y \\le x$, the two sets of $\\rho (x)$ form a partition of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFurthermore, every element of the latter set is less than every element\nof the former set. By the Archimedean property, there exists an integer\n$n$ such that $x < n$; hence the former set is not empty. Likewise,\nthere exists and integer $m$ such that $-x < m$, or $x > -m$, so the\nlatter set is also not empty.\n\nHaving seen that $\\rho$ is a bona fide map into the real numbers, we now\nshow that it is not just any old map, but a monomorphism of fields.\n\nThe map $\\rho \\colon \\mathbb{F} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a monomorphism.\n\nLet $p$ and $q$ be elements of $\\mathbb{F}$; set $(A,B) = \\rho(p)$, set\n$(C,D) = \n\\rho (q)$, and set $(E,F) = \\rho (p+q)$. Since $a > p$ and $b > q$\nimplies $a + b > p + q$ for all rational numbers $a$ and $b$, it follows\nthat $a \\in A$ and $b \\in C$ implies that $a + b \\in E$. Likewise, since\n$a \\le p$ and $b \\le q$ implies $a + b \\le p + q$ for all rational\nnumbers $a$ and $b$, it follows that $a \\in B$ and $b \\in D$ implies\n$a + b \\in F$. Hence, $\\rho (p) + \\rho (q) = \\rho (p + q)$.\n\nSince a rational number is positive if and only if it is greater than\n$0$, it follows that $\\rho (0) = 0$. Together with the fact proven in\nthe last paragraph, this implies that $\\rho (-x) = - \\rho (x)$ for all\n$x \\in \\mathbb{F}$.\n\nSuppose that $p$ and $q$ are positive elements of $\\mathbb{F}$. As\nbefore, set $(A,B) = \\rho(p)$, set $(C,D) = \\rho (q)$, and set\n$(E,F) = \\rho (p \\cdot q)$. Since $a > p$ and $b > q$ implies\n$a \\cdot b > p \\cdot q$ for all rational numbers $a$ and $b$, it follows\nthat $a \\in A$ and $b \\in C$ implies that $a\\cdot b \\in E$. Likewise,\nsince $a \\le p$ and $b \\le q$ implies $a \\cdot b \\le p \\cdot q$ for all\nrational numbers $a$ and $b$, it follows that $a \\in B$ and $b \\in D$\nimplies $a \\cdot b \\in F$. Hence,\n$\\rho (p) \\cdot \\rho (q) = \\rho (p \\cdot q)$.\n\nBy using the fact demonstrated previously that $\\rho (-x) = -\\rho (x)$,\nwe may extend what was shown above to the statement that\n$\\rho (p \\cdot q) = \\rho (p) \\cdot \\rho (q)$ for all\n$p,q \\in \\mathbb{F}$. Thus, $\\rho$ is a morphism of fields. Since\n$\\mathbb{F}$ is Archmiedean, if $p \\neq q$, there must exist a rational\nnumber $r$ between $p$ and $q$, hence $\\rho (p) \\neq \\rho(q)$, so $\\rho$\nis a monomorphism.\n\nSince $\\rho$ is a morphism of fields, its image is a subring of\n$\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\rho$ is a monomorphism, its restriction to this\nimage is an isomorphism, hence $\\mathbb{F}$ is isomorphic to a subfield\nof $\\mathbb{R}$.",
