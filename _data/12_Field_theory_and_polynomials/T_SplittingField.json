  "definition": "Let $f \\in F[x]$ be a polynomial over a field $F$. A [*splitting\nfield*]{} for $f$ is a field extension $K$ of $F$ such that\n\n1.  $f$ splits (factors into a product of linear factors) in $K[x]$,\n\n2.  $K$ is the smallest field with this property (any sub-extension\n    field of $K$ which satisfies the first property is equal to $K$).\n\n[**Theorem:**]{} Any polynomial over any field has a splitting field,\nand any two such splitting fields are isomorphic. A splitting field is\nalways a normal extension of the ground field.",
