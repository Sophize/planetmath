  "definition": "Loosely speaking, an *interval* is a part of the real numbers that start\nat one number and stops at another number. For instance, all numbers\ngreater that $1$ and smaller than $2$ form in interval. Another interval\nis formed by numbers greater or equal to $1$ and smaller than $2$. Thus,\nwhen talking about intervals, it is necessary to specify whether the\nendpoints are part of the interval or not. There are then four types of\nintervals with three different names: open, closed and half-open. Let us\nnext define these precisely.\n\n1.  The open interval contains neither of the endpoints. If $a$ and $b$\n    are real numbers, then the *open interval* of numbers between $a$\n    and $b$ is written as $(a,b)$ and\n    $$(a,b)=\\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid a<x<b\\}.$$\n\n2.  The closed interval contains both endpoints. If $a$ and $b$ are real\n    numbers, then the *closed interval* is written as $[a,b]$ and\n    $$[a,b]=\\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid a\\le x\\le b\\}.$$\n\n3.  A half-open interval contains only one of the endpoints. If $a$ and\n    $b$ are real numbers, the *half-open intervals* $(a,b]$ and $[a,b)$\n    are defined as $$\\begin{aligned}\n     (a,b] &=& \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid a<x\\le b\\},\\\\\n     \\,\\![a,b) &=&  \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid a\\le x< b\\}. \\end{aligned}$$\n\nNote that this definition includes the empty set as an interval by, for\nexample, taking the interval $(a,a)$ for any $a$.\n\nAn interval is a subset $S$ of a totally ordered set $T$ with the\nproperty that whenever $x$ and $y$ are in $S$ and $x < z < y$ then $z$\nis in $S$. Applied to the real numbers, this encompasses open, closed,\nhalf-open, half-infinite, infinite, empty, and one-point intervals. All\nthe various different types of interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ have this in\ncommon. Intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$ are connected under the usual\ntopology.\n\nThere is a standard way of graphically representing intervals on the\nreal line using filled and empty circles. This is illustrated in the\nbelow figures:\n\n![image](intervals.1.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.2.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.3.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.4.eps)\n\nThe logic is here that a empty circle represent a point not belonging to\nthe interval, while a filled circle represents a point belonging to the\ninterval. For example, the first interval is an open interval.\n\n### Infinite intervals {#infinite-intervals .unnumbered}\n\nIf we allow either (or both) of $a$ and $b$ to be infinite, then we\ndefine $$\\begin{aligned}\n(a,\\infty) &=& \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid x> a\\}, \\\\\n\\,\\![a,\\infty) &=& \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid x\\ge  a\\}, \\\\\n(-\\infty, a) &=& \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid x< a\\}, \\\\\n(-\\infty, a] &=& \\{ x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\mid x\\le  a\\}, \\\\\n(-\\infty, \\infty) &=& {\\mathbb{R}}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe graphical representation of infinite intervals is as follows:\n\n![image](intervals.5.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.6.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.7.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.8.eps)\n\n![image](intervals.9.eps)\n\n### Note on naming and notation {#note-on-naming-and-notation .unnumbered}\n\nIn [@rudin; @rudin_real], an open interval is always called a *segment*,\nand a closed interval is called simply an interval. However, the above\nnaming with open, closed, and half-open interval seems to be more widely\nadopted. See e.g. [@adams; @beta; @silverman]. To distinguish between\n$[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$, the former is sometimes called a *right half-open\ninterval* and the latter a *left half-open interval* [@igari]. The\nnotation $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$, $[a,b]$ seems to be standard.\nHowever, some authors (especially from the French school) use notation\n$]a,b[$, $[a,b[$, $]a,b]$, $[a,b]$ instead of the above (in the same ).\nBourbaki, for example, uses this notation.\n\n[*This entry contains content adapted from the Wikipedia article as of\nNovember 10, 2006.*]{}\n\n[9]{} W.
