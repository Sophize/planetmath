  "argumentText": "Let $F$ and $K$ be arbitrary fields, and let $K$ be an extension of $F$\nof finite degree. Then there exists an element $\\alpha\\in K$ such that\n$K=F(\\alpha)$ if and only if there are finitely many fields $L$ with\n$F\\subseteq L\\subseteq K$.\n\nLet $F$ and $K$ be fields, and let $[K:F]=n$ be finite.\n\nSuppose first that $K=F(\\alpha)$. Since $K/F$ is finite, $\\alpha$ is\nalgebraic over $F$. Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$\nover $F$. Now, let $L$ be an intermediary field with\n$F\\subseteq L\\subseteq K$ and let $m'(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of\n$\\alpha$ over $L$. Also, let $L'$ be the field generated by the\ncoefficients of the polynomial $m'(x)$. Thus, the minimal polynomial of\n$\\alpha$ over $L'$ is still $m'(x)$ and $L'\\subseteq L$. By the\nproperties of the minimal polynomial, and since $m(\\alpha)=0$, we have a\ndivisibility $m'(x)|m(x)$, and so: $$[K:L]=\\deg(m'(x))=[K:L'].$$ Since\nwe know that $L'\\subseteq L$, this implies that $L'=L$. Thus, this shows\nthat each intermediary subfield $F\\subseteq L \\subseteq K$ corresponds\nwith the field of definition of a (monic) factor of $m(x)$. Since the\npolynomial $m(x)$ has only finitely many monic factors, we conclude that\nthere can be only finitely many subfields of $K$ containing $F$.\n\nNow suppose conversely that there are only finitely many such\nintermediary fields $L$. If $F$ is a finite field, then so is $K$, and\nwe have an explicit description of all such possibilities; all such\nextensions are generated by a single element. So assume $F$ (and\ntherefore $K$) are infinite. Let $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\alpha_n$\nbe a basis for $K$ over $F$. Then $K=F(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$. So\nif we can show that any field extension generated by two elements is\nalso generated by one element, we will be done: simply apply the result\nto the last two elements $\\alpha_{j-1}$ and $\\alpha_j$ repeatedly until\nonly one is left.\n\nSo assume $K=F(\\beta,\\gamma)$. Consider the set of elements\n$\\{\\beta+a\\gamma\\}$ for $a\\in F^{\\times}$. By assumption, this set is\ninfinite, but there are only finitely many fields intermediate between\n$K$ and $F$; so two values must generate the same extension $L$ of $F$,\nsay $\\beta+a\\gamma$ and $\\beta+b\\gamma$. This field $L$ contains\n$$\\frac{(\\beta+a\\gamma)-(\\beta+b\\gamma)}{a-b} = \\gamma$$ and\n$$\\frac{(\\beta+a\\gamma)/a-(\\beta+b\\gamma)/b}{1/a-1/b} = \\beta$$ and so\nletting $\\alpha = \\beta+a\\gamma$, we see that\n$$F(\\alpha)=L=F(\\beta,\\gamma)=K.$$",
