  "definition": "Let $K$ be an extension field of $F$. A normal closure of $K/F$ is a\nfield $L \\supseteq K$ that is a normal extension of $F$ and is minimal\nin that respect, i.e. no proper subfield of $L$ containing $K$ is normal\nover $F$. If $K$ is an algebraic extension of $F$, then a normal closure\nfor $K/F$ exists and is unique up to isomorphism.",
