  "statement": "In this entry, $K$ is a field of characteristic zero and $V$ is an\nirreducible algebraic variety over $K$.\n\nA variety $V$ satisfies the Hilbert property over $K$ if $V(K)$ is not a\nthin algebraic set.\n\nA field $K$ is said to be Hilbertian if there exists an irreducible\nvariety $V/K$ of $\\dim V \\geq 1$ which has the Hilbert property.\n\nA number field $K$ is Hilbertian. In particular, for every $n$, the\naffine space $\\mathbb{A}^n(K)$ has the Hilbert property over $K$.\n\nHowever, the field of real numbers ${\\mathbb{R}}$ and the field of\n$p$-adic rationals ${\\mathbb{Q}}_p$ are not Hilbertian.\n\n[9]{} J.-P.
