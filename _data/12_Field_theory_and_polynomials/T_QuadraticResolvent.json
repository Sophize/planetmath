  "definition": "The [*quadratic resolvent*]{} of the cubic equation $$\\begin{aligned}\ny^3+py+q = 0,\\end{aligned}$$ where $p$ and $q$ are known complex\nnumbers, is the auxiliary equation\n$$z^2+qz-\\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^3 = 0$$ determining as its\n$$z_1 = u^3, \\qquad z_2 = v^3$$ the numbers $u$ and $v$ whose sum\n$y = u+v$ satisfies the equation (1). See .\n\nAnalogically, a quartic equation has a [*cubic resolvent*]{} (resolvent\ncubic) equation.",
