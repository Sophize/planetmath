  "definition": "The sextic Equation is the univariate polynomial of the sixth degree:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^6+ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f = 0.\\end{aligned}$$ Joubert showed in 1861\nthat this polynomial can be reduced without any form of accessory\nirrationalities to the 3-parameterized resolvent: $$\\begin{aligned}\nx^6+ax^4+bx^2+cx+c = 0.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis polynomial was studied in great detail by Felix Klein and Robert\nFricke in the 19th century and it is diectly related to the algebraic\naspect of Hilbert\u2019s 13th Problem. Its solution has been reduced (by\nKlein) to the solution of the so-called Valentiner Form problem, a\nternary form problem which seeks the ratios of the variables involved in\nthe invariant system of the Valentiner Group of order 360. It can also\nbe solved with a class of generalized hypergeometric series, by\nBirkeland\u2019s approach to algebraic equations. Scott Crass has given an\nexplicit solution to the Valentiner problem by purely iterational\nmethods, see",
