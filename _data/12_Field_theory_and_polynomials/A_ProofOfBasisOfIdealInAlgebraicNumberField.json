  "argumentText": "Although it is stated in a number field context this theorem is about\n$\\mathbb Z$-modules. $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is an integer ring, that is, it is\nthe integral closure of $\\mathbb Z$ in $K$. $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is naturally\nendowed with a structure of $\\mathbb Z$-module and so are all its ideals\n$\\mathfrak a$. Therefore the situation is that we have a\n$\\mathbb Z$-module (namely $\\mathfrak a$) that is embedded in a finite\ndimensional vector space over $\\mathbb Q$, namely $K$. It is a\nwell-known fact that discrete $\\mathbb Z$-modules of finite dimensional\nvector spaces over $\\mathbb Q$ are free modules with finite rank (ie.\nthey have a finite basis). This is exactly the claim of the theorem.\\\nTherefore to prove the theorem we only need prove that $\\mathfrak a$ is\ndiscrete ($K$ is by definition a finite dimensional vector space over\n$\\mathbb Q$ as it is an algebraic number field). Let\n$E:={\\mathbb Q}{\\mathfrak a}$, it is a finite dimensional\n$\\mathbb Q$-vector subspace of $K$. Let $n$ be the dimension of $K$ over\n$\\mathbb Q$, and $k$ the dimension of $E$ over $\\mathbb Q$. To say that\n$\\mathfrak a \\subset K\\cong {\\mathbb Q}^n$ is a discrete\n$\\mathbb Z$-module of $K$ is equivalent to say that every sequence of\nelements of $\\mathfrak a$ that converges in $\\mathfrak a$ for the usual\n(ie. for $x=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n){\\mathbb R}^n$,\n$||x||^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2$) is ultimately constant. It suffices to\nprove this for sequences that converges to $0$ (instead of an arbitrary\nelement of $\\mathfrak a$) because $\\mathfrak a$ is stable subset under\naddition (one can transform a sequence converging to any element of\n$\\mathfrak a$ into a sequence converging to $0$ by subtracting that\nelement to the sequence).\\\nSuppose there is a sequence of $\\mathfrak a$ that converges to $0$, we\nwant to prove that this sequence is ultimately constant with value $0$.\nThe elements of $\\mathfrak a$ can be seen as $\\mathbb Q$-linear\nendomorphisms of $K$, and their characteristic polynomials have\ncoefficients in $\\mathbb Z$ as they are in the integral closure of\n$\\mathbb Z$. In particular the determinant of these endomorphisms (which\nis called norm in this context) is an integer (the determinant is the\nconstant coefficient of the characteristic polynomial), and if it were\npossible to find a sequence of elements of ${\\mathfrak a}$ that\nconverges to $0$ the determinant would also converge to $0$ as it is a\ncontinuous function. But it has just been said that the the determinant\nis an integer for any element of $\\mathfrak a$, therefore for the\ndeterminants of the elements of the sequence to converge to $0$ they\nhave to be ultimately $0$, that is from a certain point on, the sequence\nis constantly equal to $0$. Since $K$ is a field all the mappings but\nthe $0$ mapping, are injective and therefore have non-zero norm.\nTherefore if the norm of the elements is $0$, it means that the elements\nthemselves were $0$. Hence we have proved that the sequence that\nconverged to $0$ was ultimately evenly $0$. We have thus proved that\n$\\mathfrak a$ is a discrete $\\mathbb Z$-module of $K$.\n\nAs a reminder, here is a proof of the afore-mentioned \u201cwell-known fact\u201d\nthat a discrete submodule of a finite dimensional vector space over\n$\\mathbb Q$ has a basis:\\\nFirst, we prove that can find a finite set of generators $\\mathfrak B$\nof $E$ whose elements are in $\\mathfrak a$. This is a straightforward\ninduction on the dimension of\n$\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$: start with\n${\\mathfrak B}=\\emptyset$, if there is element in $E$ that is not in\n$\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$, then there is an element of\n$\\mathfrak a$ that lies outside\n$\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$, add that element to\n$\\mathfrak B$ and keep on doing this until\n$\\dim \\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})=\\dim E$.\\\nAt that point $E/\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$ is a finite\nset: the quotient $E/\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$ can be\nrepresented as the subset of ${\\mathbb Q}^{\\dim E}$ of elements whose\nprojections to the element of $\\mathfrak B$ lies in $[0,1]$. In other\nwords $E/\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb Q}({\\mathfrak B})$ is isomorphic to the\ntorus $\\sum_{i=1}^{i=\\dim E} [0,1]{\\mathfrak B}_i$. This is a compact\nset, and therefore as $\\mathfrak a$ is discrete there are only finitely\nmany elements of $\\mathfrak a$ that lie in the torus. Therefore by\nadding the element of $\\mathfrak a$ that lie in the torus to\n$\\mathfrak B$, one obtains a finite set of generators of $\\mathfrak a$.\\\nAs $\\mathbb Z$ is a principal ideal ring, it is again well-known that\nmodules with finite rank (ie. that admit a finite set of generators)\nover a principal ideal ring can be represented as the product of a free\nmodule times a torsion module (with finite rank). Here there is no\ntorsion as it would mean there is an element of $\\mathfrak a$ that is\nsent to $0$ by multiplication by an integer, and this is impossible as\nintegers are elements of $K$ and $K$ is a field. Therefore $\\mathfrak a$\nitself is a free module (with finite rank).\\\nThe discriminant property can be seen intrinsically. Given an algebra of\nlinear maps, here ${\\mathfrak a}$, one can define the symmetric bilinear\nmap $a,b\\in E \\mapsto \\mathrm{Tr}(ab)$. If the algebra happens to have a\nbasis, which we have just proved in our case, then the determinant of\nthat map can be computed using the basis and this is what is called\ndiscriminant. But of course, the determinant of that map is not\ndependent on the basis...\\\nThe minimality property is in fact a property of Gram matrices for\nscalar products. The elements of $\\mathfrak a$ can be represented as\nelements of $\\mathrm{End}(E,E)\\cong{\\mathbb R}^{(\\dim E)^2}$ as they are\nlinear endomorphisms of $E$. The bilinear map\n$a,b\\in E \\mapsto \\mathrm{Tr}(ab)$ is then no more than the Gram matrix\nassociated to the vectors of the basis $\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_k$ of\n$\\mathfrak a$. Indeed, taking the trace of the product of two matrices\nit no more than taking the sum of the pairwise products of the entries\nof the two matrices. The determinant of the Gram matrix is the square of\nthe scalar factor by which volume of the unit ball is multiplied when\ntaking its image through\n$\\phi_\\alpha: (\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_k)\\in {\\mathbb R}^{dim E} \\mapsto \\sum_i{\\lambda_i \\alpha_i}\\in \\mathrm{End}(E,E)\\cong{\\mathbb R}^{(dim E)^2}$.\nWhen computing the discriminant of the $\\beta_i$, we look at the\nmultiplication factor introduced by the map $\\phi_\\beta$. But if $M$ is\nthe map that associates to the $\\beta_i$ their expression in terms of\nthe $\\alpha_i$ then $\\phi_\\beta=\\phi_\\alpha\\circ M$. Therefore\n$\\Delta(\\beta_i)=det(M)^2 \\Delta(\\alpha_i)$. If the\n$\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_n$ are not linearly independent then the\nmultiplication factor is $0$ (the ball is flattened), if they are\nlinearly independent det(M) is an integer (the $\\beta_i$ are linear\ncombination of the $\\alpha_i$ with integer coefficients), therefore\n$\\Delta(\\beta_i) \\ge \\Delta(\\alpha_i)$. Finally\n$\\Delta(\\beta_i)=\\Delta(\\alpha_i)$ is equivalent to $\\det(M)=1$ which in\nturn is equivalent to $M$ is invertible ($1$ is the only positive\ninvertible element of $\\mathbb Z$), which exactly means that $\\beta_i$\nis a basis $\\Delta(\\beta_i)=\\Delta(\\alpha_i)$.",
