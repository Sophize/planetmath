  "definition": "A *monic polynomial* is a polynomial with a leading coefficient of 1.\nThat is, if $P_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the variable $x$,\nthen the coefficient of $x^n$ in $P_n(x)$ is 1.\n\nFor example, $x^5+3x^3-10x^2+1$ is a monic 5th-degree polynomial.\n$3x^2+2z-5$ is a 2nd-degree polynomial which is not monic.",
