  "definition": "The smallest subfield $\\mathbb{E}$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nsuch that $\\mathbb{E}$ is Euclidean is called the *field of real\nconstructible numbers*. First, note that $\\mathbb{E}$ has the following\nproperties:\n\n1.  $0,1\\in\\mathbb{E}$;\n\n2.  If $a,b\\in\\mathbb{E}$, then also $a\\pm b$, $ab$, and\n    $a/b\\in\\mathbb{E}$, the last of which is meaningful only when\n    $b\\not=0$;\n\n3.  If $r\\in\\mathbb{E}$ and $r>0$, then $\\sqrt{r}\\in\\mathbb{E}$.\n\nThe field $\\mathbb{E}$ can be extended in a natural manner to a subfield\nof $\\mathbb{C}$ that is not a subfield of $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\mathbb{F}$\nbe a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ that has the following properties:\n\n1.  $0,1\\in\\mathbb{F}$;\n\n2.  If $a,b\\in\\mathbb{F}$, then also $a\\pm b$, $ab$, and\n    $a/b\\in\\mathbb{F}$, the last of which is meaningful only when\n    $b\\not=0$;\n\n3.  If $z\\in\\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and\n    $\\operatorname{arg}(z)=\\theta$ where $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, then\n    $\\sqrt{|z|}e^{\\frac{i\\theta}{2}}\\in\\mathbb{F}$.\n\nThen $\\mathbb{F}$ is the *field of constructible numbers*.\n\nNote that $\\mathbb{E}\\subset\\mathbb{F}$. Moreover,\n$\\mathbb{F}\\cap\\mathbb{R}=\\mathbb{E}$.\n\nAn element of $\\mathbb{F}$ is called a *constructible number*. These\nnumbers can be \u201cconstructed\u201d by a process that will be described\nshortly.\n\nConversely, let us start with a subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{C}$ such that $S$\ncontains a non-zero complex number. Call any of the binary operations in\ncondition 2 as well as the square root unary operation in condition 3 a\n*ruler and compass operation*. Call a complex number *constructible\nfrom* $S$ if it can be obtained from elements of $S$ by a finite\nsequence of ruler and compass operations. Note that $1\\in S$. If\n$S^{\\prime}$ is the set of numbers constructible from $S$ using only the\nbinary ruler and compass operations (those in condition 2), then\n$S^{\\prime}$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{C}$, and is the smallest field\ncontaining $S$. Next, denote $\\hat{S}$ the set of all constructible\nnumbers from $S$. It is not hard to see that $\\hat{S}$ is also a\nsubfield of $\\mathbb{C}$, but an extension of $S^{\\prime}$. Furthermore,\nit is not hard to show that $\\hat{S}$ is Euclidean. The general process\n(algorithm) of elements in $\\hat{S}$ from elements in $S$ using finite\nsequences of ruler and compass operations is called a ruler and compass\nconstruction. These are so called because, given two points, one of\nwhich is 0, the other of which is a non-zero real number in $S$, one can\nuse a ruler and compass to construct these elements of $\\hat{S}$.\n\nIf $S=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ (or any rational number), we see that\n$\\hat{S}=\\mathbb{F}$ is *the* field of constructible numbers.\n\nNote that the lengths of on the Euclidean plane are exactly the positive\nelements of $\\mathbb{E}$. Note also that the set $\\mathbb{F}$ is in\none-to-one correspondence with the set of on the Euclidean plane. These\nfacts provide a between abstract algebra and compass and straightedge\nconstructions.",
