  "argumentText": "The theorem is a consequence of the following lemmas, roughly\ncorresponding to the various assertions in the theorem. We assume $L/F$\nto be a finite-dimensional Galois extension of fields with Galois group\n$$G=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F).$$ The first two lemmas establish the\ncorrespondence between subgroups of $G$ and extension fields of $F$\ncontained in $L$.\n\n\\[lemma1\\] Let $K$ be an extension field of $F$ contained in $L$. Then\n$L$ is Galois over $K$, and $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$ is a subgroup of\n$G$.\n\nNote that $L/F$ is normal and separable because it is a Galois\nextension; it remains to prove that $L/K$ is also normal and separable.\nSince $L$ is normal and finite over $F$, it is the splitting field of a\npolynomial $f\\in F[X]$ over $F$. Now $L$ is also the splitting field of\n$f$ over $K$ (because $F\\subset K\\subset L$), so $L/K$ is normal.\n\nTo see that $L/K$ is also separable, suppose $\\alpha\\in L$, and let\n$f^\\alpha_F\\in F[X]$ be its minimal polynomial over $F$. Then the\nminimal polynomial $f^\\alpha_K$ of $\\alpha$ over $K$ divides\n$f^\\alpha_F$, which has no double roots in its splitting field by the\nseparability of $L/F$. Therefore $f^\\alpha_K$ has no double roots in its\nsplitting field for any $\\alpha\\in L$, so $L$ is separable over $K$.\n\nThe assertion that $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$ is a subgroup of $G$ is\nclear from the fact that $K\\supset F$.\n\n\\[lemma2\\] The function $\\phi$ from the set of extension fields of $F$\ncontained in $L$ to the set of subgroups of $G$ defined by\n$$\\phi(K)=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$$ is an inclusion-reversing bijection.\nThe inverse is given by $$\\phi^{-1}(H)=L^H,$$ where $L^H$ is the fixed\nfield of $H$ in $L$.\n\nThe definition of $\\phi$ makes sense because of Lemma \\[lemma1\\]. The\n$$\\phi^{-1}\\circ\\phi(K)=K\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\n\\phi\\circ\\phi^{-1}(H)=H$$ for all subgroups $H\\subset G$ and all fields\n$K$ with $F\\subset\nK\\subset L$ follow from the properties of the Galois group. The fixed\nfield of $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$ is precisely $K$; on the other hand,\nsince $L^H$ is the fixed field of $H$ in $L$, $H$ is the Galois group of\n$L/L^H$.\n\nFor extensions $K$ and $K'$ of $F$ with $F\\subset K\\subset K'\\subset\nL$, we have\n$$\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K')\\iff\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K),$$\nso $\\phi(K)\\supset\\phi(K')$. This shows that $\\phi$ is\ninclusion-reversing.\n\nThe following lemmas show that normal subextensions of $L/F$ are Galois\nextensions and that their Galois groups are quotient groups of $G$.\n\n\\[lemma3\\] Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then the following are\nequivalent:\n\n1.  $L^H$ is normal over $F$.\n\n2.  $\\sigma\\left(L^H\\right)=L^H$ for all $\\sigma\\in G$.\n\n3.  $\\sigma H\\sigma^{-1}=H$ for all $\\sigma\\in G$.\n\nIn particular, $L^H$ is normal over $F$ if and only if $H$ is a normal\nsubgroup of $G$.\n\n$1\\Rightarrow2$: Since for all $\\sigma\\in G$ and $\\alpha\\in L^H$,\n$\\sigma(\\alpha)$ is a zero of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over\n$F$, we have $\\sigma(\\alpha)\\in L^H$ by the of $L^H/F$.\n\n$2\\Rightarrow3$: For all $\\sigma\\in G,\\tau\\in H$ the equality\n$$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}(x)=\\sigma\\sigma^{-1}(x)=x$$ holds for all\n$x\\in L^H$ (from the assumption it follows that $\\sigma^{-1}(x)\\in L^H$,\nwhich is fixed by $\\tau$). This implies that\n$$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\in\\operatorname{Gal}(L/L^H)=H$$ for all\n$\\sigma\\in G,\\tau\\in H$.\n\n$3\\Rightarrow1$: Let $\\alpha\\in L^H$, and let $f$ be the minimal\npolynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F$. Since $L/F$ is normal, $f$ splits into\nlinear factors in $L[X]$. Suppose $\\alpha'\\in L$ is another zero of $f$,\nand let $\\sigma\\in G$ be such that $\\sigma(\\alpha')=\\alpha$ (such a\n$\\sigma$ always exists). By assumption, for all $\\tau\\in H$ we have\n$\\tau':=\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\in H$, so that\n$$\\tau(\\alpha')=\\sigma^{-1}\\tau'\\sigma(\\alpha')\n=\\sigma^{-1}\\tau'(\\alpha)=\\sigma^{-1}(\\alpha)=\\alpha'.$$ This shows that\n$\\alpha'$ lies in $L^H$ as well, so $f$ splits in $L^H[X]$. We conclude\nthat $L^H$ is normal over $F$.\n\nLet $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $L^H$ is a Galois extension of\n$F$, and the homomorphism $$\\begin{aligned}\nr\\colon G&\\to&\\operatorname{Gal}(L^H/F) \\\\\n\\sigma&\\mapsto&\\sigma\\vert_{L^H}\\end{aligned}$$ induces a natural\nidentification $$\\operatorname{Gal}(L^H/F)\\cong G/H.$$\n\nBy Lemma \\[lemma3\\], $L^H$ is normal over $F$, and because a\nsubextension of a separable extension is separable, $L^H/F$ is a Galois\nextension.\n\nThe map $r$ is well-defined by the implication $1\\Rightarrow2$ from\nLemma \\[lemma3\\]. It is surjective since every automorphism of $L^H$\nthat fixes $F$ can be extended to an automorphism of $L$ (if $L\\ne L^H$,\nfor example, we can choose an $\\alpha\\in L\\setminus L^H$ such that\n$L=L^H(\\alpha)$ using the primitive element theorem, and we can extend\n$\\sigma\\in\\operatorname{Gal}(L^H/F)$ to $L$ by putting\n$\\sigma(\\alpha)=\\alpha$). The kernel of $r$ is clearly equal to $H$, so\nthe first isomorphism theorem gives the claimed identification.",
