Then for all natural numbers $n$ we can find\nsome $x_n \\in [a,b]$ such that $|f(x_n)|>n$. The sequence $(x_n)$ is\nbounded, so by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem it has a convergent sub\nsequence, say $(x_{n_i})$. As $[a,b]$ is closed $(x_{n_i})$ converges to\na value in $[a,b]$. By the continuity of $f$ we should have that\n$f(x_{n_i})$ converges, but by construction it diverges. This\ncontradiction finishes the proof.",
