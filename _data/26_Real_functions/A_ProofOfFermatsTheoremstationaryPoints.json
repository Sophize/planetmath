  "argumentText": "Suppose that $x_0$ is a local maximum (a similar proof applies if $x_0$\nis a local minimum). Then there exists $\\delta>0$ such that\n$(x_0-\\delta,x_0+\\delta)\\subset (a,b)$ and such that we have\n$f(x_0)\\ge f(x)$ for all $x$ with $\\vert x-x_0\\vert <\\delta$. Hence for\n$h\\in (0,\\delta)$ we notice that it holds\n$$\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\le 0.$$ Since the limit of this ratio as\n$h\\to 0^+$ exists and is equal to $f'(x_0)$ we conclude that\n$f'(x_0)\\le 0$. On the other hand for $h\\in (-\\delta,0)$ we notice that\n$$\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h} \\ge 0$$ but again the limit as $h\\to 0^+$\nexists and is equal to $f'(x_0)$ so we also have $f'(x_0)\\ge 0$.\n\nHence we conclude that $f'(x_0)=0$.\n\nTo prove the second part of the statement (when $x_0$ is equal to $a$ or\n$b$), just notice that in such points we have only one of the two\nestimates written above.",
