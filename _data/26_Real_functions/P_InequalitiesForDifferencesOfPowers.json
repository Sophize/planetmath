  "statement": "Oftentimes, one needs to estimate differences of powers of real numbers.\nThe following inequalities are useful for this purpose:\n$$n (u-v) v^{n-1} < u^n - v^n < n (u-v) u^{n-1}$$\n$$n x \\le (1 + x)^n - 1$$\n$$(1 + x)^n - 1 \\le { n x \\over 1 - (n - 1) x}$$\n\nHere $n$ is an integer greater than 1. The first inequality holds when\n$0 < v < u$, the second inequality holds when $-1 < x $, and the third\ninequality holds when $-1 < x < 1/(n-1)$. Equality can only occur in the\nlatter two inequalities when $x = 0$.",
