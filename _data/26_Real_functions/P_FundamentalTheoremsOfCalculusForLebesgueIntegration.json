  "statement": "Loosely, the *Fundamental Theorems of Calculus* serve to demonstrate\nthat integration and differentiation are inverse processes. Suppose that\n$F(x)$ is an absolutely continuous function on an interval\n$[a,b]\\subset\\mathbb{R}$. The two following forms of the theorem are\nequivalent.\n\n[**First form of the Fundamental Theorem:**]{}\n\nThere exists a function $f(t)$ Lebesgue-integrable on $[a,b]$ such that\nfor any $x\\in [a,b]$, we have $F(x)-F(a)=\\int_a^x f(t) dt$.\n\n[**Second form of the Fundamental Theorem:**]{}\n\n$F(x)$ is differentiable almost everywhere on $[a,b]$ and its\nderivative, denoted $F'(x)$, is Lebesgue-integrable on that interval. In\naddition, we have the relation $F(x)-F(a)=\\int_a^x F'(t)dt$ for any\n$x\\in [a,b]$.",
