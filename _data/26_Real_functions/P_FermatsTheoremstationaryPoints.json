If $f$ is differentiable\nin $x_0$ then $f'(x_0)=0$.\n\nMoreover if $f$ has a local maximum at $a$ and $f$ is differentiable at\n$a$ (the right derivative exists) then $f'(a)\\le 0$; if $f$ has a local\nminimum at $a$ then $f'(a)\\ge 0$. If $f$ is differentiable in $b$ and\nhas a local maximum at $b$ then $f'(b)\\ge 0$ while if it has a local\nminimum at $b$ then $f'(b)\\le 0$.",
