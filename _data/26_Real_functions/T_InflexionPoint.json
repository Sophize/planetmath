  "definition": "In examining the graphs of differentiable real functions, it may be\nuseful to the intervals where the function is and the ones where it is .\n\n-   A function $f$ is said to be if the of $f$ to this interval is a\n    (strictly) convex function; this may be characterized more\n    illustratively by saying that the graph of $f$ is or . On such an\n    interval, the tangent line of the graph is constantly turning\n    counterclockwise, , the derivative $f'$ is increasing and thus the\n    second derivative $f''$ is positive. In the picture below, the sine\n    curve is concave up on the interval $(-\\pi,\\,0)$.\n\n-   The [*concavity*]{} of the function $f$ on an interval\n    correspondingly: On such an interval, the graph of $f$ is or , the\n    tangent line turns clockwise, $f'$ decreases, and $f''$ is negative.\n    In the picture below, the sine curve is concave down on the interval\n    $(0,\\,\\pi)$.\n\n-   The points in which a function changes from or vice versa are the\n    [*inflexion points*]{} (or *inflection points*) of the graph of the\n    function. At an inflexion point, the tangent line crosses the curve,\n    the second derivative vanishes and changes its sign when one passes\n    through the point.\n\n-   A graph may have points where the second derivative vanishes but\n    does not change its sign when passed such a point; thus the first\n    derivative is here changing \u201cvery slowly\u201d. Such a point is sometimes\n    called an [*undulation point*]{}. The graph of $x\\mapsto x^4$ has\n    the origin as an undulation point.\n\n(-5,-2.5)(5,2) (0,0)(-4.5,-1.5)(5,2) (5,-0.2)[$x$]{} (0.2,2)[$y$]{}\n(3,-0.2)[$\\pi$]{} (-3.1,-0.2)[$-\\pi$]{} (0,0) (0.2,-2.3)[The origin is\nan inflexion point of the sinusoid $y = \\sin{x}$.]{}\n\nSince the sine function is $2\\pi$-periodic, the sinusoid possesses\ninfinitely many inflexion points.

For finding the inflexion points of the graph of $f$ it does not\nsuffice to find the of the equation $f''(x) = 0$, since the sign of\n$f''$ does not necessarily change as one passes such a . If the second\nderivative maintains its sign when one of its zeros is passed, we can\nspeak of a [*plain point*]{} (?) of the graph. E.g. the origin is a\nplain point of the graph of $x\\mapsto x^4$.\n\n2\\. Recalling that the $\\kappa$ for a plane curve $y = f(x)$ is given by\n$$\\kappa(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{f''(x)}{[1+f'(x)^2]^{3/2}},$$ we can say that\nthe inflexion points are the points of the curve where the curvature\nchanges its sign and where the curvature equals zero.\n\n3\\. If an inflexion point $x = \\xi$ satisfies the additional condition\n$f'(\\xi) = 0$, the point is said to be a or a [*saddle-point*]{}, while\nin the case $f'(\\xi) \\neq 0$ it is a [*non-stationary inflexion\npoint*]{}.",
