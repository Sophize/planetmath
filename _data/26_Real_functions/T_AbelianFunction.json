  "definition": "An abelian or hyperelliptic function is a generalisation of an elliptic\nfunction. It is a function of two variables with four periods. In a\nsimilar way to an elliptic function it can also be regarded as the\ninverse function to certain integrals (called abelian or hyperelliptic\nintegrals) of the form $$\\int\\frac{dz}{R(z)}$$ where $R$ is a polynomial\nof degree greater than 4.",
