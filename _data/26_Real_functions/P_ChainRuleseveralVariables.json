  "statement": "The chain rule is a theorem of analysis that governs derivatives of\ncomposed functions. The basic theorem is the chain rule for functions of\none variables (). This entry is devoted to the more general version\ninvolving functions of several variables and partial derivatives. Note:\nthe symbol $D_k$ will be used to denote the partial derivative with\nrespect to the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ variable.\n\nLet $F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ and\n$G_1(x_1,\\ldots,x_m),\\ldots,G_n(x_1,\\ldots,x_m)$ be differentiable\nfunctions of several variables, and let $$H(x_1,\\ldots,x_m) =\nF(G_1(x_1,\\ldots,x_m),\\ldots,G_n(x_1,\\ldots,x_m))$$ be the function\ndetermined by the composition of $F$ with $G_1,\\ldots,G_n$ The partial\nderivatives of $H$ are given by\n$$(D_k H)(x_1,\\ldots,x_m) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (D_i\nF)(G_1(x_1,\\ldots,x_m),\\ldots) (D_k G_i)(x_1,\\ldots,x_m).$$\n\nThe chain rule can be more compactly (albeit less precisely) expressed\nin terms of the Jacobi-Legendre partial derivative symbols (). Just as\nin the Leibniz system, the basic idea is that of one quantity (i.e.\nvariable) depending on one or more other quantities. Thus we would speak\nabout a variable $z$ depends differentiably on $y_1,\\ldots,y_n$, which\nin turn depend differentiably on variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_m$. We would\nthen write the chain rule as\n$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial\n  z}{\\partial y_i} \\frac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial x_j},\\qquad j=1,\\ldots\nm.$$\n\nThe most general, and conceptually clear approach to the multi-variable\nchain is based on the notion of a differentiable mapping, with the\nJacobian matrix of partial derivatives playing the role of generalized\nderivative. Let, $X\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^m$ and $Y\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^n$\nbe open domains and let\n$${\\mathbf{F}}:Y\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{R}}^l,\\qquad {\\mathbf{G}}:X\\rightarrow Y$$\nbe differentiable mappings. In essence, the symbol ${\\mathbf{F}}$\nrepresents $l$ functions of $n$ variables each:\n$${\\mathbf{F}}= (F_1,\\ldots,F_l),\\qquad F_i=F_i(x_1,\\ldots,x_n),$$\nwhereas ${\\mathbf{G}}=(G_1,\\ldots,G_n)$ represents $n$ functions of $m$\nvariables each. The derivative of such mappings is no longer a function,\nbut rather a matrix of partial derivatives, customarily called the\nJacobian matrix. Thus $$D{\\mathbf{F}}= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  D_1 F_1 & \\ldots & D_n F_1 \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  D_1 F_l & \\ldots & D_n F_l\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\qquad\nD{\\mathbf{G}}= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  D_1 G_1 & \\ldots & D_m G_1 \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  D_1 G_n & \\ldots & D_m G_n\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ The chain rule now takes the same form as it did for\nfunctions of one variable:\n$$D({\\mathbf{F}}\\circ {\\mathbf{G}}) = ((D{\\mathbf{F}}) \\circ {\\mathbf{G}})\\, (D{\\mathbf{G}}),$$\nalbeit with matrix multiplication taking the place of ordinary\nmultiplication.\n\nThis form of the chain rule also generalizes quite nicely to the even\nmore general setting where one is interested in describing the\nderivative of a composition of mappings between manifolds.",
