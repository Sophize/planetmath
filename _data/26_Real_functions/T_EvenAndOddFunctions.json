If\n$f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}$, then $f$ is an *even\nfunction*. Similarly, if $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}$, then\n$f$ is an *odd function*.\n\nAlthough this entry is mainly concerned with functions\n${\\mathbb{R}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$, the definition can be generalized to\nother types of function.\n\nNotes {#notes .unnumbered}\n=====\n\nA real function is even if and only if it is symmetric about the\n$y$-axis. It is odd if and only if symmetric about the origin.\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n========\n\n1.  The function $f(x)=x$ is odd.\n\n2.  The function $f(x)=|x|$ is even.\n\n3.  The sine and cosine functions are odd and even, respectively.\n\nProperties {#properties .unnumbered}\n==========\n\n1.  The only function that is both even and odd is the function defined\n    by $f(x)=0$ for all real $x$.\n\n2.  A sum of even functions is even, and a sum of odd functions is odd.\n    In fact, the even functions form a real vector space, as do the odd\n    functions.\n\n3.  Every real function can be expressed in a unique way as the sum of\n    an odd function and an even function.\n\n4.  From the above it follows that the vector space of real functions is\n    the direct sum of the vector space of even functions and the vector\n    space of odd functions. See the entry .)\n\n5.  Let $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function.\n\n    1.  If $f$ is an even function, then the derivative $f'$ is an odd\n        function.\n\n    2.  If $f$ is an odd function, then the derivative $f'$ is an even\n        function.\n\n    (For a proof, see the entry .)\n\n6.  Let $f\\colon{\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be a smooth function. Then\n    there exist smooth functions $g,h\\colon{\\mathbb{R}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$\n    such that $$f(x) = g(x^2)+ xh(x^2)$$ for all $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}$.\n    Thus, if $f$ is even, we have $f(x)=g(x^2)$, and if $f$ is odd, we\n    have $f(x)=xh(x^2)$. ([@hormander], Exercise 1.2)\n\n7.  The Fourier transform of a real even function is purely real and\n    even. The Fourier transform of a real odd function is purely\n    imaginary and odd.\n\n[9]{} L.
