  "definition": "A [*normal line*]{} (or simply [*normal*]{} or [*perpendicular*]{}) of a\ncurve at one of its points $P$ is the line passing through this point\nand perpendicular to the tangent line of the curve at $P$. The point $P$\nis the [*foot*]{} of the normal.\n\nIf the plane curve $y = f(x)$ has a skew tangent at the point\n$(x_0,\\,f(x_0))$, then the slope of the tangent at that point is\n$f'(x_0)$ and the slope of the normal at that point is\n$\\displaystyle -\\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}$. The equation of the normal is thus\n$$y-f(x_0) = -\\frac{1}{f'(x_0)}(x-x_0).$$ In the case that the tangent\nis horizontal, the equation of the vertical normal is $$x = x_0,$$ and\nin the case that the tangent is vertical, the equation of the normal is\n$$y = f(x_0).$$\n\nThe normal of a curve at its point $P$ always goes through the center of\ncurvature belonging to the point $P$.\n\nIn the picture below, the black curve is a parabola, the red line is the\ntangent at the point $P$, and the blue line is the normal at the point\n$P$.\n\n(-2,-1)(2,4) (2,4)(0,0) (-2,4)[.]{} (2,4)[.]{} (-0.05,-1)[.]{}\n(0,-1)(2,3) (-2,2.5)(2,0.5) (1,1) (0.9,1.2)[$P$]{} (0.9,0.8)(1.1,0.7)\n(1.1,0.7)(1.2,0.9)",
