  "statement": "Let $X$ be a measure space, and let $0\\leq f_1\\leq f_2\\leq\\cdots$ be a\nmonotone increasing sequence of nonnegative measurable functions. Let\n$f\\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ be the function defined by\n$f(x) = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} f_n(x)$. Then $f$ is measurable, and\n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\int_X f_n = \\int_X f.$$\n\n**Remark.** This theorem is the first of several theorems which allow us\nto \u201cexchange integration and limits\u201d. It requires the use of the\nLebesgue integral: with the Riemann integral, we cannot even formulate\nthe theorem, lacking, as we do, the concept of \u201calmost everywhere\u201d. For\ninstance, the characteristic function of the rational numbers in $[0,1]$\nis not Riemann integrable, despite being the limit of an increasing\nsequence of Riemann integrable functions.",
