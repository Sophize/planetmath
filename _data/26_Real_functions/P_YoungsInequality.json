  "statement": "Let $\\phi : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous ,\nstrictly increasing function such that $\\phi(0)=0$ . Then the following\ninequality holds:\n$$ab \\leq \\int_{0}^a \\phi(x) dx + \\int_{0}^b \\phi^{-1}(y) dy$$ Equality\nonly holds when $b = \\phi(a)$. This inequality can be demonstrated by\ndrawing the graph of $\\phi(x)$ and by observing that the sum of the two\nareas represented by the integrals above is greater than the area of a\nrectangle of sides $a$ and $b$, as is illustrated in .",
