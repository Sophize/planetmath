  "definition": "*Torricelli\u2019s trumpet* is a fictional infinitely long solid of\nrevolution formed when the closed domain\n$$A := \\{(x,\\,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\vdots\\;\\; x \\ge 1,\\; 0 \\le y \\le \\frac{1}{x}\\}$$\nrotates about the $x$-axis. It has a finite volume, $\\pi$ volume , but\nthe area of its surface is infinite; in fact even the area of $A$ is\ninfinite, i.e., the improper integral\n$\\displaystyle\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx$ is not convergent.\n\nTorricelli\u2019s trumpet is surprising since it can be filled by a finite\namount of paint, but this paint can never suffice for painting its\nsurface, no matter how a coat of paint is used!",
