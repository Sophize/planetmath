  "definition": "The purpose of Dedekind cuts is to provide a sound logical foundation\nfor the real number system. Dedekind\u2019s motivation behind this project is\nto notice that a real number $\\alpha$, intuitively, is completely\ndetermined by the rationals strictly smaller than $\\alpha$ and those\nstrictly larger than $\\alpha$. Concerning the completeness or continuity\nof the real line, Dedekind notes in [@Dedekind] that\n\n> If all points of the straight line fall into two classes such that\n> every point of the first class lies to the left of every point of the\n> second class, then there exists one and only one point which produces\n> this division of all points into two classes, this severing of the\n> straight line into two portions.\n\nDedekind defines a point to produce the division of the real line if\nthis point is either the least or greatest element of either one of the\nclasses mentioned above. He further notes that the completeness\nproperty, as he just phrased it, is deficient in the rationals, which\nmotivates the definition of reals as cuts of rationals. Because all\nrationals greater than $\\alpha$ are really just excess baggage, we\nprefer to sway somewhat from Dedekind\u2019s original definition. Instead, we\nadopt the following definition.\n\nA *Dedekind cut* is a subset $\\alpha$ of the rational numbers\n${\\mathbb{Q}}$ that satisfies these properties:\n\n1.  $\\alpha$ is not empty.\n\n2.  $\\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\alpha$ is not empty.\n\n3.  $\\alpha$ contains no greatest element\n\n4.  For $x, y \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}$, if $x \\in \\alpha$ and $y < x$, then\n    $y \\in \\alpha$ as well.\n\nDedekind cuts are particularly appealing for two reasons. First, they\nmake it very easy to prove the completeness, or continuity of the real\nline. Also, they make it quite plain to distinguish the rationals from\nthe irrationals on the real line, and put the latter on a firm logical\nfoundation. In the construction of the real numbers from Dedekind cuts,\nwe make the following definition:\n\nA *real number* is a Dedekind cut. We denote the set of all real numbers\nby ${\\mathbb{R}}$ and we order them by set-theoretic inclusion, that is\nto say, for any $\\alpha, \\beta \\in {\\mathbb{R}}$,\n$$\\alpha < \\beta \\mbox{ if and only if } \\alpha \\subset \\beta$$ where\nthe inclusion is strict. We further define $\\alpha = \\beta$ as real\nnumbers if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are equal as sets. As usual, we write\n$\\alpha \\leq \\beta$ if $\\alpha < \\beta$ or $\\alpha=\\beta$. Moreover, a\nreal number $\\alpha$ is said to be *irrational* if\n${\\mathbb{Q}}\\setminus \\alpha$ contains no least element.\n\nThe Dedekind completeness property of real numbers, expressed as the\nsupremum property, now becomes straightforward to prove. In what\nfollows, we will reserve Greek variables for real numbers, and Roman\nvariables for rationals.\n\nEvery nonempty subset of real numbers that is bounded above has a least\nupper bound.\n\nLet $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers, such that for every\n$\\alpha \\in A$ we have that $\\alpha \\leq \\gamma$ for some real number\n$\\gamma$. Now define the set\n\n$$\\sup A =  \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in A} \\alpha.$$\n\nWe must show that this set is a real number. This amounts to checking\nthe four conditions of a Dedekind cut.\n\n1.  $\\sup A$ is clearly not empty, for it is the nonempty union of\n    nonempty sets.\n\n2.  Because $\\gamma$ is a real number, there is some rational $x$ that\n    is not in $\\gamma$. Since every $\\alpha \\in A$ is a subset of\n    $\\gamma$, $x$ is not in any $\\alpha$, so $x \\not\\in \\sup A$ either.\n    Thus, ${\\mathbb{Q}}\\setminus \\sup A$ is nonempty.\n\n3.  If $\\sup A$ had a greatest element $g$, then $g \\in \\alpha$ for some\n    $\\alpha \\in A$. Then $g$ would be a greatest element of $\\alpha$,\n    but $\\alpha$ is a real number, so by contrapositive, $\\sup A$ has no\n    greatest element.\n\n4.  Lastly, if $x \\in \\sup A$, then $x \\in \\alpha$ for some $\\alpha$, so\n    given any $y < x$ because $\\alpha$ is a real number $y \\in \\alpha$,\n    whence $y \\in \\sup A$.\n\nThus, $\\sup A$ is a real number. Trivially, $\\sup A$ is an upper bound\nof $A$, for every $\\alpha \\subseteq \\sup A$. It now suffices to prove\nthat $\\sup A \\leq \\gamma$, because $\\gamma$ was an arbitrary upper\nbound. But this is easy, because every $x \\in \\sup A$ is an element of\n$\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\in A$, so because $\\alpha \\subseteq \\gamma$,\n$x \\in \\gamma$. Thus, $\\sup A$ is the least upper bound of $A$. We call\nthis real number the *supremum* of A.\n\nTo finish the construction of the real numbers, we must endow them with\nalgebraic operations, define the additive and multiplicative identity\nelements, prove that these definitions give a field, and prove further\nresults about the order of the reals (such as the totality of this\norder) \u2013 in short, build a complete ordered field. This task is somewhat\nlaborious, but we include here the appropriate definitions. Verifying\ntheir correctness can be an instructive, albeit tiresome, exercise. We\nuse the same symbols for the operations on the reals as for the rational\nnumbers; this should cause no confusion in context.\n\nGiven two real numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, we define\n\n-   The *additive identity*, denoted $0$, is\n    $$0 := \\{ x \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}: x < 0 \\}$$\n\n-   The *multiplicative identity*, denoted $1$, is\n    $$1 := \\{x \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}: x < 1 \\}$$\n\n-   *Addition* of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denoted $\\alpha + \\beta$ is\n    $$\\alpha + \\beta := \\{x + y : x \\in \\alpha, ~y \\in \\beta \\}$$\n\n-   The *opposite* of $\\alpha$, denoted $-\\alpha$, is\n    $$-\\alpha := \\{x \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}: -x \\not\\in \\alpha, \\mbox{ but } -x \\mbox{ is not the least element of }\n        {\\mathbb{Q}}\\setminus \\alpha \\}$$\n\n-   The *absolute value* of $\\alpha$, denoted $|\\alpha|$, is\n    $$|\\alpha| :=\n     \\begin{cases}\n       \\alpha, &\\text{if } ~\\alpha \\geq 0 \\\\\n      -\\alpha, &\\text{if } ~\\alpha \\leq 0\n     \\end{cases}$$\n\n-   If $\\alpha, \\beta > 0$, then *multiplication* of $\\alpha$ and\n    $\\beta$, denoted $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$, is\n    $$\\alpha \\cdot \\beta := \\{z \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}: z \\leq 0 \\mbox{ or } z = xy \\mbox{ for some } x \\in \\alpha, ~y \\in \\beta \n                   \\mbox{ with } x, y > 0 \\}$$ In general,\n    $$\\alpha \\cdot \\beta :=\n      \\begin{cases}\n        0,                    &\\text{if } ~\\alpha = 0  \\text{ or } ~\\beta = 0 \\\\\n        |\\alpha|\\cdot|\\beta|  &\\text{if } ~\\alpha > 0, ~\\beta > 0 \\text { or } ~\\alpha < 0, ~\\beta < 0 \\\\\n        -(|\\alpha|\\cdot|\\beta|) &\\text{if } ~\\alpha > 0, ~\\beta < 0 \\text { or } ~\\alpha > 0, ~\\beta < 0\n       \\end{cases}$$\n\n-   The *inverse* of $\\alpha > 0$, denoted $\\alpha^{-1}$, is\n    $$\\alpha^{-1} := \\{x \\in {\\mathbb{Q}}: x \\leq 0 \\text{ or } x > 0 \\text{ and } (1/x) \\not\\in \\alpha, \\text{ but }\n                    1/x \\text{ is not the least element of } {\\mathbb{Q}}\\setminus \\alpha \\}$$\n    If $\\alpha < 0$, $$\\alpha^{-1} :=  -(|\\alpha|)^{-1}$$\n\nAll that remains (!) is to check that the above definitions do indeed\ndefine a complete ordered field, and that all the sets implied to be\nreal numbers are indeed so. The properties of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ as an\nordered field follow from these definitions and the properties of\n${\\mathbb{Q}}$ as an ordered field. It is important to point out that in\ntwo steps, in showing that inverses and opposites are properly defined,\nwe require an extra property of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, not merely in its\ncapacity as an ordered field. This requirement is the Archimedean\nproperty.\n\nMoreover, because ${\\mathbb{R}}$ is a field of characteristic $0$, it\ncontains an isomorphic copy of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$. The rationals correspond\nto the Dedekind cuts $\\alpha$ for which ${\\mathbb{Q}}\\setminus \\alpha$\ncontains a least member.\n\n[99]{} Courant, Richard and Robbins, Herbert.
