  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nSuppose $A$ is an open set in ${\\mathbb{R}}$ (say an interval $A=(a,b)$,\nor $A={\\mathbb{R}}$), and $f:A\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ is a function. Then $f$\nis *discontinuous* at $x\\in A$, if $f$ is not continuous at $x$. One\nalso says that $f$ is discontinuous at all boundary points of $A$.\n\nWe know that $f$ is continuous at $x$ if and only if\n$\\lim_{z\\to x} f(z)=f(x)$. Thus, from the properties of the one-sided\nlimits, which we denote by $f(x+)$ and $f(x-)$, it follows that $f$ is\ndiscontinuous at $x$ if and only if $f(x+)\\neq f(x)$, or\n$f(x-)\\neq f(x)$.\n\nIf $f$ is discontinuous at $x\\in\\overline{A}$, the closure of $A$, we\ncan then distinguish four types of different discontinuities as follows\n[@hoskins; @contline]:\n\n1.  If $f(x+)=f(x-)$, but $f(x)\\neq f(x\\pm)$, then $x$ is called a\n    *removable discontinuity* of $f$. If we modify the value of $f$ at\n    $x$ to $f(x)=f(x\\pm)$, then $f$ will become continuous at $x$. This\n    is clear since the modified $f$ (call it $f_0$) satisfies\n    $f_0(x) = f_0(x+)=f_0(x-).$\n\n2.  If $f(x+)=f(x-)$, but $x$ is not in $A$ (so $f(x)$ is not defined),\n    then $x$ is also called a *removable discontinuity*. If we assign\n    $f(x)=f(x\\pm)$, then this modification renders $f$ continuous at\n    $x$.\n\n3.  If $f(x-)\\neq f(x+)$, then $f$ has a *jump discontinuity* at $x$\n    Then the number $f(x+)-f(x-)$ is then called the *jump*, or\n    *saltus*, of $f$ at $x$.\n\n4.  If either (or both) of $f(x+)$ or $f(x-)$ does not exist, then $f$\n    has an *essential discontinuity* at $x$ (or a *discontinuity of the\n    second kind*).\n\nNote that $f$ may be continuous (continuous in all points in $A$), but\nstill have discontinuities in $\\overline{A}$\n\n Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n=========\n\n1.  Consider the function $f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ given by\n    $$f(x)=\\begin{cases} \n     1 & \\text{when }x\\neq 0, \\\\\n     0 & \\text{when }x=0.  \n    \\end{cases}$$ Since $f(0-)=1$, $f(0)=0$, and $f(0+)=1$, it follows\n    that $f$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=0$. If we modify $f(0)$\n    so that $f(0)=1$, then $f$ becomes the continuous function $f(x)=1$.\n\n2.  Let us consider the function defined by the formula\n    $$f(x) = \\frac{\\sin x }{x}$$ where $x$ is a nonzero real number.\n    When $x=0$, the formula is undefined, so $f$ is only determined for\n    $x\\neq 0$. Let us show that this point is a removable discontinuity.\n    Indeed, it is easy to see that $f$ is continuous for all $x\\neq 0$,\n    and using we have $f(0+)=f(0-)=1$. Thus, if we assign $f(0)=1$, then\n    $f$ becomes a continuous function defined for all real $x$. In fact,\n    $f$ can be made into an analytic function on the whole complex\n    plane.\n\n3.  The signum function\n    ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}\\colon{\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ is\n    defined as $${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(x) =\\begin{cases} \n     -1 & \\text{when }x<0, \\\\\n     0 & \\text{when } x=0, \\text{ and}\\\\\n     1 & \\text{when } x>0. \n    \\end{cases}$$ Since ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(0+)=1$,\n    ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(0)=0$, and since\n    ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(0-)=-1$, it follows that\n    ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}$ has a jump discontinuity at $x=0$ with\n    jump ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(0+)-{\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(0-)=2$.\n\n4.  The function $f:{\\mathbb{R}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$ given by\n    $$f(x) =\\begin{cases}\n     1 & \\text{when }x= 0, \\\\\n     \\sin(1/x) & \\text{when } x\\neq 0\n    \\end{cases}$$ has an essential discontinuity at $x=0$. See\n    [@contline] for details.\n\nGeneral Definition {#general-definition .unnumbered}\n==================\n\nLet $X,Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f$ be a mapping $f:X\\to Y$.\nThen $f$ is *discontinuous* at $x\\in X$, if $f$ is not $x$.\n\nIn this generality, one generally does not classify discontinuities\nquite so closely, since they can have quite complicated behaviour.\n\nNotes {#notes .unnumbered}\n=====\n\nA jump discontinuity is also called a *simple discontinuity*, or a\n*discontinuity of the first kind*. An *essential discontinuity* is also\ncalled a *discontinuity of the second kind*.\n\n[9]{} R.F.
