  "definition": "#### Basic Definition.\n\nLet $x,y,z$ be a system of Cartesian coordinates on $3$-dimensional\nEuclidean space, and let ${\\mathbf{i}}, {\\mathbf{j}}, {\\mathbf{k}}$ be\nthe corresponding basis of unit vectors. The *divergence* of a\ncontinuously differentiable vector field\n$${\\mathbf{F}}= F^1{\\mathbf{i}}+F^2{\\mathbf{j}}+F^3{\\mathbf{k}},$$ is\ndefined to be the function $${\\operatorname{div}}{\\mathbf{F}}=\n\\frac{\\partial F^1}{\\partial x}+\n\\frac{\\partial F^2}{\\partial y}+\n\\frac{\\partial F^3}{\\partial z}.$$ Another common notation for the\ndivergence is ${\\nabla}\\cdot{\\mathbf{F}}$ (see gradient), a convenient\nmnemonic.\n\n#### Physical interpretation.\n\nIn physical , the divergence of a vector field is the extent to which\nthe vector field flow behaves like a source or a sink at a given point.\nIndeed, an alternative, but logically equivalent definition, gives the\ndivergence as the derivative of the net flow of the vector field across\nthe surface of a small sphere relative to the surface area of the\nsphere. To wit,\n$$({\\operatorname{div}}{\\mathbf{F}})(p)= \\lim_{r\\rightarrow 0}\n\\int_{S} \\!\\!({\\mathbf{F}}\\cdot {\\mathbf{N}})dS\\;/\\left(4 \\pi r^2\\right),$$\nwhere $S$ denotes the sphere of radius $r$ about a point\n$p\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^3$, and the integral is a surface integral taken with\nrespect to ${\\mathbf{N}}$, the normal to that sphere.\n\nThe non-infinitesimal interpretation of divergence is given by Gauss\u2019s\nTheorem. This theorem is a conservation law, stating that the volume\ntotal of all sinks and sources, i.e. the volume integral of the\ndivergence, is equal to the net flow across the volume\u2019s boundary. In\nsymbols,\n$$\\int_V {\\operatorname{div}}{\\mathbf{F}}\\, dV = \\int_S ({\\mathbf{F}}\\cdot {\\mathbf{N}})\\, dS,$$\nwhere $V\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^3$ is a compact region with a smooth\nboundary, and $S=\\partial V$ is that boundary oriented by\noutward-pointing normals. We note that Gauss\u2019s theorem follows from the\nmore general Stokes\u2019 Theorem, which itself generalizes the fundamental\ntheorem of calculus.\n\nIn light of the physical interpretation, a vector field with constant\nzero divergence is called *incompressible* \u2013 in this case, no flow can\noccur across any surface.\n\n#### General definition.\n\nThe notion of divergence has meaning in the more general setting of\nRiemannian geometry. To that end, let ${\\mathbf{V}}$ be a vector field\non a Riemannian manifold. The covariant derivative of ${\\mathbf{V}}$ is\na type $(1,1)$ tensor field. We define the *divergence* of\n${\\mathbf{V}}$ to be the trace of that field. In terms of coordinates\n(see tensor and Einstein summation convention), we have\n$${\\operatorname{div}}{\\mathbf{V}}= V^i{}_{;i} \\ .$$",
