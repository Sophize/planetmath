  "definition": "Qualitatively the [*derivative*]{} is a of the change of a function in a\nsmall around a specified point.\n\nMotivation {#motivation .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nThe idea behind the derivative comes from the straight line. What\ncharacterizes a straight line is the fact that it has constant \u201cslope\u201d.\n\nIn other words, for a line given by the equation $y=mx+b$, as in Fig.\n\\[line\\], the ratio of $\\Delta y$ over $\\Delta x$ is always constant and\nhas the value $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = m$.\n\nFor other curves we cannot define a \u201cslope\u201d, like for the straight line,\nsince such a quantity would not be constant. However, for sufficiently\nsmooth curves, each point on a curve has a tangent line. For example\nconsider the curve $y=x^2$, as in Fig. \\[parabola\\]. At the point\n$(x_0,y_0)$ on the curve, we can draw a tangent of slope $m$ given by\nthe equation $y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$.\n\nSuppose we have a curve of the form $y=f(x)$, and at the point\n$(x_0,f(x_0))$ we have a tangent given by $y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$. Note that\nfor values of $x$ sufficiently close to $x_0$ we can make the\napproximation $f(x)\\approx m(x-x_0)+y_0$. So the slope $m$ of the\ntangent describes how much $f(x)$ changes in the vicinity of $x_0$. It\nis the slope of the tangent that will be associated with the derivative\nof the function $f(x)$.\n\nFormal definition {#formal-definition .unnumbered}\n=================\n\nMore formally for any real function $f\\colon\\R\\to\\R$, we define the\n[*derivative*]{} of $f$ at the point $x$ as the following limit (if it\nexists) $$f'(x) := \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ This\ndefinition turns out to be with the motivation introduced above.\n\nThe derivatives for some elementary functions are (cf. derivative\nnotation)\n\n1.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} c = 0$, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where $c$ is constant;\n\n2.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}$;\n\n3.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} \\sin x = \\cos x$;\n\n4.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos x = -\\sin x$;\n\n5.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$;\n\n6.  $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln x = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nWhile derivatives of more complicated expressions can be calculated\nalgorithmically using the following rules\n\nLinearity\n\n:   $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(af(x)+bg(x)\\right) = af'(x)+bg'(x)$;\n\nProduct rule\n\n:   $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(f(x)g(x)\\right)\n            = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$;\n\nChain rule\n\n:   $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx}g(f(x)) = g'(f(x))f'(x)$;\n\nQuotient Rule\n\n:   $\\displaystyle \\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \n            \\frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$.\n\nNote that the quotient rule, although given as much importance as the\nother rules in elementary calculus, can be derived by succesively\napplying the product rule and the chain rule to\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=f(x)\\frac{1}{g(x)}$. Also the quotient\nrule does not generalize as well as the other ones.\n\nSince the derivative $f'(x)$ of $f(x)$ is also a function $x$, higher\nderivatives can be obtained by applying the same procedure to $f'(x)$\nand so on.\n\nGeneralization {#generalization .unnumbered}\n==============\n\nBanach Spaces {#banach-spaces .unnumbered}\n-------------\n\nUnfortunately the notion of the \u201cslope of the tangent\u201d does not directly\ngeneralize to more abstract situations. What we can do is keep in mind\nthe facts that the tangent is a linear function and that it approximates\nthe function near the point of tangency, as well as the formal\ndefinition above.\n\nVery general conditions under which we can define a derivative in a\nmanner much similar to the above areas follows. Let $f\\colon\\V\\to\\W$,\nwhere $\\V$ and $\\W$ are Banach spaces. Let $\\h\\ne 0$ be an element of\n$\\V$. We define the *directional derivative* $(D_\\h f)(\\x)$ at $\\x$ as\nthe following limit (when it exists):\n$$(D_\\h f)(\\x) := \\lim_{\\eps\\to0} \\frac{f(\\x+\\eps\\h)-f(\\x)}{\\eps},$$\nwhere $\\eps$ is a scalar. Note that $f(x+\\eps\\h)\\approx f(\\x) +\n    \\eps(D_\\h f)(\\x)$, which is with our original motivation. In certain\ncontexts, this directional derivative is also called the *G\u00e2teaux\nderivative*.\n\nFinally we define the [*derivative*]{} at $\\x$ as the bounded linear map\n$(Df)(\\x)\\colon\\V\\to\\W$ such that for any non-zero $\\h\\in\\V$\n$$\\lim_{\\|\\h\\|\\to0} \\frac{(f(\\x+\\h)-f(\\x))-(Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h}{\\|\\h\\|}=0.$$\nOnce again we have $f(\\x+\\h)\\approx f(\\x)+(Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h$. In fact, if\nthe derivative $(Df)(\\x)$ exists, the directional derivatives can be\nobtained as $(D_\\h f)(\\x) = (Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h$. [^1] However, the\nexistence of $(D_\\h f)$ for each non-zero $\\h\\in\\V$ does not guarantee\nthe existence of $(Df)(\\x)$. This derivative is also called the *Fr\u00e9chet\nderivative*. In the more familiar case $f\\colon\\R^n\\to\\R^m$, the\nderivative $Df$ is simply the Jacobian of $f$.\n\nUnder these general conditions the following properties of the\nderivative remain\n\n1.  $D\\h = 0$, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where $\\h$ is a constant;\n\n2.  $D(A\\cdot\\x) = A$, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where $A$ is linear.\n\nLinearity\n\n:   $D(af(\\x)+bg(\\x))\\cdot\\h =\n            a(Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h+b(Dg)(\\x)\\cdot\\h$;\n\n\u201cProduct\u201d rule\n\n:   $D(B(f(\\x),g(\\x)))\\cdot\\h =\n            B((Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h,g(\\x)) + B(f(\\x),(Dg)(\\x)\\cdot\\h)$, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    where $B$ is bilinear;\n\nChain rule\n\n:   $D(g(f(\\x))\\cdot\\h =\n            (Dg)(f(\\x))\\cdot((Df)(\\x)\\cdot\\h)$.\n\nNote that the derivative of $f$ can be seen as a function $Df\\colon\n    \\V\\to L(\\V,\\W)$ given by $Df\\colon\\x\\mapsto(Df)(\\x)$, where\n$L(\\V,\\W)$ is the space of bounded linear maps from $\\V$ to $\\W$. Since\n$L(\\V,\\W)$ can be considered a Banach space itself with the norm taken\nas the operator norm, higher derivatives can be obtained by applying the\nsame procedure to $Df$ and so on.\n\nPartial derivatives\n-------------------\n\nA straightforward extension of the derivatives defined above is that of\npartial derivatives for functions of several independent variables.\nPartial derivatives have numerous applications, as for example in\nphysics and engineering; wave equations are among such important\nexamples of the use of partial derivatives in physics and engineering.\n\nManifolds {#manifolds .unnumbered}\n---------\n\nLet $\\V$ be a Banach space (for finite dimensional manifolds $\\V=\\R^n$).\nA manifold modeled on $\\V$ is a topological space that is locally\nhomeomorphic to $\\V$ and is endowed with enough structure to define\nderivatives. Since the notion of a manifold was constructed specifically\nto generalize the notion of a derivative, this seems like the end of the\nroad for this entry. The following discussion is rather technical, a\nmore intuitive explanation of the same concept can be found in the entry\non related rates.\n\nConsider manifolds $V$ and $W$ modeled on Banach spaces $\\V$ and $\\W$,\nrespectively. Say we have $y=f(x)$ for some $x\\in V$ and $y\\in W$, then,\nby definition of a manifold, we can find charts $(X,\\x)$ and $(Y,\\y)$,\nwhere $X$ and $Y$ are neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, respectively. These\ncharts provide us with canonical isomorphisms between the Banach spaces\n$\\V$ and $\\W$, and the respective tangent spaces $T_x V$ and $T_y W$:\n$$\\d\\x_x \\colon T_x V \\to \\V, \\quad\n        \\d\\y_y \\colon T_y W \\to \\W.$$\n\nNow consider a map $f\\colon V\\to W$ between the manifolds. By composing\nit with the chart maps we construct the map\n$$g_{(X,\\x)}^{(Y,\\y)}=\\y\\of f\\of \\x^{-1} \\colon \\V \\to \\W,$$ defined on\nan appropriately domain. Since we now have a map between Banach spaces,\nwe can define its derivative at $\\x(x)$ in the sense defined above,\nnamely $Dg_{(X,\\x)}^{(Y,\\y)}(\\x(x))$. If this derivative exists for\nevery choice of admissible charts $(X,\\x)$ and $(Y,\\y)$, we can say that\nthe derivative of $Df(x)$ of $f$ at $x$ is defined and given by\n$$Df(x) = \\d\\y_y^{-1}\\of Dg_{(X,\\x)}^{(Y,\\y)}(\\x(x)) \\of \\d\\x_x$$ (it\ncan be shown that this is well defined and independent of the choice of\ncharts).\n\nNote that the derivative is now a map between the tangent spaces of the\ntwo manifolds $Df(x)\\colon T_x V \\to T_y W$. Because of this a common\nnotation for the derivative of $f$ at $x$ is $T_x f$. Another\nalternative notation for the derivative is $f_{*,x}$ because of its\nconnection to the category-theoretical pushforward.\n\nDistributions {#distributions .unnumbered}\n-------------\n\nDerivatives can also be generalized in less \u201csmooth\u201d contexts. For\nexample the derivative is one of that can be defined for distributions.\n\nStandard connection of $\\R^n$ {#standard-connection-of-rn .unnumbered}\n-----------------------------\n\nLet $\\Omega$ be an open set in $\\R^n$. There is an operator on vectors\nfields in $\\Omega$ which measure how a pair of them,\n$X,Y:\\Omega\\to \\R^n$ vary, one with respect to the other: $$D_XY=(JY)X$$\nHere $JY$ is the Jacobian of $Y$, so when we multiply, we can see that\nthe components of $D_XY$ are the directional variations of the\ncomponents of $Y$ in the direction $X$.\n\nAdditional Topic {#additional-topic .unnumbered}\n----------------\n\n-   Non-Newtonian calculus\n\n[^1]: The notation $A\\cdot\\h$ is used when $\\h$ is a vector and $A$ a\n    linear operator. This notation can be considered advantageous to the\n    usual notation $A(\\h)$, since the latter is rather bulky and the\n    former incorporates the intuitive distributive properties of linear\n    operators also associated with usual multiplication.",
