  "definition": "The [*difference quotient*]{} $$\\frac{f(z+\\Delta{z})-f(z)}{\\Delta{z}}$$\nof a or real function $f$ is the ratio of the change of the function to\nthe corresponding change of the variable.\n\nThe difference quotient is needed in defining the derivative of the\nfunction. In the case of a real function $f$ the difference quotient may\nbe interpreted as the slope of a secant line of the graph of the\nfunction.",
