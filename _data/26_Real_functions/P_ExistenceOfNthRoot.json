  "statement": "If $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a>0$ and $n$ is a positive integer, then\nthere exists a unique positive real number $u$ such that $u^n=a$.\n\nThe statement is clearly true for $n=1$ (let $u=a$). Thus, it will be\nassumed that $n>1$.\n\nDefine $p \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $p(x)=x^n-a$. Note that a\npositive real root of $p(x)$ corresponds to a positive real number $u$\nsuch that $u^n=a$.\n\nIf $a=1$, then $p(1)=1^n-1=0$, in which case the existence of $u$ has\nbeen established.\n\nNote that $p(x)$ is a polynomial function and thus is continuous. If\n$a<1$, then $p(1)=1^n-a>1-1=0$. If $a>1$, then\n$p(a)=a^n-a=a(a^{n-1}-1)>0$. Note also that $p(0)=0^n-a=-a<0$. Thus, if\n$a \\neq 1$, then the intermediate value theorem can be applied to yield\nthe existence of $u$.\n\nFor uniqueness, note that the function $p(x)$ is strictly increasing on\nthe interval $(0, \\infty)$. It follows that $u$ as described in the\nstatement of the theorem exists uniquely.",
