The *measure of hyperbolic angle* $\\alpha$ is the area of\n$A(P)$ (or twice the area of $B(P)$). A *hyperbolic angle* is the\nhyperbolic angle $\\alpha$ at some point $P\\in H_1$, whose measure is the\nmeasure of $\\alpha$. Let $P,Q\\in H_1$. Suppose $B(P)\\subseteq B(Q)$. The\n*hyperbolic angle between* $P$ and $Q$ is the region $B(Q)-B(P)$ (set\ndifference). The *measure* of the hyperbolic angle between $P$ and $Q$\nis the area of $A(Q)-A(P)$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The above definition is similar to the definition of the measure of\n    the ordinary angle: given a unit circle $C$ and a point\n    $P=(a,b)\\in C$, the measure of the angle $\\theta$ at $P$ is the arc\n    length from the $x$-axis to $P$ along $C$ (moving in the\n    counterclockwise direction, as indicated by the red arc below). The\n    value of the arc length is the same as the value of area of the\n    yellow region (bounded by $C$, and the lines $\\overline{OP}$ and\n    $\\overline{OP'}$, where $P'=(a,-b)$). Therefore, we can equivalently\n    define the measure of $\\theta$ to be the area of the yellow region.\n\n    (-3,-2.5)(3,2.25) (-0.3,-0.2)(1.95,1.3) (-0.3,0.2)(1.95,-1.3)\n\n    [(0,0)[1.9]{}]{} (0,0)(3,2)(3,0)(3,-2)\n\n    (0,0)[1.9]{} (0,0)(-2.5,-2.25)(2.5,2.25) (-0.2,2.25)[$y$]{}\n    (2.5,-0.2)[$x$]{} (0.7,0.225)[$\\theta$]{} (1.7,1.35)[$P$]{} (0,0)\n    (1.9,0) (1.581,1.054) (1.581,-1.054) (-2.5,0)[.]{} (0,-2.25)[.]{}\n\n-   It is not hard to see that for every real number $r\\ge 0$, there is\n    a *unique* hyperbolic angle $\\alpha$ whose measure is $r$. The\n    uniqueness part is clear. The existence is guaranteed because the\n    area of $B(P)$ is a continuous unbounded real-valued function. In\n    other words, measure of a hyperbolic angle can take on any\n    non-negative real number, unlike the measure of an ordinary angle,\n    which is bounded by $[-1,1]$.\n\nWe are now in the position to characterize hyperbolic functions. Again,\nlet $P=(a,b)\\in H_1$ with $b\\ge 0$. Let $\\alpha=B(P)$ be the hyperbolic\nangle at $P$. Because of the second remark above, let us identify\n$\\alpha$ with its measure, so that $\\alpha$ is now viewed as a\nnon-negative real number. We will draw some lines:\n\n1.  Draw a line $\\ell$ through $P$ so that $\\ell \\perp x$-axis, and let\n    $Q$ be the intersection.\n\n2.  Let $R$ be the intersection of $H_1$ and the $x$-axis. Draw a line\n    $n$ through $R$ so that $n\\perp x$-axis, and let $S$ be the\n    intersection.\n\n(-0.5,-0.45)(2.1,1.6) (0,0)(1.342,0.894)(1,0) (0,0)(-0.5,-0.4)(2.1,1.6)\n(-0.2,1.5)[$y$]{} (2,-0.2)[$x$]{} (2.1,1.5)[$H_1$]{} (0.2,-0.2)[$O$]{}\n(-0.3,-0.2)(1.8,1.2) (1.342,-0.2)(1.342,1.3) (1,-0.3)(1,1.2)\n(1.342,0)(1.342,0.894) (0,0)(1.342,0) (1,0)(1,0.667) (1.5,0.8)[$P$]{}\n(1.5,-0.2)[$Q$]{} (0.8,-0.2)[$R$]{} (0.8,0.8)[$S$]{} (1.342,0) (0,0)\n(1,0) (1.342,0.894) (1,0.667) (-0.5,0)[.]{} (0,-0.4)[.]{}\n\nWith the lines drawn, we define\n\n-   $\\sinh \\alpha:=$ the length of the line segment $PQ$ (in red),\n\n-   $\\cosh \\alpha:=$ the length of the line segment $OQ$ (in blue),\n\n-   $\\tanh \\alpha:=$ the length of the line segment $RS$ (in green).\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Again, we see the parallel in definition between the hyperbolic\n    functions and the corresponding trigonometric functions. For\n    example, if we refer to the diagram of the circle above,\n    $\\sin \\theta$ is defined as the length of the line segment $PQ$,\n    where $Q$ is the intersection of the $x$-axis and the line $\\ell$\n    through $P$ perpendicular to the $x$-axis. $\\tan \\theta$, on the\n    other hand, is the length of the line segment $RS$ where $R=(1,0)$\n    and $S$ is the intersection of $\\overline{OP}$ and the line passing\n    through $R$ and perpendicular to the $x$-axis.\n\n-   It can be shown, that the above definitions are equivalent to the\n    analytic definitions of the hyperbolic functions for non-negative\n    real valued $\\alpha$. Of course, to extend the domain of the\n    hyperbolic functions to all real numbers, and finally to all complex\n    numbers, we would employ the analytic definitions instead.",
