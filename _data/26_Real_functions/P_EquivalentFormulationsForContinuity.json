  "statement": "Suppose $f\\colon X\\to Y$ is a function between topological spaces $X$,\n$Y$. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $f$ is continuous.\n\n2.  If $B$ is open in $Y$, then $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $X$.\n\n3.  If $B$ is closed in $Y$, then $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$.\n\n4.  $f\\!\\left(\\closure{A}\\right)\\subseteq\\closure{f(A)}$ for all\n    $A\\subseteq X$.\n\n5.  If $(x_i)$ is a net in $X$ converging to $x$, then $(f(x_i))$ is a\n    net in $Y$ converging to $f(x)$. The concept of net can be replaced\n    by the more familiar one of sequence if the spaces $X$ and $Y$ are\n    first countable.\n\n6.  Whenever two nets $S$ and $T$ in $X$ converge to the same point,\n    then $f \\circ S$ and $f \\circ T$ converge to the same point in $Y$.\n\n7.  If $\\mathbb{F}$ is a filter on $X$ that converges to $x$, then\n    $f(\\mathbb{F})$ is a filter on $Y$ that converges to $f(x)$. Here,\n    $f(\\mathbb{F})$ is the filter generated by the filter base\n    $\\lbrace f(F)\\mid F\\in \\mathbb{F}\\rbrace$.\n\n8.  If $B$ is any element of a $\\mathcal{S}$ for the topology of $Y$,\n    then $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $X$.\n\n9.  If $B$ is any element of a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ for the topology of\n    $Y$, then $f^{-1}(B)$ is open in $X$.\n\n10. If $x \\in X$, and $N$ is any neighborhood of $f(x)$, then\n    $f^{-1}(N)$ is a neighborhood of $x$.\n\n11. $f$ is continuous at every point in $X$.",
