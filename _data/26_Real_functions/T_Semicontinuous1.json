  "definition": "Suppose $X$ is a topological space, and $f$ is a function from $X$ into\nthe extended real numbers $\\mathbb{R}^*$; $f:X\\to \\mathbb{R}^*$. Then:\n\n1.  If $f^{-1}((\\alpha,\\infty])=\\{x\\in X \\mid f(x) >\\alpha\\}$ is an open\n    set in $X$ for all $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is said to be\n    [**lower semicontinuous**]{}.\n\n2.  If $f^{-1}([-\\infty,\\alpha))=\\{x\\in X \\mid f(x) <\\alpha\\}$ is an\n    open set in $X$ for all $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is said to\n    be [**upper semicontinuous**]{}.\n\nIn other words, $f$ is lower semicontinuous, if $f$ is continuous with\nrespect to the topology for $\\mathbb{R}^*$ containing $\\emptyset$ and\nopen sets\n$$U(\\alpha) = (\\alpha,\\infty], \\quad \\quad \\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}\\cup \\{-\\infty\\}.$$\nIt is not difficult to see that this is a topology. For example, for a\nunion of sets $U(\\alpha_i)$ we have\n$\\cup_i U(\\alpha_i)=U(\\inf \\alpha_i)$. Obviously, this topology is much\ncoarser than the usual topology for the extended numbers. However, the\nsets $U(\\alpha)$ can be seen as neighborhoods of infinity, so in some\nsense, semicontinuous functions are \u201ccontinuous at infinity\u201d (see\nexample 3 below).\n\n### Examples\n\n1.  A function $f\\colon X\\to \\mathbb{R}^*$ is continuous if and only if\n    it is lower and upper semicontinuous.\n\n2.  Let $f$ be the characteristic function of a set $\\Omega\\subseteq X$.\n    Then $f$ is lower (upper) semicontinuous if and only if $\\Omega$ is\n    open (closed). This also holds for the function that equals $\\infty$\n    in the set and $0\\,$ outside.\n\n    It follows that the characteristic function of ${\\mathbb{Q}}$ is not\n    semicontinuous.\n\n3.  On $\\mathbb{R}$, the function $f(x)=1/x$ for $x\\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$,\n    is not semicontinuous. This example illustrate how semicontinuous\n    \u201cat infinity\u201d.\n\n### Properties\n\nLet $f\\colon X\\to \\mathbb{R}^*$ be a function.\n\n1.  Restricting $f$ to a subspace preserves semicontinuity.\n\n2.  Suppose $f$ is upper (lower) semicontinuous, $A$ is a topological\n    space, and $\\Psi\\colon A\\to X$ is a homeomorphism. Then $f\\circ\\Psi$\n    is upper (lower) semicontinuous.\n\n3.  Suppose $f$ is upper (lower) semicontinuous, and\n    $S\\colon \\mathbb{R}^*\\to \\mathbb{R}^*$ is a sense preserving\n    homeomorphism. Then $S\\circ f$ is upper (lower) semicontinuous.\n\n4.  $f$ is lower semicontinuous if and only if $-f$ is upper\n    semicontinuous.\n\n[9]{} W.
