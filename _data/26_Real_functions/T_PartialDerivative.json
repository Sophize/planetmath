  "definition": "The *partial derivative* of a multivariable function $f$ is simply its\nderivative with respect to only one variable, keeping all other\nvariables constant (which are not functions of the variable in\nquestion). The formal definition is\n$$D_if(\\mathbf{a})=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a_i} = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{h}\\left(f\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a_1\\\\ \\vdots\\\\a_i+h\\\\ \\vdots\\\\a_n\\end{array}\\right) - f\\left(\\mathbf{a}\\right)\\right)\n= \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(\\mathbf{a}+h\\vec{e}_i)-f(\\mathbf{a})}{h}$$\nwhere $\\vec{e}_i$ is the standard basis vector of the $i$th variable.\nSince this only affects the $i$th variable, one can derive the function\nusing common rules and tables, treating all other variables (which are\nnot functions of $a_i$) as constants. For example, if\n$f(\\mathbf{x})=x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + y^3z$, then\\\n$$\\begin{array}{lll}\n(1)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = & 2x + 2y\\\\\n&&\\\\\n(2)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = & 2x + 2y + 3y^2z\\\\\n&&\\\\\n(3)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = & y^3\n\\end{array}$$ Note that in equation $(1)$, we treated $y$ as a constant,\nsince we were differentiating with respect to $x$.\n$\\left(\\frac{d(c*x)}{dx} = c\\right)$ The partial derivative of a\nvector-valued function $\\vec{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ with respect to variable\n$a_i$ is a vector\n$\\overrightarrow{D_i\\mathbf{f}}=\\frac{\\partial\\vec{f}}{\\partial a_i}$.\\\n**Multiple Partials**:\\\nMultiple partial derivatives can be treated just like multiple\nderivatives. There is an additional degree of freedom though, as you can\ncompound derivatives with respect to different variables. For example,\nusing the above function, $$\\begin{array}{llll}\n(4)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x + 2y) & = 2\\\\\n&&&\\\\\n(5)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z \\partial y} & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(2x + 2y + 3y^2z) & = 3y^2\\\\\n&&&\\\\\n(6)\\;\\; & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial z} & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^3) & = 3y^2\n\\end{array}$$ $D_{12}$ is another way of writing\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2}$. If $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is\ncontinuous in the neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}$, and $D_{ij}f$ and\n$D_{ji}f$ are continuous in an open set $V$, it can be shown (see ) that\n$D_{ij}f(\\mathbf{x}) = D_{ji}f(\\mathbf{x})$ in $V$, where $i,j$ are the\nith and jth variables. In fact, as long as an equal number of partials\nare taken with respect to each variable, changing the order of\ndifferentiation will produce the same results in the above condition.\\\nAnother form of notation is $f^{(a,b,c,...)}(\\mathbf{x})$ where $a$ is\nthe partial derivative with respect to the first variable $a$ times, $b$\nis the partial with respect to the second variable $b$ times, etc.",
