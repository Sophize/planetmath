  "definition": "Recall that a function $f:I\\to\\mathbb{R}$, where $I\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$\nis an interval, is called a **Darboux function** if it satisfies the\nintermediate value theorem. This means, that if $a,b\\in I$ and\n$f(a)\\leqslant d\\leqslant f(b)$ for some $d\\in\\mathbb{R}$, then there\nexists $c\\in I$ such that $a\\leqslant c\\leqslant b$ and $f(c)=d$.\n\nDarboux proved (see parent object) that if $f:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is\ndifferentiable then $f'$ is a Darboux function. The class of Darboux\nfunctions is very wide. It can be shown that any function\n$f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ can be written as a sum of two Darboux\nfunctions. We wish to give more general definiton of Darboux function.\n\n**Definition.** Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces. Function $f:X\\to Y$\nis called a **(generalized) Darboux function** if and only if whenever\n$C\\subseteq X$ is a connected subset, then so is $f(C)\\subseteq Y$.\n\nIt can be easily proved that connected subsets of intervals (in\n$\\mathbb{R}$) are exactly intervals. Thus this definition coincides with\nclassical definiton, when $X$ is an interval and $Y=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNote that every continuous map is a Darboux function.\n\nAlso the composition of Darboux functions is again a Darboux function\nand thus the class of all topological spaces, together with Darboux\nfunctions forms a category. The category of topological spaces and\ncontinuous maps is its subcategory.",
