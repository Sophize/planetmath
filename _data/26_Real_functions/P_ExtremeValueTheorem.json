By the boundedness\ntheorem $f([a,b])$ is bounded above; let $l$ be the least upper bound of\n$f([a,b])$. Suppose, for a contradiction, that there is no $d\\in[a,b]$\nsuch that $f(d)=l$. Then the function $$g(x) = \\frac{1}{l-f(x)}$$ is\nwell defined and continuous on $[a,b]$. Since $l$ is the least upper\nbound of $f([a,b])$, for any positive real number $M$ we can find\n$\\alpha\\in[a,b]$ such that $f(\\alpha)>l-\\frac{1}{M}$, then\n$$M < \\frac{1}{l-f(\\alpha)} \\textrm{.}$$ So $g$ is unbounded on $[a,b]$.\nBut by the boundedness theorem $g$ is bounded on $[a,b]$. This\ncontradiction finishes the proof.",
