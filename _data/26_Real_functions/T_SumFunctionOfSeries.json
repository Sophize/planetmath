  "definition": "Let the terms of a series be real functions $f_n$ defined in a certain\nsubset $A_0$ of $\\mathbb{R}$; we can speak of a [*function series*]{}.\nAll points $x$ where the series $$\\begin{aligned}\n                  f_1+f_2+\\cdots\n \\end{aligned}$$ converges form a subset $A$ of $A_0$, and we have the\n[**]{} $S\\!:x\\mapsto S(x)$ of (1) defined in $A$.\n\nIf the sequence $S_1,\\,S_2,\\,\\ldots$ of the partial sums\n$S_n = f_1\\!+\\!f_2\\!+\\cdots+\\!f_n$ of the series (1) in the interval\n$[a,\\,b] \\subseteq{A}$ to a function $S\\!:x\\mapsto S(x)$, we say that\n[*the series* ]{} in this interval. We may also set the direct\n\n**Definition.** The function series (1), which converges in every point\nof the interval $[a,\\,b]$ having sum function $S:x\\mapsto S(x)$, [**]{}\nin the interval $[a,\\,b]$, if for every positive number $\\varepsilon$\nthere is an integer $n_\\varepsilon$ such that each value of $x$ in the\ninterval $[a,\\,b]$ the inequality $$|S_n(x)-S(x)| < \\varepsilon$$ when\n$n \\geqq n_\\varepsilon$.\\\n**Note.** One can without trouble be convinced that the term functions\nof a uniformly converging series converge uniformly to 0 (cf. the\nnecessary condition of convergence).\\\nThe notion of of series can be extended to the series with complex\nfunction terms (the interval is replaced with some subset of\n$\\mathbb{C}$). The significance of the is therein that the sum function\nof a series with this property and with continuous term-functions is\ncontinuous and may be integrated termwise.",
