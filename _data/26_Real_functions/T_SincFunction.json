  "definition": "[**Definition**]{} The *$\\operatorname{sinc}$-* is the function\n$\\operatorname{sinc}:{\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ defined as\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n \\operatorname{sinc}(x) &=& \\left\\{ \\begin {array}{ll} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} & \\mbox{when}\\,\\, x\\neq 0, \\\\\n 1 & \\mbox{when}\\,\\, x= 0.\n \\end{array} \\right.\n \\end{aligned}$$\n\nIn some situations, it is more convenient to work with an alternative\n\u201cnormalized variant,\u201d in which for $x\\neq 0$ we redefine the function as\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{sinc}(x)=\\frac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi x}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe remainder of this entry deals with the initial definition, though\nmost properties can clearly be suitably modified for the normalized\nversion.\n\n(-9,-2)(9,2) (0,0)(-8.5,-1.5)(8.5,2) (8.5,-0.2)[$x$]{} (0.2,2)[$y$]{}\n(1,-0.25)[$\\pi$]{} (-1.1,-0.25)[$-\\pi$]{} (0,1)\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n-   Using a Taylor expansion of $\\sin$, one can show that\n    $\\operatorname{sinc}$ is infinitely many times differentiable. In\n    particular, $\\operatorname{sinc}$ is continuous. In this sense, the\n    value $1$ for $x=0$ is motivated.\n\n-   Jordan\u2019s inequality implies that $|\\operatorname{sinc}(x)|\\le 1$ for\n    all $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}$. More generally, one can also show that all\n    derivatives of $\\operatorname{sinc}$ are bounded by 1. See .\n\n-   $\\operatorname{sinc}$ is an even function.\n\n-   The zeros of $\\operatorname{sinc}$ are $x=\\pm \\pi, \\pm 2\\pi,\\ldots$.\n\n-   $\\operatorname{sinc}$ is in $L^2$, but not in $L^1$, and [@gearhart]\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\operatorname{sinc}(x)\\,dx &=& \\pi,\\\\\n    \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\operatorname{sinc}^2(x)\\,dx &=& \\pi,\\end{aligned}$$\n    where the first of these denotes an improper Riemann integral.\n\n-   For all $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}$, we have [@gearhart] $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\operatorname{sinc} (x) &=& \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\frac{x^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}, \\\\\n    \\operatorname{sinc} (x) &=& \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{(k\\pi)^2}\\right), \\\\\n    \\operatorname{sinc} (x) &=& \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\cos \\frac{x}{2^k}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n-   The Fourier transform of $\\operatorname{sinc}$ is the box function,\n    i.e. $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\operatorname{sinc}(x) = {1\\over 2} \\int_{-1}^1 e^{ixt} dt.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n-   The $\\operatorname{sinc}$ function satisfies the differential\n    equation $$\\begin{aligned}\n     x \\operatorname{sinc}'' + 2 \\operatorname{sinc}' + x \\operatorname{sinc} = 0\\end{aligned}$$\n    This is a consequence of a comment in the sine integral entry.\n\n-   There is no known simple expression for the integral of sinc.\n    However, this function is known as the sine integral.\n\n### Synonym and Etymology {#synonym-and-etymology .unnumbered}\n\nThe $\\operatorname{sinc}$ function is also called or .\n\n### Use {#use .unnumbered}\n\nThe sinc function is relevant in several fields. For one, its Fourier\ntransform is a box, so it is the frequency respose of a perfect on/off\nsampling device, and therefore often the correct way to interpolate\nbetween frequencies in a sampled signal. The resulting function is in\nfact analytic on the entire complex plane.\n\n[9]{} W.B.
