  "definition": "The Helmholtz theorem states that any vector $\\mathbf{F}$ may be\ndecomposed into an irrotational (curl-free) and a solenoidal\n(divergence-free) part under certain conditions (given below). More\nprecisely, it may be written in the form:\n$$\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla \\varphi + \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$$ where\n$\\varphi$ is a scalar potential and $\\mathbf{A}$ is a vector potential.\nBy the definitions of scalar and vector potentials it follows that the\nfirst term on the right-hand side is irrotational and the second is\nsolenoidal. The general conditions for this to be true are:\n\n1.  The divergence of $\\mathbf{F}$ must vanish at infinity.\n\n2.  The curl of $\\mathbf{F}$ must also vanish at infinity.",
