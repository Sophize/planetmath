  "definition": "Let the vector field $\\vec{U}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ be interpreted, as in\nthe remark of the , as the velocity of a liquid. Then the flux\n$$\\oint_a\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a}$$ of $\\vec{U}$ through a closed surface\n$a$ expresses how much more liquid per time-unit it comes from inside of\n$a$ to outside than contrarily. Since for a usual incompressible liquid,\nthe outwards flow and the inwards flow are equal, we must think in the\ncase that the flux differs from 0 either that the flowing liquid is\nsuitably compressible or that there are inside the surface some\n[*sources*]{} creating liquid and [*sinks*]{} annihilating liquid.\nOrdinarily, one uses the latter idea. Both the sources and the sinks may\nbe called sources, when the sinks are [*negative sources*]{}. The flux\nof the vector $\\vec{U}$ through $a$ is called the [*productivity*]{} or\nthe [*strength*]{} of the sources inside $a$.\n\nFor example, the sources and sinks of an electric field ($\\vec{E}$) are\nthe locations containing positive and negative charges, respectively.\nThe gravitational field has only sinks, which are the locations\ncontaining .\\\nThe expression\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta v}\\oint_{\\partial\\Delta v}\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a},$$\nwhere $\\Delta v$ means a region in the vector field and also its volume,\nis the productivity of the sources in $\\Delta v$ per a volume-unit. When\nwe let $\\Delta v$ to shrink towards a point $P$ in it, to an\ninfinitesimal volume-element $dv$, we get the limiting value\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\varrho \\;:=\\; \\frac{1}{dv}\\oint_{\\partial dv}\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a},\\end{aligned}$$\ncalled the [*source density*]{} in $P$. Thus the productivity of the\nsource in $P$ is $\\varrho\\,dv$. If $\\varrho = 0$, there is in $P$\nneither a source, nor a sink.\\\nThe Gauss\u2019s theorem\n$$\\int_v\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{U}\\,dv \\;=\\; \\oint_a\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a}$$\napplied to $dv$ says that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{U} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{dv}\\oint_{\\partial dv}\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a}.\\end{aligned}$$\nAccordingly, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\varrho \\;=\\; \\nabla\\cdot\\vec{U}\\end{aligned}$$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\oint_{a}\\vec{U}\\cdot d\\vec{a} \\;=\\; \\int_v\\varrho\\,dv.\\end{aligned}$$\nThis last can be read that [*the flux of the vector through a closed\nsurface equals to the total productivity of the sources inside the\nsurface.*]{} For example, if $\\vec{U}$ is the electric flux density\n$\\vec{D}$, (4) means that the electric flux through a closed surface\nequals to the total charge inside.",
