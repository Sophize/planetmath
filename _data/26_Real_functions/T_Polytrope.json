  "definition": "#### Mathematical concept\n\nLet $n$ be a nonnegative constant. A *polytropic equation* expresses\nthat the real variable $y$ is inversely proportional to the power $x^n$\nof the real variable $x$. So, it is a question of the equation\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ny \\;=\\; \\frac{c}{x^n}\\end{aligned}$$ where $c$ is another constant.\n\nThe graph of a polytropic equation is called a *polytrope*. It has the\ncoordinate axes as asymptotes for $n \\neq 0$. Special cases of polytrope\nare the hyperbola $y = \\frac{c}{x}$ and the *cubic hyperbola*\n$$y = \\frac{c}{x^2}.$$\\\nBelow one sees the halves of three polytropes given by the integer $n$\nvalues 0 (green), 1 (cyan) and 2 (blue); farther below a whole cubic\nhyperbola.\n\n(-0.5,-0.5)(7,5.7) (0,0)(5.4,5.4) (5.6,-0.2)[$x$]{} (-0.2,5.6)[$y$]{}\n(1,1) (3.5,3)[$\\displaystyle y \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{x^n}$ for\n$n = 0,\\,1,\\,2$]{}\n\n(-7,-0.5)(7,5.7) (0,0)(-5.4,0)(5.4,5.4) (5.6,-0.2)[$x$]{}\n(-0.2,5.6)[$y$]{} (0,0) (3.5,3)[Cubic hyperbola\n$\\displaystyle y \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{x^2}$]{}\n\n#### An application to thermodynamics: The reversible polytropic process\n\nWhen a gas undergoes a reversible process in which there is heat\ntransfer, the process frequently takes place in such a manner that a\nplot of $\\log{p}$ vs. $\\log{v}$ is a straight line. Here $p$ denotes\nabsolute pressure (e.g. in psia) and $v$ specific volume (e.g. in\n$ft^3/lbm$). For such a process $$pv^n = \\mbox{constant}.$$ This is\ncalled a *polytropic process*. Indeed this equation represents a\n*constitutive equation* since it can be verifiable experimentally in a\nlab for different processes of heat transfer, i.e. for distinct rational\nvalues of $n$. It is obvious, from the above equation, that\n$$\\frac{d \\log{p}}{d \\log{v}} = -n,$$ where $-n$ is the slope of the\nstraight line on the mentioned logarithmic chart. Typical polytropic\nprocesses are tabulated as follow.\\\n\n[|c|c|c|c|]{}\\\n& [**Constant** ]{} & [**$n$**]{} & [**Physical** ]{}\\\nIsobaric & $p$ & 0 & lbf/in$^2$ abs.\\\nIsothermal & $T$ & 1 & $^{\\circ}\\mathrm{R}$\\\nIsentropic & $s$ & $k$ & Btu/lbm-$^{\\circ}\\mathrm{R}$\\\nIsochoric(Isovolumetric) & $v$ & $\\infty$ & ft$^3$/lbm\\\n\nLegend: $p$ $=$ abs. pressure; $T$ $=$ abs. temperature; $s$ $=$\nspecific entropy; $v$ $=$ specific volume\\\nIn general, one may have more complex processes of heat transfer where\n$n$ is any rational number (e.g. $n = -2,\\,-1,\\, -0.5$, etc.). Specific\nexamples are the expansion of the combustion gases in the cylinders of\nwater-cooled internal combustion engines and reciprocating machines. In\nsuch cases the pressure and volume during a polytropic process are\nmeasured, as might be done with an *engine indicator*, so that the\nlogarithm of the pressure and volume are plotted in to know the\n*polytropic constant* $n$.\\",
