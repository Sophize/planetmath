  "statement": "Let $f \\colon (0,\\infty) \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be Riemann integrable and\nuniformly continuous then $$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} f(t) = 0 .$$\n\nNote that if $f$ is non-negative, then Riemann integrability is the same\nas being $L^1$ in the sense of Lebesgue, but if $f$ oscillates then the\nLebesgue integral may not exist.\n\nFurther note that the uniform continuity is required to prevent sharp\n\u201cspikes\u201d that might prevent the limit from existing. For example suppose\nwe add a spike of height 1 and area $2^{-n}$ at every integer. Then the\nfunction is continuous and $L^1$ (and thus Riemann integrable), but\n$f(t)$ would not have a limit at infinity.\n\n[9]{} Hartmut Logemann, Eugene P.
