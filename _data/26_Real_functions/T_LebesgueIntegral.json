  "definition": "The *integral* of a measurable function\n$f\\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\pm \\infty\\}$ on a measure space\n$(X, {\\mathfrak{B}}, \\mu)$ is usually written\n\n$$\\int_{X} f\\ d\\mu,$$\n\nalthough alternative notations such as $\\int_X f\\ dx$ or even $\\int f$\nare commonplace.\n\nIt is defined via the following steps:\n\n-   If $f = {{{\\bf 1}}}_A$ is the characteristic function of a set\n    $A \\in {\\mathfrak{B}}$, then set\n    $$\\int_{X} {{{\\bf 1}}}_A\\ d\\mu {:=}\\mu(A).$$\n\n-   If $f$ is a *simple function* (i.e. if $f$ can be written as\n    $$f = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k {{{\\bf 1}}}_{A_k}, \\qquad c_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\n    for some finite collection $A_k \\in \\mathfrak{B}$), then define\n    $$\\int_{X} f\\ d\\mu {:=}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k \\int_{X} {{{\\bf 1}}}_{A_k}\\ d\\mu = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k \\mu(A_k).$$\n\n-   If $f$ is a nonnegative measurable function (possibly attaining the\n    value $\\infty$ at some points), then we define\n    $$\\int_{X} f\\ d\\mu {:=}\\sup\\left\\{ \\int_{X} h\\ d\\mu : h \\text{ is simple and  } h(x) \\le f(x) \\text{ for all }\\ x \\in X \\right\\}.$$\n\n-   For any measurable function $f$ (possibly attaining the values\n    $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$ at some points), write $f = f^{+} - f^{-}$\n    where\n    $$f^{+} {:=}\\max(f, 0) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f^{-} {:=}\\max(-f, 0),$$\n    so that $|f|=f^+ + f^-$, and define the integral of $f$ as\n    $$\\int_{X} f\\ d\\mu {:=}\\int_{X} f^{+}\\ d\\mu - \\int_{X} f^{-}\\ d\\mu,$$\n    provided that $\\int_{X} f^{+}\\ d\\mu$ and $\\int_{X} f^{-}\\ d\\mu$ are\n    not both $\\infty$.\n\nIf $\\mu$ is Lebesgue measure and $X$ is any interval in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$\nthen the integral is called the *Lebesgue integral*. If the Lebesgue\nintegral of a function $f$ on a set $X$ exists and is finite (or,\nequivalently, if $\\int_X |f|\\ d\\mu < \\infty$), then $f$ is said to be\n*Lebesgue integrable*. The Lebesgue integral equals the Riemann integral\neverywhere the latter is defined; the advantage to the Lebesgue integral\nis that it is often well defined even when the corresponding Riemann\nintegral is undefined. For example, the Riemann integral of the\ncharacteristic function of the rationals in $[0,1]$ is undefined, while\nthe Lebesgue integral of this function is simply the measure of the\nrationals in $[0,1]$, which is 0. Moreover, the conditions under which\nLebesgue integrals may be exchanged with each other or with limits or\nderivatives, etc., are far less stringent, making the Lebesgue theory a\nmore convenient tool than the Riemann integral for theoretical purposes.\n\nThe introduction of the Lebesgue integral was a major advancement in\nreal analysis, soon awakening a large interest in the scientific\ncommunity. In 1916 Edward Burr Van Vleck, in \u201cBulletin of the American\nMathematical Society\u201d, vol. 23, wrote: \u201cThis new integral of Lebesgue is\nproving itself a wonderful tool. I might compare it with a modern Krupp\ngun, so easily does it penetrate barriers which were impregnable.\u201d",
