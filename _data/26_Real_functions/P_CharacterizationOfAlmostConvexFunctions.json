  "statement": "A real function $f$ is almost convex iff it is monotonic or there exists\n$p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is nonincreasing on the half-line\n$(-\\infty, p)$ and nondecreasing on the half-line $(p,+\\infty)$\n\n[**Proof:**]{}\n\nThe proof is based on some simple observations about the values of an\nalmost convex function. Suppose that $a < b$ and $f(a) \\le f(b)$. Then\nfor any $c > b$, it must be the case that $f(b) \\le f(c)$. This follows\nfrom the fact that, by definition of almost convex, either\n$f(b) \\le f(a)$ or $f(b) \\le f(c)$. Since the first option is excluded\nby assumption, the second option must be true.\n\nFurthermore, with $a$, $b$ as above, $f$ is nondecreasing in the\nhalf-line $[b,\\infty)$. By the result of the last paragraph, it suffices\nto show that $f$ is non-decreasing in the open half-line $(c,\\infty)$.\nThis is tantamount to showing that, if $c < d < e$, then\n$f(d) \\le f(e)$. From the conlusion of last paragraph, we already know\nthat $f(c) \\le f(d)$. Applying the result shown in the last paragraph to\nthis conclusion, we further conclude that $f(d) \\le f(e)$, as desired.\n\nBy replacing \u201c$\\le$\u201d by \u201c$\\ge$\u201d in the above two paragraphs suitably, we\nalso can likewise that, if $a < b$ and $f(a) \\ge f(b)$, then $f$ is\nnonincreasing on the half-line $(-\\infty,a]$.\n\nNow assume that $f$ is almost convex but not monotonic. By the\nhypothesis of nonmomotonicity, there must exist $a < b < c$ such that it\nis the case that neither $f(a) \\le f(b) \\le f(c)$ nor\n$f(a) \\ge f(b) \\ge f(c)$. Furthermore, by almost-convexity, it follows\nthat $f(b) \\le f(a)$ and $f(b) \\le f(c)$. This, in turn, implies that\n$f$ is nonincreasing on $(-\\infty,a]$ and nondecreasing on\n$[c,+\\infty)$.\n\nLet $L$ be the set of all real numbers $q$ such that $f$ is\nnondecreasing on the interval $(q,+\\infty)$. This set is not empty\nbecause $c \\in L$. It is a proper subset of the real line because, for\ninstance, $q \\notin L$ whenever $q < a$. This follows from the\nobservation that $f$ cannot be nondecreasing on $(q,+\\infty)$ because\n$f(a) > f(b)$. Also, $L$ must be a proper subset of the real line,\nbecause, if it were not, $f$ would be nondecreasing on the whole real\nline, which is contrary to assumption.\n\nNote that, if $r < q$ and $q \\notin L$, then $r \\notin L$ as well. This\nis an expression of the fact that, if a function is not monotonic on a\nset, it is not monotonic on a superset, which is the contrapositive of\nthe assertion that a the resticition of a function which is monotonic on\na set to a subset is still monotonic. Since there exists a real number\n$r$ such that $r \\notin L$, this means that $r$ is a lower bound for\n$L$. Since $L$ is bounded from below and not empty, it follows that $L$\nhas a greatest lower bound, which we shall call $p$.\n\nBy construction, $f$ is non-decreasing on the half-line $(p,+\\infty)$.\nWe will now show that $f$ is nonincreasing on the half-line\n$(-\\infty,p)$. Suppose that $q < p$. Then, by the choice of $p$, the\nfunction $f$ is not nondecreasing on the half-line $(q,+\\infty)$. This\nmeans that there must exist $a,b$ such that $q < a < b$ and\n$f(a) > f(b)$. By the result demonstrated above, it follows that $f$ is\nnonincreasing on $(-\\infty,a)$, hence, since $q < a$, in particular, $f$\nis nononicreasing on $(-\\infty,q)$. Since $f$ is nonincreasing on\n$(-\\infty,q)$ for all $q$, it is the case that $f$ is nonincreasing on\n$(-\\infty,p)$.",
