Then $F(x)-F(a) = \\int_a^xf(t)\\,dt$.\n\n$\\,$\n\nObservations\n------------\n\nNotice that the second fundamental theorem is not a converse of the\nfirst. In the first we conclude that $F'=f$ except in a set of , while\nin the second we assume that $F'=f$ except in a finite number of points.\nIn fact, the two theorems can never be the converse of each other as the\nfollowing example shows:\n\n[**Example :**]{} Let $F$ be the devil staircase function, defined on\n$[0,1]$. We have that\n\n-   $F$ is continuous in $[0,1]$,\n\n-   $F'=0$ except in a set of (this set must be contained in the Cantor\n    set),\n\n-   $f:=0$ is clearly a Riemann integrable function and\n    $\\int_0^x 0\\,dt = 0$.\n\nThus, $F(x) \\neq \\int_0^x F'(t)\\,dt$.\n\nThis leads to the question: what kind functions $F$ can be expressed as\n$F(x) = F(a) + \\int_a^x g(t)\\,dt$, for some function $g$ ? The answer to\nthis question lies in the concept of (a which the devil staircase does\nnot possess), but for that a more general of integration must be\ndeveloped (the ).",
