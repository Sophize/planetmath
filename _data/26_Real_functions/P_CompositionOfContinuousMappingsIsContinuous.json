  "statement": "The composition of two continuous mappings (when defined) is continuous.\n\nLet $X,Y,Z$ be topological space, and let $f,g$ be mappings\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   f\\colon X&\\to& Y, \\\\\n   g\\colon Y&\\to& Z.\\end{aligned}$$ We wish to prove that $g\\circ f$ is\ncontinuous. Suppose $B$ is an open set in $Z$. Since $g$ is continuous,\n$g^{-1}(B)$ is an open set in $Y$, and since $f$ is continuous,\n$f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B))$ is an open set in $X$. Since\n$f^{-1}(g^{-1}(B))=(g\\circ f)^{-1}(B)$, it follows that\n$(g\\circ f)^{-1}(B)$ is open and the composition if continuous.",
