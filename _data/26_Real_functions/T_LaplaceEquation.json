  "definition": "The scalar form of *Laplace\u2019s equation* is the partial differential\nequation $${\\nabla}^2f = 0$$ and the vector form is\n$${\\nabla}^2{\\mathbf{A}}= 0,$$where ${\\nabla}^2$ is the Laplacian. It is\na special case of the Helmholtz differential equation with $k = 0.$\n\nA function $f$ which satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation is said to be\n*harmonic*. Since Laplace\u2019s equation is linear, the superposition of any\ntwo solutions is also a solution.",
