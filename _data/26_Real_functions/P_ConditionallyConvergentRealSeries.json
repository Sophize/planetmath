If, on the other hand, one of the series\n(2) were convergent and the other divergent, then we can see that (1)\nhad to diverge, contrary to what is supposed in the theorem. In fact, if\ne.g. $a_1\\!+\\!a_2\\!+\\!a_3\\!+\\ldots$ were convergent, then the partial\nsum $a_1\\!+\\!a_2\\!+\\ldots+\\!a_n$ were below a finite bound for each $n$,\nwhereas the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ partial sum of the divergent one of (2)\nwould tend to $-\\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$; then should also the\n$n^\\mathrm{th}$ partial sum of (1) tend to $-\\infty$.",
