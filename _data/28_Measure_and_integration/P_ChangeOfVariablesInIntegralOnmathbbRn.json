  "statement": "Let $g\\colon X \\to Y$ be a diffeomorphism between open subsets $X$ and\n$Y$ of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Then for any measurable function\n$f\\colon Y \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$, and any measurable set $E \\subseteq X$,\n$$\\int_E f(g(x)) \\, {\\lvert\\det \\operatorname{D}g(x) \\rvert} dx = \\int_{g(E)} f(y) \\, dy\\,.$$\nAlso, if one of these integrals does not exist, then neither does the\nother.\n\nThis theorem is a generalization of the substitution rule for integrals\nfrom one-variable calculus.\n\nTo go from the left-hand side to the right-hand side or vice versa, we\ncan perform the formal substitutions:\n$$y = g(x) \\,, \\quad dy = g(dx) = {\\lvert \\det \\operatorname{D}g(x) \\rvert} dx\\,.$$\nThe volume scaling factor ${\\lvert\\det \\operatorname{D}g(x)\\rvert}$ is\nsometimes called the *Jacobian* or *Jacobian determinant*.\n\nTheorem 1 is typically applied when integrating over ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$\nusing polar coordinates, or when integrating over ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ using\ncylindrical or spherical coordinates.\n\nIntuitively speaking, the image of a small cube centered at $x$, under a\ndifferentiable map $g$ is approximately the parallelogram resulting from\nthe linear mapping $\\operatorname{D}g(x)$ applied on that cube. If the\nvolume of the original cube is $dx$, then the volume of the image\nparallelogram is $dy = {\\lvert\\det \\operatorname{D}g(x)\\rvert} dx$. The\nintegral formula in Theorem 1 follows for an arbitrary set by\napproximating it by many numbers of small cubes, and taking limits.\n\n![Illustration of linear approximation to $g(Q)$ by\n$x + \\operatorname{D}g(x) (Q-x)$. ](jacobian.eps)\n\nProofs of Theorem 1 can be obtained by making this procedure rigorous;\nsee [@Schwartz], [@Flett], or [@Guzman].\n\nA slightly stronger version of the theorem that does not require $g$ to\nbe a diffeomorphism (i.e. that $g$ is a bijection and has non-singular\nderivative) is:\n\nLet $g\\colon X \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ be continuously differentiable on an\nopen subset $X$ of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Then for any measurable function\n$f\\colon Y \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$, and any measurable set $E \\subseteq X$,\n$$\\int_E f(g(x)) \\, {\\lvert\\det \\operatorname{D}g(x) \\rvert} \\, dx = \n \\int_{g(E)} f(y) \\, \\# g|_E^{-1}(y) \\, dy\\,,$$ where\n$\\# g|_E^{-1}(y) \\in \\{ 1, 2, \\dotsc, \\infty \\}$ counts the number of\npre-images in $E$ of $y$.\n\nObserve that Theorem 2 (as well as its proof) includes a special case of\nSard\u2019s Theorem.\n\nThe idea of Theorem 2 is that we may ignore those pieces of the set $E$\nthat transform to zero volumes, and if the map $g$ is not one-to-one,\nthen some pieces of the image $g(E)$ may be counted multiple times in\nthe left-hand integral.\n\nThese formulas can also be generalized for on ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, and\nnon-differentiable, but Lipschitz, functions $g$.
