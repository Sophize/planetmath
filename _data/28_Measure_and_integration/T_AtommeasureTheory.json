A set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$\nis called an [**atom**]{} if $A$ has positive measure and contains no\nmeasurable subsets $B \\subset A$ such that $0 < \\mu (B)< \\mu(A)$.\n\nAn equivalent definition can be: $A$ has positive measure and for every\nmeasurable subset $B \\subset A$, either $\\mu(B)=0$ or $\\mu(A-B)=0$.",
