  "statement": "Let $\\mu$ be a signed measure in the measurable space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathscr{S})$. There are two measurable sets $A$ and $B$ such\nthat:\n\n1.  $A\\cup B = \\Omega$ and $A\\cap B = \\emptyset$;\n\n2.  $\\mu(E)\\geq 0$ for each $E\\in\\mathscr{S}$ such that $E\\subset A$;\n\n3.  $\\mu(E)\\leq 0$ for each $E\\in\\mathscr{S}$ such that $E\\subset B$.\n\nThe pair $(A,B)$ is called a *Hahn decomposition* for $\\mu$. This\ndecomposition is not unique, but any other such decomposition $(A',B')$\nsatisfies $\\mu(A'\\vartriangle A) = \\mu(B\\vartriangle B') = 0$ (where\n$\\vartriangle$ denotes the symmetric difference), so the two\ndecompositions differ in a set of measure 0.",
