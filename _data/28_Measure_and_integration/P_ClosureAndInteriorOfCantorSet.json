  "statement": "The Cantor set is closed and its interior is empty.\n\nTo prove the first assertion, note that each of the sets $C_0, C_1,\nC_2, \\ldots$, being the union of a finite number of closed intervals is\nclosed. Since the Cantor set is the intersection of all these sets and\nintersections of closed sets are closed, it follows that the Cantor set\nis closed.\n\nTo prove the second assertion, it suffices to show that given any open\ninterval $I$, no matter how small, at least one point of that interval\nwill not belong to the Cantor set. To accomplish this, the ternary\ncharacterization of the Cantor set is useful. Because rational numbers\nwhose denominators are powers of 3 are dense, there exists a rational\nnumber $n/3^m$ contained in $I$. Expressed in base 3, this rational\nnumber has a finite expansion. If this expansion contains the digit \u201c1\u201d,\nthen our number does not belong to Cantor set, and we are done. If not,\nsince $I$ is open, there must exist a number $k >\nm$ such that $n/3^m + 1/3^k \\in I$. Now, the last digit of the ternary\nexpansion of this number is \u201c1\u201d by construction, so we also find a\nnumber not belonging to the interval in this case.",
