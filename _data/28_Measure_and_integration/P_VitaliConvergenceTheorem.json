  "statement": "Let $f_1, f_2, \\dotsc$ be ${\\mathbf{L}}^p$-integrable functions on some\nmeasure space, for $1 \\leq p < \\infty$.\n\nThe sequence $\\{ f_n \\}$ converges in ${\\mathbf{L}}^p$ to a measurable\nfunction $f$ if and and only if\n\n1.  the sequence $\\{ f_n \\}$ converges to $f$ in measure;\n\n2.  the functions $\\{ {\\lvertf_n\\rvert}^p \\}$ are uniformly integrable;\n    and\n\n3.  for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a set $E$ of finite measure,\n    such that $\\int_{E^\\mathrm{c}} {\\lvertf_n\\rvert}^p < \\epsilon$ for\n    all $n$.\n\nRemarks {#remarks .unnumbered}\n-------\n\nThis theorem can be used as a replacement for the more well-known\ndominated convergence theorem, when a dominating cannot be found for the\nfunctions $f_n$ to be integrated. (If this theorem is known, the\ndominated convergence theorem can be derived as a special case.)\n\nIn a finite measure space, condition (iii) is trivial. In fact,\ncondition (iii) is the tool used to reduce considerations in the general\ncase to the case of a finite measure space.\n\nIn probability , the definition of \u201cuniform integrability\u201d is slightly\ndifferent from its definition in general measure theory; either\ndefinition may be used in the statement of this theorem.\n\n[3]{} Gerald B.
