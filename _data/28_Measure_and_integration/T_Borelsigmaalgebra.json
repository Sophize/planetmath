  "definition": "For any topological space $X$, the *Borel sigma algebra* of $X$ is the\n$\\sigma$\u2013algebra $\\mathcal{B}$ generated by the open sets of $X$. In\nother words, the Borel sigma algebra is equal to the intersection of all\nsigma algebras $\\mathcal{A}$ of $X$ having the property that every open\nset of $X$ is an element of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nAn element of $\\mathcal{B}$ is called a *Borel subset* of $X$, or a\n*Borel set*.",
