  "definition": "Definition of Haar measures\n===========================\n\nLet $G$ be a locally compact topological group, and denote by\n$\\mathcal{B}$ the sigma algebra generated by the closed compact subsets\nof $G$. A *left Haar measure* on $G$ is a measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathcal{B}$\nwhich is:\n\n1.  outer regular on all sets $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$\n\n2.  inner regular on all open sets $U \\in \\mathcal{B}$\n\n3.  finite on all compact sets $K \\in \\mathcal{B}$\n\n4.  invariant under left translation: $\\mu(gB) = \\mu(B)$ for all sets\n    $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$\n\n5.  nontrivial: $\\mu(B) > 0$ for all non-empty open sets\n    $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nA *right Haar measure* on $G$ is defined similarly, except with left\ntranslation invariance replaced by right translation invariance\n($\\mu(Bg) = \\mu(B)$ for all sets $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$). A *bi-invariant\nHaar measure* is a Haar measure that is both left invariant and right\ninvariant.\n\nExistence of Haar measures\n==========================\n\nFor any discrete topological group $G$, the counting measure on $G$ is a\nbi-invariant Haar measure. More generally, every locally compact\ntopological group $G$ has a left Haar measure $\\mu$, which is unique up\nto scalar multiples. In addition, $G$ also admits a right Haar measure,\nand for an abelian group $G$ the left and right Haar measures are always\nequal. The Haar measure plays an important role in the development of\nFourier analysis and representation theory on locally compact groups\nsuch as Lie groups and profinite groups.",
