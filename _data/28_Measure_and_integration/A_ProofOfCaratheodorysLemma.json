  "argumentText": "A set $S\\subseteq X$ is $\\mu$-measurable if and only if\n$$\\label{eq:mu-measurable inequal}\n\\mu(E)\\ge\\mu(E\\cap S)+\\mu(E\\cap S^c)$$ for every $E\\subseteq X$. As this\ninequality is clearly satisfied if $S=\\emptyset$ and is unchanged when\n$S$ is replaced by $S^c$, then $\\mathcal{A}$ contains the empty set and\nis closed under taking complements of sets. To show that $\\mathcal{A}$\nis a $\\sigma$-algebra, it only remains to show that it is closed under\ntaking countable unions of sets. Choose any sets $A,B\\in\\mathcal{A}$ and\n$E\\subseteq X$. Then, $$\\begin{split}\n\\mu(E)&\\ge\\mu(E\\cap A) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c)\\\\\n&\\ge\\mu(E\\cap A) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B) + \\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B^c)\\\\\n&\\ge\\mu(E\\cap(A\\cup B))+\\mu(E\\cap A^c\\cap B^c)\n\\end{split}$$ The first two inequalities here follow from applying\n(\\[eq:mu-measurable inequal\\]) with $A$ and then $B$ in place of $S$,\nand the third uses the subadditivity of $\\mu$ together with\n$A\\cup (A^c\\cap B) = A\\cup B$. So (\\[eq:mu-measurable inequal\\]) is\nsatisfied with $A\\cup B$ in place of $S$, showing that $\\mathcal{A}$ is\nclosed under taking pairwise unions and is therefore an algebra of sets\non $X$. If $A,B$ are disjoint sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ then replacing $E$\nby $E\\cap(A\\cup B)$ and $S$ by $A$ in (\\[eq:mu-measurable inequal\\])\ngives $\\mu(E\\cap(A\\cup B))\\ge\\mu(E\\cap A)+\\mu(E\\cap B)$. As the reverse\ninequality follows from subadditivity of $\\mu$, this implies that\n$$\\mu(E\\cap(A\\cup B))=\\mu(E\\cap A)+\\mu(E\\cap B).$$ So, the map\n$A\\mapsto\\mu(E\\cap A)$ is an additive set function on $\\mathcal{A}$. In\nparticular, taking $E=X$ shows that $\\mu$ is additive on $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nNow choose a sequence $A_i\\in\\mathcal{A}$, and set\n$B_i\\equiv\\bigcup_{j=1}^{i}A_j$ which are in the algebra $\\mathcal{A}$.\nTo prove that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra it needs to be shown\nthat $A\\equiv\\bigcup_iA_i=\\bigcup_iB_i$ is itself in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nFirst, as $B_i\\in\\mathcal{A}$ and $A^c\\subseteq B_i^c$,\n$$\\mu(E)\\ge\\mu(E\\cap B_i)+\\mu(E\\cap B_i^c)\\ge\\mu(E\\cap B_i)+\\mu(E\\cap A^c).$$\nAs $C_i\\equiv B_i\\setminus B_{i-1}$ are pairwise disjoint sets in\n$\\mathcal{A}$ satisfying $\\bigcup_{j=1}^i C_j=B_i$ the additivity of\n$C\\mapsto\\mu(E\\cap C)$ on $\\mathcal{A}$ gives\n$$\\mu(E)\\ge\\sum_{j=1}^i\\mu(E\\cap C_j)+\\mu(E\\cap A^c).$$ So, letting $i$\nincrease to infinity, the subadditivity of $\\mu$ applied to\n$\\bigcup_j(E\\cap C_j)=E\\cap A$ gives\n$$\\mu(E)\\ge\\sum_j\\mu(E\\cap C_j)+\\mu(E\\cap A^c)\\ge\\mu(E\\cap A)+\\mu(E\\cap A^c).$$\nThis shows that $A$ is $\\mu$-measurable and so $\\mathcal{A}$ is a\n$\\sigma$-algebra.\n\nIt only remains to show that the restriction of $\\mu$ to $\\mathcal{A}$\nis a measure, for which it needs to be shown that $\\mu$ is countably\nadditive on $\\mathcal{A}$. So, choose any pairwise disjoint sequence\n$A_i\\in\\mathcal{A}$ and set $A=\\bigcup_iA_i$. The following inequality\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^i\\mu(A_j)=\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{j=1}^iA_j\\right)\\le\\mu(A)\\le\\sum_j\\mu(A_j)$$\nfollows from the additivity of $\\mu$ on $\\mathcal{A}$, the requirement\nthat $\\mu$ is increasing and from the countable subadditivity of $\\mu$.\nLetting $i$ increase to infinity gives $\\mu(A)=\\sum_j\\mu(A_j)$ and $\\mu$\nis indeed countably additive on $\\mathcal{A}$.",
