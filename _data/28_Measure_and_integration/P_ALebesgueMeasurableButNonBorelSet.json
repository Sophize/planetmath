It can be shown that this set is\nLebesgue measurable, but not Borel measurable.\n\nIn fact, it can be shown that $S$ is an , meaning that it is the image\nof a continuous function $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ for some\nPolish space $X$ and, consequently, $S$ is a universally measurable set.\n\nThis example is due to Lusin (1927).",
