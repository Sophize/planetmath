  "statement": "*Simpson\u2019s rule* is a method of (approximate) numerical definite\nintegration (or quadrature). Simpson\u2019s rule is based on a parabolic\nmodel of the function to be integrated (in contrast to the trapezoidal\nmodel of the trapezoidal rule). Thus, a minimum of three points and\nthree function values are required. Here we take three equidistant\npoints: $x_0x_2$ the interval endpoints, $x_1=(x_0+x_2)/2$ the midpoint,\nand let $h=|b-a|/2$ the distance between each. The definite integral is\nthen approximated by:\n$$\\int_{x_0}^{x_2} f(x) dx \\approx I = \\frac{h}{3} (f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + f(x_2))$$\n\nWe can extend this to greater precision by breaking our target domain\ninto $n$ equal-length fragments. The quadrature is then the weighted sum\nof the above formula for every pair of adjacent regions, which works out\nfor even $n$ to\n$$I = \\frac{h}{3} (f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + \\cdots + 4f(x_{n-3}) + 2f(x_{n-2}) + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n))$$",
