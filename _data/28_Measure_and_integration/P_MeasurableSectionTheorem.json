  "statement": "Consider a Cartesian product $X\\times Y$ with projection map\n$\\pi_X\\colon X\\times Y\\to X$. Then, a *cross section* of a subset\n$S\\subseteq X\\times Y$ is a map $\\tau\\colon\\pi_X(S)\\to Y$ satisfying\n$(x,\\tau(x))\\in S$. The following theorem states that such cross\nsections can be chosen in a way. We use the notation\n$\\mathcal{F}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$ for the in order to distinguish it from\nthe product paving $\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ be a universally complete , $Y$ be a Polish space\nwith $\\mathcal{B}$, and $\\pi_X\\colon X\\times Y\\to X$ be the projection\nmap.\n\nFor any $\\mathcal{F}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$-analytic set $S$, then\n$\\pi_X(S)\\in \\mathcal{F}$ and there is a measurable map\n$\\tau\\colon \\pi_X(S)\\to Y$ such that $(x,\\tau(x))\\in S$ for all\n$x\\in \\pi_X(S)$.\n\nThe existence of a map satisfying $(x,\\tau(x))\\in S$ is no surprise, and\nindeed must exist by a simple application of the axiom of choice. The\nmain force of the theorem is that $\\tau$ may be taken to be measurable,\nwhich is not something that could be achieved by such basic use of\nchoice. In fact, the result fails to be true if either the universal\ncompleteness assumption for $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ or the requirement that\n$Y$ be a Polish space is dropped.\n\n![image](sectionpic)\n\nThis result has important applications to continuous-time stochastic\nprocesses, where the space $Y$ is taken to be the time index set,\nusually the set $\\mathbb{R}_+$ of nonnegative real numbers.\n\nConsider stochastic processes $(U_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ and\n$(V_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ defined on a probability space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$. Suppose that they were not equivalent\nso that, with positive probability, there is a time $t$ at which they\ndiffer. Then the projection $\\pi_\\Omega(S)$ of the set of times\n$S=\\{(t,\\omega)\\colon U_t(\\omega)\\not=V_t(\\omega)\\}$ has positive\nprobability. Consequently, the measurable section theorem guarantees the\nexistence of a random time $\\tau$ for which $U_\\tau\\not=V_\\tau$ with\npositive probability.\n\nLet $(U_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ and $(V_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ be jointly\nmeasurable stochastic processes defined on the probability space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$. If $$\\mathbb{P}(U_\\tau=V_\\tau)=1$$\nfor all random times $\\tau\\colon\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}_+$, then $U$ and $V$\nare equivalent processes.\n\nSo, continuous-time stochastic processes are fully determined up to\nequivalence by their values, neglecting zero probability sets, at random\ntimes. Note that the condition that $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$ be\nuniversally complete can be dropped from the statement, due to the fact\nthat any random variable $\\tau$ on the completion of a probability space\ncan be replaced by a random variable $\\tau^\\prime$ satisfying\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau=\\tau^\\prime)=1$.\n\nMore useful statements which apply to adapted processes, and allow\n$\\tau$ to be either a stopping time or a predictable stopping time, are\ngiven by the optional and predictable section theorems.",
