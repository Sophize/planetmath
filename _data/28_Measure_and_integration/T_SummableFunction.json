  "definition": "A measurable function $f : \\Omega \\to \\reals$ where\n$(\\Omega, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu)$ is a measure space is said to be\n[**summable**]{} if the Lebesgue integral of the absolute value of $f$\nexists and is finite, $$\\int_{\\Omega} |f| d\\mu < +\\infty$$ An\nalternative way of expressing this condition is to assert that\n$f \\in L^1(\\Omega)$.\n\nNote that some authors distinguish between integrable and summable: an\nintegrable function is one for which the above integral exists; a\nsummable function is one for which the integral exists and is finite.",
