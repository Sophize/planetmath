  "definition": "Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. A Borel measure $\\mu$ on $X$ is said to be\na *Radon measure* if it is:\n\n1.  finite on compact sets,\n\n2.  inner regular (tight),\n    $\\mu(A) = \\sup \\{\\mu (V) \\mid \\text{compact}\\ V \\subset A\\}$.\n\nA finite Radon measure satisfies\n$\\mu(A) = \\inf \\{\\mu(G) \\mid \\text{open}\\ G \\supset A\\}$.\n\nRadon measures are not necessarily locally finite, although this is the\ncase for locally compact and metric spaces. (Counterexample: spaces\nwhere only finite subsets are compact.)\n\nA *Radon space* is a topological space on which every finite Borel\nmeasure is a Radon measure, this is the case, e.g. for Polish spaces or\nHausdorff spaces that are continuous images of Polish spaces.\n\nRadon measures are the \u201cmost important class of measures on arbitrary\nHausdorff topological spaces\u201d (K\u00f6nig\u00a0[@koe97], p.xiv) and formed the\nbase of the development of integration theory by Bourbaki and Schwartz.\nIn particular for locally compact spaces one often *defines* Radon\nmeasures as linear functionals $\\mu$ on the space $C^c(X)$ of continuous\nfunctions with compact support (\u2018Riesz representation definition\u2019). Berg\n*et al.* give the following summary [@ber84], p. 62*f.*:\n\nGiven the finctional $\\mu$ one defines *set functions*, in fact Borel\nmeasures, the *outer measure* $\\mu^*$ and the *essential outer measure*\n$\\mu^\\bullet$ given by $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu^* (G) &= \\sup \\{\\mu(f) | f\\in C^c(X), 0 \\le f \\le 1_G\\} \\text{ for open }G\\subset X\\text{ and}\\\\\n\\mu^* (A) &= \\inf\\{\\mu^* (A \\cap K) | K \\in \\mathfrak{K} (X)\\} \\text{ for }A\\subset X,\\\\\n\\mu^\\bullet (A) &= \\sup \\{\\mu^*(A \\cap K) | K \\in \\mathfrak{K}(X)\\} \\text{ for }A\\subset X.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$\\mu^\\bullet$ is a Radon measure in our sense, while $\\mu^*$ is not\nalways Radon. For locally compact and $\\sigma$-compact spaces, however,\nboth coincide (on the Borel algebra) and are equivalent to our Radon\nmeasure. For general Hausdorff spaces, Bourbaki introduces\n$W^* (A) = \\sup \\{(W_K)(A\\cap K) | K\\in \\mathfrak{K}(X)\\}$, where W,\ncalled a *Radon premeasure*, associates a Radon measure $W_K$ to each\ncompact $K \\subset X$, with $W_K|L = W_L, L\\in\\mathfrak{K}$ . This is a\nRadon measure (on Borel sets), Bourbaki, however, calls it only so if it\nis in addition locally finite.\n\nConsider now Borel measures $\\nu : \\mathfrak{B}\\mapsto [0, \\infty]$\nwhich are\n\n-   finite on compact sets, $\\nu|\\mathfrak{K} <\\infty$,\n\n-   inner regular on the open sets,\n    $\\nu(G) = \\sup \\{\\nu(K)|K\\subset G\\}$ for $G$ open, and $K$ compact,\n\n-   outer regular, $\\nu(B) = \\inf \\{\\nu(G) | B\\subset G$ for open $G$\n    and Borel $B$.\n\nthen the measures $\\nu$ correspond bijectively to locally finite Radon\nmeasures $\\mu$ on $X$.\n\n[99]{} Christian Berg, Jens Peter Reus, Paul Ressel: Harmonic analysis\non semigroups. \u2013 Berlin, 1984 (Graduate Texts in Mathematics; 100) Heinz\nK\u00f6nig: Measure and integration\u00a0: an advanced course in basic procedures\nand applications.\u2013 Berlin, 1997.",
