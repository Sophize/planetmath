  "definition": "For each complex number $c$, there is an associated quadratic map\n$f_c\\colon\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}$ defined by $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$. Since\npolynomials are analytic, it follows that $f_c$ has a Julia set\n$J(f_c)$, which we call the *quadratic Julia set* associated to $c$ and\ndenote by $J_c$.\n\nThe function can also be viewed as having $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as its domain\nand codomain. If $c = a + ib$, then\n$$f_c(x, y) = (x^2 - y^2 + a, 2xy + b).$$ The characterization of the\nJulia set $J_c$ as all points $z$ for which the collection of iterates\n$\\{f^n\\colon n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is not a normal family can be roughly\ninterpreted as saying that the Julia set includes only those points\nexhibiting chaotic behavior. In particular, points whose orbit under $f$\ngoes to infinity are omitted from $J_c$, as well as points whose orbit\nconverges to a point.\n\nSometimes for aesthetic purposes a Julia set is displayed with points of\nthe latter type included. However, the chaoticity of the true Julia set\ncan be exploited to plot an approximation very quickly. Given a single\npoint $z$ known to be in the quadratic Julia set $J_c$, its inverses\nunder $f$, that is, the square roots of $z - c$, are also in $J_c$.\nMoreover, by the chaoticity condition the \u201cbackwards orbit\u201d of $z$\n(selecting just one square root at each step) will be distributed fairly\nevenly over $J_c$, so this gives a computationally inexpensive method to\nplot Julia sets.\n\nBefore the advent of computers, the French mathematician Gaston Julia\nproved under what conditions a Julia set is connected or not connected.\nAfter computers became available, it became possible to make pictures\ndisplaying some of the complexity of these Julia sets, and the\nMandelbrot set, a kind of index into connected quadratic Julia sets, was\ndiscovered.\n\nIn the same way that some people see recognizable shapes in clouds, some\npeople see recognizable shapes in Julia sets, and some of them have been\nnamed accordingly. To give two examples: the San Marco dragon at\n$\\frac{-3}{4} + 0i$ and the Douady rabbit at $\\frac{-1}{8} +\n\\frac{745}{1000}i$ (the coordinates can be varied by small values and\nstill give very similar shapes).\n\nJulia sets can be generalized to other iterated holomorphic functions on\nthe complex plane or in a 3-dimensional space.\n\n[1]{} H.
