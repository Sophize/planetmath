  "statement": "of a measurable space $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ do not, in general, have to be\nmeasurable. See, for example, . However, the following result is true.\n\nAll analytic subsets of a measurable space are universally measurable.\n\nTherefore for a universally complete measurable space $(X,\\mathcal{F})$\nall $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets are themselves in $\\mathcal{F}$ and, in\nparticular, this applies to any complete $(X,\\mathcal{F},\\mu)$. For\nexample, analytic subsets of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ are Lebesgue\nmeasurable.\n\nThe proof of the theorem follows as a consequence of the capacitability\ntheorem. Suppose that $A$ is an $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic set. Then, for\nany finite measure $\\mu$ on $(X,\\mathcal{F})$, let $\\mu^*$ be the outer\nmeasure generated by $\\mu$. This is an $\\mathcal{F}$-capacity and, by\nthe capacitability theorem, $A$ is $(\\mathcal{F},\\mu^*)$-capacitable,\nhence is in the completion of $\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\\mu$ (see\n). As this is true for all such finite measures, $A$ is universally\nmeasurable.",
