  "statement": "If $S$ is a finite set then any field of subsets of $S$ (see \u201cfield of\nsets\u201d in the entry on rings of sets) can be described as the set of\nunions of subsets of a partition of $S$.\n\nNote that, if $P$ is a partition of $S$ and $A,B \\subset P$, we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{\\bigcup A} &=& \\bigcup (P \\setminus A) \\\\\n(\\bigcup A) \\cup (\\bigcup B) &=& \\bigcup (A \\cup B) \\\\\n(\\bigcup A) \\cap (\\bigcup B) &=& \\bigcup (A \\cap B) \\\\\\end{aligned}$$ so\n$\\{ \\bigcup X \\mid X \\subset P \\}$ is a field of sets.\n\nNow assume that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a field of subsets of a finite set $S$.\nLet us define the set of \u201cprime elements\u201d of $\\mathcal{F}$ as follows:\n$$P = \\{ X \\in (\\mathcal{F} \\setminus {\\varnothing}) \\mid (Y \\subset X)\n \\wedge (Y \\in \\mathcal{F}) \\Rightarrow (Y = \\varnothing \\vee Y = X) \\}$$\nThe choice of terminology \u201cprime element\u201d is meant to be a suggestive\nmnemonic of how the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and the number\nitself.\n\nWe claim that $P$ is a partition. To justify this claim, we need to show\nthat elements of $P$ are pairwise disjoint and that $\\bigcup P =\nS$.\n\nSuppose that $A$ and $B$ are prime elements. Since, by definition, $A\n\\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ is a field of\nsets, $A \\cap B \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Since $A \\cap B \\subset A$, we must\neither have $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$ or $A \\cap B = A$. In the former\ncase, $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, whilst in the latter case $A =\nB$.\n\nSuppose that $x$ is any element of $S$. Then we claim that the set $X$\ndefined as $$X = \\bigcup \\{ Y \\in \\mathcal F \\mid x \\in Y \\}$$ is a\nprime element of $\\mathcal{F}$. To begin, note that, since $\\mathcal{F}$\nis finite, a forteriori any subset of $\\mathcal{F}$ is finite and, since\nfields of sets are assumed to be closed under intersection, it follows\nthat the intersection of a susbet of $\\mathcal{F}$ is an element of\n$\\mathcal{F}$, in particular $X \\in\n\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nSuppose that $Z \\subset X$ and $Z \\in \\mathcal{F}$. If $x \\notin Z$,\nthen $x \\in \\overline{Z}$. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is a field of sets,\n$\\overline{Z} \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Hence, by the construction of $X$, it is\nthe case that $X \\subset \\overline{Z}$, hence $X \\cap Z =\n\\varnothing$. Together with $Z \\subset X$, this implies $Z =\n\\varnothing$. If $x \\in Z$, then, by construction, $X \\subset Z$, which\nimplies $X = Z$.\n\nThus, we see that $X$ is a prime set. Since $x$ was arbitrarily chosen,\nthis means that every element of $S$ is contained in a prime element of\n$\\mathcal{F}$, so the union of all prime elements is $S$ itself.\nTogether with the previously shown fact that prime elements are pairwise\ndisjoint, this shows that the prime elements for a partition of $S$.\n\nLet $A$ be an arbitrary element of $\\mathcal{F}$. Since $P \\subset\n\\mathcal{F}$, it is the case that $(\\forall X \\in P) A \\cap X \\in\n\\mathcal{F}$. Since $P$ is a partition of $S$,\n$$A = \\bigcup \\{ A \\cap X \\mid X \\in P \\}$$ so every element of\n$\\mathcal{F}$ can be expressed as a union of elements of $P$.",
