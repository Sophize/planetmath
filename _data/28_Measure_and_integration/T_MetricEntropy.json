  "definition": "Let $(X,\\mathscr{B},\\mu)$ be a probability space, and $T\\colon X\\to X$ a\nmeasure-preserving transformation. The entropy of $T$ with respect to a\nfinite measurable partition $\\mathcal{P}$ is\n$$h_\\mu(T,\\mathcal{P})=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}H_\\mu\\left(\\bigvee_{k=0}^{n-1} T^{-k}\\mathcal{P}\\right),$$\nwhere $H_\\mu$ is the entropy of a partition and $\\vee$ denotes the join\nof partitions. The above limit always exists, although it can be\n$+\\infty$. The entropy of $T$ is then defined as\n$$h_\\mu(T) = \\sup_{\\mathcal{P}} h_\\mu(T,\\mathcal{P}),$$ with the\nsupremum taken over all finite measurable partitions. Sometimes\n$h_\\mu(T)$ is called the metric or measure theoretic entropy of $T$, to\ndifferentiate it from topological entropy.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  There is a natural correspondence between finite measurable\n    partitions and finite sub-$\\sigma$-algebras of $\\mathscr{B}$. Each\n    finite sub-$\\sigma$-algebra is generated by a unique partition, and\n    clearly each finite partition generates a finite $\\sigma$-algebra.\n    Because of this, sometimes $h_\\mu(T,\\mathcal{P})$ is called the\n    entropy of $T$ with respect to the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathscr{P}$\n    generated by $\\mathcal{P}$, and denoted by $h_\\mu(T,\\mathscr{P})$.\n    This simplifies the notation in some instances.",
