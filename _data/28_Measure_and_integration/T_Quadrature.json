  "definition": "*Quadrature* is the computation of a univariate definite integral. It\ncan refer to either numerical or analytic techniques; one must gather\nfrom context which is meant. The term refers to the geometric origin of\nintegration in determining the area of a plane figure by approximating\nit with squares.\n\n*Cubature* refers to higher-dimensional definite integral computation.\nLikewise, this term refers to the geometric operation of approximating\nthe volume of a solid by means of cubes (and has since been extended to\nhigher dimensions).\n\nThe terms \u201cquadrature\u201d and \u201ccubature\u201d are typically used in numerical\nanalysis to denote the approximation of a definite integral, typically\nby a suitable weighted sum. Perhaps the simplest possibility is\napproximation by a sum of values at equidistant points, i.e. approximate\n$\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx$ by $\\sum_{k=0}^n f(k/n) / n$. More complicated\napproximations involve variable weights and evaluation of the function\nat points which may not be spaced equidistantly. Some such numerical\nquadrature methods are Simpson\u2019s rule, the trapezoidal rule, and\nGaussian quadrature.",
