  "definition": "Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $\\mathcal{A}$ be a $\\sigma$-algebra on\n$X$. Also, let $\\mu$ be a non-negative measure defined on $\\mathcal{A}$.\nTwo complex valued functions $f$ and $g$ are said to be equal almost\neverywhere on $X$ (denoted as $f = g$ a.e. if\n$\\mu \\{x \\in X : f(x) \\ne g(x) \\} = 0.$ The relation of being equal\nalmost everywhere on $X$ defines an equivalence relation. It is a common\npractice in the integration theory to denote the equivalence class\ncontaining $f$ by $f$ itself. It is easy to see that if $f_1,f_2$ are\nequivalent and $g_1,g_2$ are equivalent, then $f_1 + g_1, f_2+g_2$ are\nequivalent, and $f_1  g_1, f_2g_2$ are equivalent. This naturally\ndefines addition and multiplication among the equivalent classes of such\nfunctions. For a measureable $f \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{C}$, we define\n$${\\left\\lVert f\\right\\rVert}_{\\text{ess}} = \\operatorname{inf}\\{M > 0 \\colon \\mu \\{x : |f(x)| > M\\} = 0\\},$$\ncalled the essential supremum of $|f|$ on $X$. Now we define,\n$$L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu) = \\{f : X \\to \\mathbb{C} : {\\left\\lVert f\\right\\rVert}_{\\text{ess}} < \\infty\\}.$$\nHere the elements of $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$ are equivalence classes.\n\n### Properties of $L^\\infty(X,\\mu)$ {#properties-of-linftyxmu .unnumbered}\n\n1.  The space $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$ is a normed linear space with the norm\n    ${\\left\\lVert \\cdot\\right\\rVert}_{\\text{ess}}$. Also, the metric\n    defined by the norm is complete, making $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$, a\n    Banach space.\n\n2.  $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$ is the dual of $L^1(X,\\mu)$ if $X$ is\n    $\\sigma$-finite.\n\n3.  $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$ is closed under pointwise multiplication, and\n    with this multiplication it becomes an algebra. Further,\n    $L^{\\infty}(X,\\mu)$ is also a with the involution defined by\n    $f^*(x) = \\overline{f(x)}$. Since this $C^*$-algebra is also a dual\n    of some Banach space, it is called von Neumann algebra.",
