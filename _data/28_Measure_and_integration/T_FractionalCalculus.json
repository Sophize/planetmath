  "definition": "The idea of calculus in fractional order is nearly as old as its integer\ncounterpart. In a letter dated September 30th 1650, l\u2019H\u00f4pital posed the\nquestion of the meaning of $\\displaystyle{\\frac{d^\\alpha f}{dx^\\alpha}}$\nif $\\displaystyle{\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}}$ to Leibniz. There are different\napproaches to define calculus of fractional order. The following\napproaches are the most common and we can prove that they are equivalent\n\n\\(1) Riemann-Liouville approach of fractional integration\n\n\\(2) Grunwald-Letnikov approach of fractional differentiation",
