  "statement": "Any can be extended to a set function on the power set of the underlying\nspace. As the following result states, this will be a Choquet capacity.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{F},\\mu)$ be a finite measure space. Then,\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\mu^*\\colon\\mathcal{P}(X)\\to\\mathbb{R}_+,\\\\\n&\\mu^*(S)=\\inf\\left\\{\\mu(A)\\colon A\\in\\mathcal{F},\\ A\\supseteq S\\right\\} \\end{aligned}$$\nis an $\\mathcal{F}$-capacity. Furthermore, a subset $S\\subseteq X$ is\n$(\\mathcal{F},\\mu^*)$-capacitable if and only if it is in the of\n$\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\\mu$.\n\nNote that, as well as being a capacity, $\\mu^*$ is also an outer measure\n(see ), which does not require the finiteness of $\\mu$. Clearly,\n$\\mu^*(A)=\\mu(A)$ for all $A\\in\\mathcal{F}$, so $\\mu^*$ is an extension\nof $\\mu$ to the power set of $X$, and is referred to as the *outer\nmeasure generated by $\\mu$*.\n\nRecall that a subset $S\\subseteq X$ is in the completion of\n$\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\\mu$ if and only if there are sets\n$A,B\\in\\mathcal{F}$ with $A\\subseteq S\\subseteq B$ and\n$\\mu(B\\setminus A)=0$ which, by the above theorem, is equivalent to the\ncapacitability of $S$.",
