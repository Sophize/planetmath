  "definition": "There are several ways of defining a fractal, and a reader will need to\nreference their source to see which definition is being used.\n\nPerhaps the simplest definition is to define a *fractal* to be a subset\nof $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with Hausdorff dimension greater than its Lebesgue\ncovering dimension. It is worth noting that typically (but not always),\nfractals have non-integer Hausdorff dimension. See, for example, the\nKoch snowflake and the Mandelbrot set (named after Benoit Mandelbrot,\nwho also coined the term \u201cfractal\u201d for these objects).\n\nA looser definition of a *fractal* is a \u201cself-similar object\u201d. That is,\na subset or ${\\mathbb R}^n$ which can be covered by copies of itself\nusing a set of (usually two or more) transformation mappings. Another\nway to say this would be \u201can object with a discrete approximate scaling\nsymmetry\u201d.\n\nSee also the discussion near the end of the entry .",
