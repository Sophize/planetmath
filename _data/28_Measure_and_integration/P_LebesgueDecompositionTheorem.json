There exist two signed measures\n$\\nu_0$ and $\\nu_1$ such that:\n\n1.  $\\nu=\\nu_0+\\nu_1$;\n\n2.  $\\nu_0\\ll\\mu$ (i.e. $\\nu_0$ is absolutely continuous with respect to\n    $\\mu$;)\n\n3.  $\\nu_1\\perp\\mu$ (i.e. $\\nu_1$ and $\\mu$ are singular.)\n\nThese two measures are uniquely determined.",
