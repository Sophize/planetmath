  "statement": "The monotone class theorem is a result in measure theory which allows\nstatements about particularly simple classes of functions to be\ngeneralized to arbitrary measurable and bounded functions.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and $\\mathcal{S}$ be a\ngenerating the $\\mathcal{A}$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{H}$ be a vector\nspace of real-valued functions on $X$ containing the constant functions\nand satisfying the following,\n\n-   if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is bounded and there is a\n    sequence of nonnegative functions $f_n\\in \\mathcal{H}$ increasing\n    pointwise to $f$, then $f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\n-   for every set $A\\in\\mathcal{S}$ the characteristic function $1_A$ is\n    in $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{H}$ contains every bounded and measurable function from\n$X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThat $\\mathcal{H}$ is a vector space just means that it is closed under\ntaking linear combinations, so $\\lambda f+\\mu g\\in \\mathcal{H}$ whenever\n$f,g\\in\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAs an example application, consider , which states that for any two\nfinite measure spaces $(X,\\mathcal{A},\\mu)$ and $(Y,\\mathcal{B},\\nu)$\nthen we may commute the order of integration $$\\label{eq:1}\n\\int\\int f(x,y)\\,d\\mu(x)\\,d\\nu(y)=\\int\\int f(x,y)\\,d\\nu(y)\\,d\\mu(x).$$\nHere, $f\\colon X\\times Y\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded and\n$\\mathcal{A}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$-measurable function. The space\n$\\mathcal{H}$ of functions for which this identity holds is easily shown\nto be linearly closed and, by the monotone convergence theorem, is\nclosed under taking monotone limits of functions. Furthermore, the\n$\\pi$-system of sets of the form $A\\times B$ for $A\\in\\mathcal{A}$,\n$B\\in\\mathcal{B}$ generates the $\\sigma$-algebra\n$\\mathcal{A}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$ and\n$$\\int\\int 1_{A\\times B}(x,y)\\,d\\mu(x)\\,d\\nu(y)=\\mu(A)\\nu(B)=\\int\\int 1_{A\\times B}(x,y)\\,d\\nu(y)\\,d\\mu(x).$$\nSo, $1_{A\\times B}\\in \\mathcal{H}$ and the monotone class theorem allows\nus to conclude that all real valued and bounded\n$\\mathcal{A}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$-measurable functions are in\n$\\mathcal{H}$, and equation (\\[eq:1\\]) is satisfied.\n\nAn alternative, more general form of the monotone class theorem is as\nfollows. The version of the monotone class theorem given above follows\nfrom this by letting $\\mathcal{K}$ be the characteristic functions $1_A$\nfor $A\\in\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n\\[thm:2\\] Let $X$ be a set and $\\mathcal{K}$ be a collection of bounded\nand real valued functions on $X$ which is closed under multiplication,\nso that $fg\\in\\mathcal{K}$ for all $f,g\\in\\mathcal{K}$. Let\n$\\mathcal{A}$ be the $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ generated by $\\mathcal{K}$.\n\nSuppose that $\\mathcal{H}$ is a vector space of real valued functions on\n$X$ containing $\\mathcal{K}$ and the constant functions, and satisfying\nthe following\n\n-   if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is bounded and there is a\n    sequence of nonnegative functions $f_n\\in \\mathcal{H}$ increasing\n    pointwise to $f$, then $f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{H}$ contains every bounded and real valued\n$\\mathcal{A}$-measurable function on $X$.\n\nSaying that $\\mathcal{A}$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by\n$\\mathcal{K}$ means that it is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra containing\nthe sets $f^{-1}(B)$ for $f\\in\\mathcal{K}$ and Borel subset $B$ of\n$\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor example, letting $\\mathcal{K}$ be as in theorem \\[thm:2\\] and\n$\\mu,\\nu$ be finite measures on $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ such that\n$\\mu(X)=\\nu(X)$ and $\\int f\\,d\\mu=\\int f\\,d\\nu$ for all\n$f\\in\\mathcal{K}$, then $\\int f\\,d\\mu=\\int f\\,d\\nu$ for all bounded and\nmeasurable real valued functions $f$. Therefore, $\\mu=\\nu$. In\nparticular, a finite measure $\\mu$ on\n$(\\mathbb{R},\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}))$ is uniquely determined by its\ncharacteristic function $\\chi(x)\\equiv\\int e^{ixy}\\,d\\mu(y)$ for\n$x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, a finite measure $\\mu$ on a bounded\ninterval is uniquely determined by the integrals $\\int x^{n}\\,d\\mu(x)$\nfor $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$.",
