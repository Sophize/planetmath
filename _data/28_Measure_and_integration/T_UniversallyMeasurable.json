  "definition": "Given a measurable space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$, a subset\n$S\\subseteq\\Omega$ is said to be *universally measurable* if it lies in\nthe of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to every finite\nmeasure $\\mu$ on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$. That is, for every such $\\mu$,\nthere exist $A,B\\in\\mathcal{F}$ such that $A\\subseteq S\\subseteq B$ and\n$\\mu(B\\setminus A)=0$.\n\nIf, for any finite measure $\\mu$ we denote the completion of\n$\\mathcal{F}$ by $\\mathcal{F}^*_\\mu$ then, the collection of universally\nmeasurable sets is $$\\mathcal{F}^*=\\bigcap_\\mu\\mathcal{F}^*_\\mu$$ where\n$\\mu$ ranges over the finite measures on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$. Being\nan intersection of $\\sigma$-algebras, the collection $\\mathcal{F}^*$ of\nuniversally measurable sets is itself a $\\sigma$-algebra, and is called\nthe *universal completion* of $\\mathcal{F}$. The $\\sigma$-algebra\n$\\mathcal{F}$ is called *universally complete* if it contains every set\nwhich is universally measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}$. That is,\nif $\\mathcal{F}^*=\\mathcal{F}$. The universal completion of a\n$\\sigma$-algebra is itself universally complete.\n\nA function $f\\colon A\\rightarrow B$ between measurable spaces\n$(A,\\mathcal{A})$ and $(B,\\mathcal{B})$ is said to be universally\nmeasurable if it is $\\mathcal{A}^*/\\mathcal{B}^*$-measurable, so that\n$f^{-1}(S)\\in\\mathcal{A}^*$ for all $S\\in\\mathcal{B}^*$. In fact, this\nis equivalent to requiring that $f$ be\n$\\mathcal{A}^*/\\mathcal{B}$-measurable so, in particular, every\nmeasurable function is universally measurable.\n\nAs , the term \u201cfinite measure\u201d may be replaced by \u201c$\\sigma$-finite\nmeasure\u201d in the definitions above. In particular, every $\\sigma$-finite\nmeasure $\\mu$ on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$ can be uniquely extended to the\nuniversal completion of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nA subset of a topological space $X$ is said to be universally measurable\nif it is universally measurable with respect to the Borel\n$\\sigma$-algebra on $X$. It can be shown, for example, that the image of\nany continuous map between Polish spaces is universally measurable.\n\nAn important example of the use of universally measurable functions\ncomes from the theory of continuous-time stochastic processes. The first\ntime that a continuous process hits a given value is a universally\nmeasurable time, as stated by the d\u00e9but theorem. However, it is not\nalways measurable.\n\nIt is well known that the axiom of choice is required to construct\nnon-Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and, it can be shown\nthat this statement extends to all universally measurable subsets of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$. That is, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory,\nwithout the axiom of choice, are consistent with the statement that all\nsubsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are universally measurable. This remains true\neven if we allow a weaker version of the AOC, in the form of the axiom\nof dependent choice.\n\nAs every universally measurable subset of the real numbers is Lebesgue\nmeasurable, the proof of Vitali\u2019s Theorem gives an example of the use of\nthe axiom of choice to construct a non-universally measurable set. It is\nalso possible to construct without using the axiom of choice.",
