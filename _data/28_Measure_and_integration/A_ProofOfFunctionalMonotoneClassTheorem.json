  "argumentText": "We start by proving the following version of the monotone class theorem.\n\n\\[thm:1\\] Let $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and $\\mathcal{S}$\nbe a generating the $\\mathcal{A}$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{H}$ be a\nvector space of real-valued functions on $X$ containing the constant\nfunctions and satisfying the following,\n\n-   if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_+$ is bounded and there is a\n    sequence of nonnegative functions $f_n\\in \\mathcal{H}$ increasing\n    pointwise to $f$, then $f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\n-   for every set $A\\in\\mathcal{S}$ the characteristic function $1_A$ is\n    in $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{H}$ contains every bounded and measurable function from\n$X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{D}$ consist of the collection of subsets $B$ of $X$ such\nthat the characteristic function $1_B$ is in $\\mathcal{H}$. Then, by the\nconditions of the theorem, the constant function $1_X$ is in $V$ so that\n$X\\in\\mathcal{D}$, and $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq\\mathcal{D}$. For any\n$A\\subseteq B$ in $\\mathcal{D}$ then\n$1_{B\\setminus A}=1_B-1_A\\in \\mathcal{H}$, as $\\mathcal{H}$ is closed\nunder linear combinations, and therefore $B\\setminus A$ is in\n$\\mathcal{D}$. If $A_n\\in\\mathcal{D}$ is an increasing sequence, then\n$1_{A_n}\\in \\mathcal{H}$ increases pointwise to $1_{\\bigcup_nA_n}$,\nwhich is therefore in $\\mathcal{H}$, and $\\bigcup_nA_n\\in\\mathcal{D}$.\nIt follows that $\\mathcal{D}$ is a Dynkin system, and Dynkin\u2019s lemma\nshows that it contains the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have shown that $1_A\\in \\mathcal{H}$ for every $A\\in\\mathcal{A}$. Now\nconsider any bounded and measurable function\n$f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ taking values in a finite set\n$S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$. Then, $$f=\\sum_{s\\in S} s1_{f^{-1}(\\{s\\})}$$ is\nin $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\nWe denote the floor function by $\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor$. That is,\n$\\lfloor a\\rfloor$ is defined to be the largest integer less than or\nequal to the real number $a$. Then, for any nonnegative bounded and\nmeasurable $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, the sequence of functions\n$f_n(x)=2^{-n}\\lfloor 2^n f(x)\\rfloor$ each take values in a finite set,\nso are in $\\mathcal{H}$, and increase pointwise to $f$. So,\n$f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\nFinally, as every measurable and bounded function\n$f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ can be written as the difference of its\npositive and negative parts $f=f_+-f_-$, then $f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\nWe now extend this result to prove the following more general form of\nthe theorem.\n\n\\[thm:2\\] Let $X$ be a set and $\\mathcal{K}$ be a collection of bounded\nand real valued functions on $X$ which is closed under multiplication,\nso that $fg\\in\\mathcal{K}$ for all $f,g\\in\\mathcal{K}$. Let\n$\\mathcal{A}$ be the $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ generated by $\\mathcal{K}$.\n\nSuppose that $\\mathcal{H}$ is a vector space of bounded real valued\nfunctions on $X$ containing $\\mathcal{K}$ and the constant functions,\nand satisfying the following\n\n-   if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is bounded and there is a\n    sequence of nonnegative functions $f_n\\in \\mathcal{H}$ increasing\n    pointwise to $f$, then $f\\in \\mathcal{H}$.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{H}$ contains every bounded and real valued\n$\\mathcal{A}$-measurable function on $X$.\n\nLet us start by showing that $\\mathcal{H}$ is closed under uniform\nconvergence. That is, if $f_n$ is a sequence in $\\mathcal{H}$ and\n$\\Vert f_n-f\\Vert \\equiv \\sup_x|f_n(x)-f(x)|$ converges to zero, then\n$f\\in\\mathcal{H}$. By passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may\nassume that $\\Vert f_n-f_m\\Vert\\le 2^{-n}$ for all $m\\ge n$. Define\n$g_n\\equiv f_n-2^{1-n}+2+\\Vert f\\Vert$. Then $g_n\\in\\mathcal{H}$ since\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is a vector space containing the constant functions. Also,\n$g_n$ are nonnegative functions increasing pointwise to\n$f+2+\\Vert f\\Vert$ which must therefore be in $\\mathcal{H}$, showing\nthat $f\\in\\mathcal{H}$ as required.\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{H}_0$ consist of linear combinations of constant\nfunctions and functions in $\\mathcal{K}$ and $\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ be its\nunder uniform convergence. Then $\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0\\subseteq\\mathcal{H}$\nsince we have just shown that $\\mathcal{H}$ is closed under uniform\nconvergence. As $\\mathcal{K}$ is already closed under products,\n$\\mathcal{H}_0$ and $\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ will also be closed under\nproducts, so are . In particular, $p(f)\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ for every\n$f\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ and polynomial $p\\in\\mathbb{R}[X]$. Then, for\nany continuous function $p\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, the\nWeierstrass approximation theorem says that there is a sequence of\npolynomials $p_n$ converging uniformly to $p$ on bounded intervals, so\n$p_n(f)\\rightarrow p(f)$ uniformly. It follows that\n$p(f)\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$. In particular, the minimum of any two\nfunctions $f,g\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$, $f\\wedge g = f-|f-g|$ and the\nmaximum $f\\vee g=f+|g-f|$ will be in $\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$.\n\nWe let $\\mathcal{S}$ consist of the sets $A\\subseteq X$ such that there\nis a sequence of nonnegative $f_n\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ increasing\npointwise to $1_A$. Once it is shown that this is a $\\pi$-system\ngenerating the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A}$, then the result will\nfollow from theorem \\[thm:1\\].\n\nIf $f_n,g_n\\in\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ are nonnegative functions increasing\npointwise to $1_A,1_B$ then $f_ng_n$ increases pointwise to\n$1_{A\\cap B}$, so $A\\cap B\\in\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$ is a\n$\\pi$-system.\n\nFinally, choose any $f\\in\\mathcal{K}$ and $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Then,\n$f_n=((n(f-a))\\vee 0)\\wedge 1$ is a sequence of functions in\n$\\mathcal{\\bar H}_0$ increasing pointwise to $1_{f^{-1}((a,\\infty))}$.\nSo, $f^{-1}((a,\\infty))\\in\\mathcal{S}$. As intervals of the form\n$(a,\\infty)$ generate the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$, it\nfollows that $\\mathcal{S}$ generates the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A}$,\nas required.",
