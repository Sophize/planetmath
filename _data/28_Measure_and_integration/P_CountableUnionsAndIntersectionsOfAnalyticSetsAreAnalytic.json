  "statement": "A property of which makes them particularly suited to applications in\nmeasure theory is that, in common with , they are closed under countable\nunions and intersections.\n\n\\[thm:1\\] Let $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ be a paved space and\n$(A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets.\nThen, $\\bigcup_nA_n$ and $\\bigcap_n A_n$ are $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic.\n\nA consequence of this is that measurable sets are analytic, as follows.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be a nonempty paving on a set $X$ such that the of any\n$S\\in\\mathcal{F}$ is a union of countably many sets in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThen, every set $A$ in the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{F}$\nis $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic.\n\nFor example, every closed subset of a metric space $X$ is a union of\ncountably many open sets. Therefore, the corollary shows that all Borel\nsets are analytic with respect to the open subsets of $X$.\n\nThat the corollary does indeed follow from Theorem \\[thm:1\\] is a simple\napplication of the monotone class theorem. First, as the collection\n$a(\\mathcal{F})$ of $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic sets is closed under\ncountable unions and finite intersections, it will contain all finite\nunions of finite intersections of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ and their\ncomplements, which is an . Then, Theorem \\[thm:1\\] says that\n$a(\\mathcal{F})$ is closed under taking limits of increasing and\ndecreasing sequences of sets. So, by the monotone class theorem, it\ncontains the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{F}$.",
