  "definition": "Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n============\n\nGiven a real number $\\alpha\\ge 0$ we are going to define a Borel\nexternal measure ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha$ on ${\\mathbb R}^n$ with values in\n$[0,+\\infty]$ which will comprehend and generalize the concepts of\nlength (for $\\alpha=1$), area ($\\alpha=2$) and volume ($\\alpha=3$) of\nsets in ${\\mathbb R}^n$. In particular if $M\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ is an\n$m$-dimensional regular surface then one will show that\n${\\mathcal H}^m(M)$ is the $m$-dimensional area of $M$. However, being\nan external measure, ${\\mathcal H}^m$ is defined not only on regular\nsurfaces but on every subset of ${\\mathbb R}^n$ thus generalizing the\nconcepts of length, area and volume. In particular, for $m=n$, it turns\nout that the Hausdorff measure ${\\mathcal H}^n$ is nothing else than the\nLebesgue measure of ${\\mathbb R}^n$.\n\nGiven any fixed set $E\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ one can consider the\nmeasures ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha(E)$ with $\\alpha$ varying in\n$[0,+\\infty)$. We will see that for a fixed set $E$ there exists at most\none value $\\alpha$ such that ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha(E)$ is finite and\npositive; while for every other value $\\beta$ one will have\n${\\mathcal H}^\\beta(E)=0$ if $\\beta>\\alpha$ and\n${\\mathcal H}^\\beta(E)=+\\infty$ if $\\beta<\\alpha$. For example, if $E$\nis a regular $2$-dimensional surface then only ${\\mathcal H}^2(E)$\n(which is the area of the surface) may possibly be finite and different\nfrom $0$ while, for example, the volume of $E$ will be $0$ and the\nlength of $E$ will be infinite.\n\nThis can be used to define the dimension of a set $E$ (this is called\nthe Hausdorff dimension). A very interesting fact is the existence of\nsets with dimension $\\alpha$ which is not integer, as happens for most\n*fractals*.\n\nAlso, the measure ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha$ is naturally defined on every\nmetric space $(X,d)$, not only on ${\\mathbb R}^n$.\n\nDefinition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nLet $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Given $E\\subset X$ we define the diameter\nof $E$ as $$\\mathrm{diam}(E) := \\sup_{x,y\\in E} d(x,y).$$ Given a real\nnumber $\\alpha$ we consider the conventional constant\n$$\\omega_\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi^{\\alpha/2}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha/2+1)}$$ where\n$\\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function.\n\nFor all $\\delta>0$, $\\alpha\\ge 0$ and $E\\subset X$ let us define\n$$\\label{defHdelta}\n  {\\mathcal H}^\\alpha_\\delta(E) := \\inf \\left\\{\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\omega_\\alpha \\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{diam}}(B_j)} 2\\right)^\\alpha\n\\colon B_j\\subset X,\\ \\bigcup_{j=0}^\\infty B_j\\supset E,\\ \n{\\mathrm{diam}}(B_j) \\le \\delta\\ \\forall j=0,1,\\ldots\n\\right\\}.$$ The *infimum* is taken over all possible enumerable families\nof sets $B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_j,\\ldots$ which are sufficiently small\n(${\\mathrm{diam}}B_j \\le \\delta$) and which cover $E$.\n\nNotice that the function ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha_\\delta(E)$ is decreasing\nin $\\delta$. In fact given $\\delta'>\\delta$ the family of sequences\n$B_j$ considered in the definition of ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha_{\\delta'}$\ncontains the family of sequences considered in the definition of\n${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha_\\delta$ and hence the infimum is smaller. So the\nlimit in the following definition exists: $$\\label{defH}\n{\\mathcal H}^\\alpha(E):=\\lim_{\\delta\\to 0^+} {\\mathcal H}^\\alpha_\\delta(E).$$\nThe number ${\\mathcal H}^\\alpha(E)\\in [0,+\\infty]$ is called\n*$\\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure* of the set $E\\subset X$.",
