  "statement": "Let $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$ be a measure space. Then, a\nuniformly integrable set $S$ of measurable functions\n$f\\colon\\Omega\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ will remain uniformly integrable if\nit is enlarged by various operations, such as taking convex combinations\nand conditional expectations. The following theorem lists some of the\noperations which preserve uniform integrability.\n\nSuppose that $S$ is a bounded and uniformly integrable subset of $L^1$.\nLet $S^\\prime$ be the smallest set containing $S$ such that all of the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied. Then, $S^\\prime$ is also a bounded\nand uniformly integrable subset of $L^1$.\n\n1.  $S^\\prime$ is absolutely convex. That is, if $f,g\\in S^\\prime$ and\n    $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ are such that $|a|+|b|\\le 1$ then\n    $a f+b g\\in S^\\prime$.\n\n2.  If $f\\in S^\\prime$ and $|g|\\le |f|$ then $g\\in S^\\prime$.\n\n3.  $S^\\prime$ is closed under convergence in measure. That is, if\n    $f_n\\in S^\\prime$ converge in measure to $f$, then $f\\in S^\\prime$.\n\n4.  If $f\\in S^\\prime$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ is a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra of\n    $\\mathcal{F}$ such that $\\mu\\vert_\\mathcal{G}$ is $\\sigma$-finite,\n    then the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}_\\mu[f\\mid\\mathcal{G}]$\n    is in $S^\\prime$.\n\nTo prove this we use the condition that the set $S$ is uniformly\nintegrable if and only if there is a convex and symmetric function\n$\\Phi\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow[0,\\infty)$ such that\n$\\Phi(x)/|x|\\rightarrow\\infty$ as $|x|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and\n$$\\int\\Phi(f)\\,d\\mu$$ is bounded over all $f\\in S$ (see equivalent\nconditions for uniform integrability). Suppose that it is bounded by\n$K>0$. Also, by replacing $\\Phi$ by $\\Phi(x)+|x|$ if necessary, we may\nsuppose that $\\Phi(x)\\ge |x|$. Then, let $\\bar S$ be\n$$\\bar S=\\left\\{ f\\in L^1:\\int\\Phi(f)\\,d\\mu\\le K\\right\\},$$ which is a\nbounded and uniformly integrable subset of $L^1$ containing $S$. To\nprove the result, it just needs to be shown that $\\bar S$ is closed\nunder each of the operations listed above, as that will imply\n$S^\\prime\\subseteq\\bar S$.\n\nFirst, the convexity and symmetry of $\\Phi$ gives\n$$\\int\\Phi(a f+b g)\\,d\\mu \\le \\int\\left(|a|\\Phi(f)+|b|\\Phi(g)\\right)\\,d\\mu\n=|a|\\int\\Phi(f)\\,d\\mu+|b|\\int\\Phi(g)\\,d\\mu\\le K$$ for any\n$f,g\\in\\bar{S}$ and $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ with $|a|+|b|\\le 1$. So,\n$af+bg\\in\\bar{S}$. Similarly, if $|g|\\le |f|$ and $f\\in\\bar{S}$ then\n$\\Phi(g)\\le\\Phi(f)$ and, $g\\in\\bar{S}$.\n\nNow suppose that $f_n\\in\\bar{S}$ converge in measure to $f$. Then\nFatou\u2019s lemma gives,\n$$\\int\\Phi(f)\\,d\\mu\\le\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\int\\Phi(f_n)\\,d\\mu\\le K$$\nso, $f\\in\\bar S$.\n\nFinally suppose that $f\\in\\bar S$ and\n$g=\\mathbb{E}_\\mu[f\\mid\\mathcal{G}]$. Using Jensen\u2019s inequality,\n$$\\int \\Phi(g)\\,d\\mu\\le \\int \\mathbb{E}_\\mu[\\Phi(f)\\mid\\mathcal{G}]\\,d\\mu=\\int\\Phi(f)\\,d\\mu\\le K,$$\nso $g\\in\\bar S$.",
