  "statement": "This entry should not be mistaken with the entry on the Riesz\nrepresentation theorem of linear functionals on an Hilbert space.\n\nThe Riesz provided here basically that linear functionals on certain\nspaces of functions can be seen as integration against measures. In\nother , for some spaces of functions all linear functionals have the\nform $$f \\longmapsto \\int f\\; d\\mu$$ for some measure $\\mu$.\n\nThere are many versions of these Riesz , and which version is used\ndepends upon the generality wishes to achieve, the difficulty of proof,\nthe of space of functions involved, the of linear functionals involved,\nthe of the \u201c\u201d space involved, and also the of measures involved.\n\nWe present here some possible Riesz of general use.\n\n[**Notation -**]{} In the following we adopt the following conventions:\n\n-   $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n-   $C_c(X)$ denotes the space of real valued continuous functions on\n    $X$ with compact support.\n\n-   $C_0(X)$ denotes the space of real valued continuous functions on\n    $X$ that vanish at infinity.\n\n-   all function spaces are endowed with the sup-norm $\\|.\\|_{\\infty}$\n\n-   a linear functional $L$ is said to be if $0 \\leq L(f)$ whenever\n    $0 \\leq f$.\n\n[**Theorem 1 (Riesz-Markov) -**]{} Let $L$ be a positive linear\nfunctional on $C_c(X)$. There exists a unique Radon measure $\\mu$ on\n$X$, whose underlying is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by all compact\nsets, such that $$L(f) = \\int_X f \\; d\\mu$$ Moreover, $\\mu$ is finite if\nand only if $L$ is bounded.\n\nNotice that when $X$ is the underlying $\\sigma$-algebra for these\nmeasures is precisely the of $X$.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[**Theorem 2 -**]{} Let $L$ be a positive linear functional on $C_0(X)$.\nThere exists a unique finite Radon measure $\\mu$ on $X$ such that\n$$L(f) = \\int_X f \\; d\\mu$$\n\n[**Theorem 3 (Dual of $C_0(X)$) -**]{} Let $L$ be a linear functional on\n$C_0(X)$. There exists a unique finite Borel measure on $X$ such that\n$$L(f) = \\int_X f \\; d\\mu$$\n\n### Complex version:\n\nHere $C_0(X)$ denotes the space of complex valued continuous functions\non $X$ that vanish at infinity.\n\n[**Theorem 4 -**]{} Let $L$ be a linear functional on $C_0(X)$.
