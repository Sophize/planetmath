  "statement": "In measure theory, Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s extension theorem is an important\nresult used in the construction of measures, such as the Lebesgue\nmeasure on the real number line. The result states that a set function\non an algebra of sets can be extended to a measure on the generated by\nthat algebra.\n\nLet $X$ be a set, $A$ be an algebra on $X$, and\n$\\mathcal{A}\\equiv\\sigma(A)$ be the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $A$.\nIf $\\mu_0\\colon A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_+\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is a countably\nadditive map then there exists a measure $\\mu$ on $(X,\\mathcal{A})$ such\nthat $\\mu=\\mu_0$ on $A$.\n\n[9]{} David Williams, *Probability with martingales*, Cambridge\nMathematical Textbooks, Cambridge University Press, 1991.
