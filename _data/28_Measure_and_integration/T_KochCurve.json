  "definition": "A Koch curve is a fractal generated by a replacement rule. This rule is,\nat each step, to replace the middle $1/3$ of each line segment with two\nsides of a right triangle having sides of length equal to the replaced\nsegment. Two applications of this rule on a single line segment gives\nus:\n\n![image](koch1)\n\nTo generate the Koch curve, the rule is applied indefinitely, with a\nstarting line segment. Note that, if the length of the initial line\nsegment is $l$, the length $L_K$ of the Koch curve at the $n$th step\nwill be\n\n$$L_K = \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)^n l$$\n\nThis quantity increases without bound; hence the Koch curve has infinite\nlength. However, the curve still bounds a finite area. We can prove this\nby noting that in each step, we add an amount of area equal to the area\nof all the equilateral triangles we have just created. We can bound the\narea of each triangle of side length $s$ by $s^2$ (the square containing\nthe triangle.) Hence, at step $n$, the area $A_K$ \u201cunder\u201d the Koch curve\n(assuming $l=1$) is\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n A_K & < & \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + 3 \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^2 + 9 \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)^2 +  \\cdots \\\\ \n & = & \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{3^{i-1}} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nbut this is a geometric series of ratio less than one, so it converges.\nHence a Koch curve has infinite length and bounds a finite area.\n\nA Koch snowflake is the figure generated by applying the Koch\nreplacement rule to an equilateral triangle indefinitely.",
