  "statement": "Dynkin\u2019s lemma is a result in measure theory showing that the generated\nby any given on a set $X$ coincides with the Dynkin system generated the\n$\\pi$-system. The result can be used to prove that measures are uniquely\ndetermined by their values on $\\pi$-systems generating the required\n$\\sigma$-algebra. For example, the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on\n$\\mathbb{R}$ is generated by the $\\pi$-system of open intervals $(a,b)$\nfor $a<b$ and consequently the Lebesgue measure $\\mu$ is uniquely\ndetermined by the property that $\\mu( (a,b) )=b-a$.\n\nNote that this lemma generalizes the statement that a Dynkin system\nwhich is also a $\\pi$-system is a $\\sigma$-algebra.\n\nLet $A$ be a $\\pi$-system on a set $X$. Then $\\mathcal{D}(A)=\\sigma(A)$.\nThat is, the smallest Dynkin system containing $A$ coincides with the\n$\\sigma$-algebra generated by $A$.\n\nAs $A$ is a $\\pi$-system, the set\n$\\mathcal{D}_1\\equiv\\{S\\subseteq X:S\\cap T\\in \\mathcal{D}(A)\\text{ for every }T\\in A\\}$\ncontains $A$. We show that $\\mathcal{D}_1$ is also a Dynkin system.\n\nFirst, for every $T\\in A$, $X\\cap T=T\\in A$ so $X$ is in\n$\\mathcal{D}_1$. Second, if $S_1\\subseteq S_2$ are in $\\mathcal{D}_1$\nand $T\\in A$ then\n$(S_2\\setminus S_1)\\cap T = (S_2\\cap T)\\setminus(S_1\\cap T)$ is in\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ showing that $S_2\\setminus S_1\\in\\mathcal{D}_1$.\nFinally. if $S_n\\in\\mathcal{D}_1$ is a sequence increasing to\n$S\\subseteq X$ and $T\\in A$ then $S_n\\cap T$ is a sequence in\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ increasing to $S\\cap T$. As Dynkin systems are closed\nunder limits of increasing sequences this shows that\n$S\\cap T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$ and therefore $S\\in\\mathcal{D}_1$. So\n$\\mathcal{D}_1$ is indeed a Dynkin system. In particular,\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)\\subseteq\\mathcal{D}_1$ and $S\\cap T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$\nfor all $S\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$ and $T\\in A$.\n\nWe now set\n$\\mathcal{D}_2\\equiv\\{S\\subseteq X:S\\cap T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)\\text{ for every }T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)\\}$\nwhich, as shown above, contains $A$. Also, as in the argument above for\n$\\mathcal{D}_1$, $\\mathcal{D}_2$ is a Dynkin system. Therefore,\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}_2$ and it follows that\n$S\\cap T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$ for any $S,T\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$. So\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is both a $\\pi$-system and a Dynkin system.\n\nWe can now show that $\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra. As it is a\nDynkin system, $S^c=X\\setminus S\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$ for every\n$S\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$ and, as it is also a $\\pi$-system, this shows that\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is an algebra of sets on $X$. Finally, choose any\nsequence $A_n\\in\\mathcal{D}(A)$. Then, $\\bigcup_{m=1}^nA_m$ is a\nsequence in $\\mathcal{D}(A)$ increasing to $\\bigcup_nA_n$ which, as\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is Dynkin system, must be in $\\mathcal{D}(A)$. So,\n$\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra and must contain $\\sigma(A)$.\nConversely, as $\\sigma(A)$ is a Dynkin system (as it is a\n$\\sigma$-algebra) containing $A$, it must also contain $\\mathcal{D}(A)$.\n\n[9]{} David Williams, *Probability with martingales*, Cambridge\nMathematical Textbooks, Cambridge University Press, 1991.",
