  "statement": "Let $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ be two $\\sigma$-finite measures on the same\nmeasurable space $(\\Omega, \\mathscr{S})$, such that $\\nu\\ll \\mu$ (i.e.\n$\\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mu$.) Then there exists\na measurable function $f$, which is nonnegative and finite, such that\nfor each $A\\in \\mathscr{S}$, $$\\nu(A)=\\int_A fd\\mu.$$ This function is\nunique (any other function satisfying these conditions is equal to $f$\n$\\mu$-almost everywhere,) and it is called the *Radon-Nikodym\nderivative* of $\\nu$ with respect to $\\mu$, denoted by\n$f = \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}$.\n\n**Remark.** The theorem also holds if $\\nu$ is a signed measure. Even if\n$\\nu$ is not $\\sigma$-finite the theorem holds, with the exception that\n$f$ is not necessarely finite.\n\n**Some properties of the Radon-Nikodym derivative**\n\nLet $\\nu$, $\\mu$, and $\\lambda$ be $\\sigma$-finite measures in\n$(\\Omega,\\mathscr{S})$.\n\n1.
