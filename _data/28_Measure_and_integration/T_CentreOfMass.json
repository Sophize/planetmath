  "definition": "Let $\\nu$ be a Borel signed measure for some set\n$E \\subseteq {\\mathbb{R}}^n$. The [*centre of mass*]{} of $E$ (with\nrespect to $\\nu$) is a vector in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ defined by the\nfollowing vector-valued integral:\n$${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(E; \\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\nu(E)} \\int_{{\\mathbf{r}}\\in E} {\\mathbf{r}}\\, d\\nu\\,, \\quad \\nu(E) \\neq 0, \\pm \\infty\\,,$$\nprovided the integral exists. Intuitively, the integral is a weighted\naverage of all the points of $E$.\n\nOur abstract definition encompasses many situations. If $E$ is a\n$k$-dimensional manifold, then we may take $\\nu$ to be its absolute\n$k$-dimensional volume element ($d\\nu = dV$). This would give the set\n$E$ a unit mass density, and in this case the centre of mass of $E$ is\nalso called the [*centroid*]{} of $E$.\n\nMore generally, if we are given a measurable mass density\n$\\rho\\colon E \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$, then taking $d\\nu = \\rho dV$, the\ndefinition defines the centre of mass for $E$ with a mass density\n$\\rho$. We do not restrict the density $\\rho$ (or the measure $\\nu$) to\nbe non-negative; for this allows our definition to apply even to, for\nexample, electrical charge densities.\n\nIf $E$ is not a differentiable manifold, but is a rectifiable set, we\ncan replace $dV$ by the appropriate Hausdorff measure.\n\nThe measure $\\nu$ could also be discrete. For example, $E$ could be a\nfinite set of points $\\{ x_i \\} \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ with masses\n$m_i = \\nu(x_i)$. In this case, the integral\n${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(E; \\nu)$ reduces to a finite summation.\n\nIt is possible to economize the definition so that the set $E$ does not\nhave to be mentioned, although the result is somewhat unintuitive: the\n*centre of mass of a finite signed Borel measure* $\\nu$ on\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is defined by\n$${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\nu) = {\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}({\\mathbb{R}}^n; \\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\nu({\\mathbb{R}}^n)} \\int_{{\\mathbf{r}}\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n} {\\mathbf{r}}\\, d\\nu$$\n(provided this exists). If $\\nu_E$ is defined by\n$\\nu_E(S) = \\nu(S \\cap E)$ for all measurable $S$ and some fixed\nmeasurable $E$, then\n${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\nu_E) = {\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(E ; \\nu)$.\n\nThe term [*centre of gravity*]{} is sometimes used loosely as a synonym\nfor the centre of mass, but these are distinct concepts; the centre of\ngravity is supposed to be a single point on which the force of gravity\ncan be considered to act upon. If $E$ is three-dimensional and the force\nof gravity is uniform throughout $E$, then the centre of mass and the\ncentre of gravity coincide.\n\nAs shown by the above examples, the centre of mass and its related\nconcepts have applications in mechanics and other areas of physics.\n\nSymmetry principle {#symmetry-principle .unnumbered}\n==================\n\nIf $T \\colon {\\mathbb{R}}^n \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is an invertible linear\nmap, then by a straightforward change of variable in the integrand,\n$${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(TE; \\nu \\circ T^{-1}) = T({\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(E; \\nu) )\\,.$$\nIn particular, take $T$ to be an isometry, and $\\nu$ to be a\n$k$-dimensional volume measure for $E$. The corresponding\n$k$-dimensional volume measure for $TE$ must be the same as\n$\\nu \\circ T^{-1}$, because $T$ is an isometry. Then the above equation\nsays that the centroid transforms as expected under isometries.\n\nFor example, it is intuitively obvious that the centre of mass of a disk\n$D \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^2$ should be the centre of $D$. (Without loss of\ngenerality, assume that $D$ is centered at the origin.) Using the\nproperty just mentioned, this is easy to prove rigorously too: if $T$ is\nthe isometry that reflects across the y-axis, and $\\lambda$ is the\nLebesgue measure on ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$, then $$\\begin{aligned}\nT({\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(D; \\lambda)) &= {\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(TD; \\lambda \\circ T^{-1}) \\\\\n&= {\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(TD; \\lambda) &\\text{($\\lambda$ is invariant under isometries)} \\\\\n&= {\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(D; \\lambda)\\,, & \\text{($TD = D$ by symmetry of the disk)}\\end{aligned}$$\nwhich means the x component of ${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(D; \\lambda)$ must be\nzero. Similarly, by considering reflections across the x-axis, we\nconclude that the y component of ${\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(D; \\lambda)$ must\nbe zero.",
