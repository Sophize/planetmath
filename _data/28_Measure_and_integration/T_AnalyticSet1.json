  "definition": "(Note: this entry concerns analytic sets as used in measure theory. For\nthe definition in analytic spaces see ).\n\nFor a continuous map of topological spaces it is known that the\npreimages of open sets are open, preimages of sets are closed and\npreimages of Borel sets are themselves Borel measurable. The situation\nis more difficult for . That is if $f\\colon X\\rightarrow Y$ is\ncontinuous then it does not follow that $S\\subseteq X$ being\nopen/closed/measurable implies the same property for $f(S)$. In fact,\n$f(X)=\\operatorname{Image}(f)$ need not even be measurable. One of the\nfew things that can be said, however, is that $f(S)$ is compact whenever\n$S$ is compact. *Analytic sets* are defined in order to be stable under\ndirect images, and their theory relies on the stability of compact sets.\nThis is a fruitful concept because, as it turns out, all measurable sets\nare analytic and all analytic sets are universally measurable.\n\nA subset $S$ of a Polish space $X$ is said to be analytic (or, a *Suslin\nset*) if it is the image of a continuous map $f\\colon Z\\rightarrow X$\nfrom another Polish space $Z$ \u2014 see Cohn. It is then clear that $g(S)$\nwill again be analytic for any continuous map $g\\colon X\\rightarrow Y$\nbetween Polish spaces. Indeed, $g(S)$ will be the image of $g\\circ f$.\n\nHere, we instead give the following definition which applies to\narbitrary paved spaces and, in particular, to all measurable spaces.\nFurthermore, for Polish spaces, it can be shown to be equivalent to the\ndefinition just mentioned above.\n\nRecall that for a paved space $(X,\\mathcal{F})$,\n$\\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma\\delta}$ represents the collection of countable\nintersections of countable unions of elements of $\\mathcal{F}$, and that\na paving is compact if every subcollection satisfying the finite\nintersection property has nonempty intersection.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ be a paved space. Then a set $A\\subseteq X$ is\nsaid to be $\\mathcal{F}$-*analytic*, or *analytic with respect to*\n$\\mathcal{F}$, if there exists a compact paved space $(K,\\mathcal{K})$\nand an $S\\in(\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{K})_{\\sigma\\delta}$ such that\n$$A=\\pi(S).$$ Here, $\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{K}$ is the product paving\nand $\\pi\\colon X\\times K\\rightarrow X$ is the projection map\n$\\pi(x,y)=x$.\n\n![image](analyticpic)\n\nWriting this out explicitly, there are doubly indexed sequences of sets\n$A_{m,n}\\in\\mathcal{F}$ and $K_{m,n}\\in\\mathcal{K}$ such that\n$$S = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty\\bigcup_{m=1}^\\infty A_{m,n}\\times K_{m,n}.$$\nand,\n$$A=\\left\\{x\\in X\\colon (x,y)\\in S\\text{ for some }y\\in K\\right\\}.$$\nAlthough this allows for $\\mathcal{K}$ to be any compact paving it can\nbe shown that it makes no difference if it is just taken to be the\ncollection of compact subsets of, for example, the real numbers.\n\nFor a measurable space $(X,\\mathcal{F})$, a subset of $X$ is simply said\nto be analytic if it is $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic, and a subset of a\ntopological space is said to be analytic if it is analytic with respect\nto the .\n\n[9]{} K.
