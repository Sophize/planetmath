  "statement": "For a paved space $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ the $\\mathcal{F}$- sets can be\ndefined as the of sets in\n$(\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{K})_{\\sigma\\delta}$ onto $X$, for compact\npaved spaces $(K,\\mathcal{K})$. There are, however, many other\nequivalent definitions, some of which we list here.\n\nIn conditions \\[item:2\\] and \\[item:3\\] of the following theorem, Baire\nspace $\\mathcal{N}=\\mathbb{N}^\\mathbb{N}$ is the collection of sequences\nof natural numbers together with the product topology. In conditions\n\\[item:5\\] and \\[item:6\\], $Y$ can be any uncountable Polish space. For\nexample, we may take $Y=\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ be a paved space such that $\\mathcal{F}$ contains\nthe empty set, and $A$ be a subset of $X$. The following are equivalent.\n\n1.  $A$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic.\n\n2.  \\[item:2\\] There is a closed subset $S$ of $\\mathcal{N}$ and\n    $\\theta\\colon \\mathbb{N}^2\\to\\mathcal{F}$ such that\n    $$A=\\bigcup_{s\\in S}\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\theta\\left(n,s_n\\right).$$\n\n3.  \\[item:3\\] There is a closed subset $S$ of $\\mathcal{N}$ and\n    $\\theta\\colon \\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathcal{F}$ such that\n    $$A=\\bigcup_{s\\in S}\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\theta\\left(s_n\\right).$$\n\n4.  $A$ is the result of a Souslin scheme on $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n5.  \\[item:5\\] $A$ is the projection of a set in\n    $(\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{G})_{\\sigma\\delta}$ onto $X$, where\n    $\\mathcal{G}$ is the collection of closed subsets of $Y$.\n\n6.  \\[item:6\\] $A$ is the projection of a set in\n    $(\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{K})_{\\sigma\\delta}$ onto $X$, where\n    $\\mathcal{K}$ is the collection of compact subsets of $Y$.\n\nFor subsets of a measurable space, the following result gives a simple\ncondition to be analytic. Again, the space $Y$ can be any uncountable\nPolish space, and its Borel $\\sigma$-algebra is denoted by\n$\\mathcal{B}$. In particular, this result shows that a subset of the\nreal numbers is analytic if and only if it is the projection of a Borel\nset from $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet $(X,\\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. For a subset $A$ of $X$ the\nfollowing are equivalent.\n\n1.  $A$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-analytic.\n\n2.  $A$ is the projection of an\n    $\\mathcal{F}\\otimes\\mathcal{B}$-measurable subset of $X\\times Y$\n    onto $X$.\n\nWe finally state some equivalent definitions of analytic subsets of a\nPolish space. Again, $\\mathcal{N}$ denotes Baire space and $Y$ is any\nuncountable Polish space.\n\nFor a nonempty subset $A$ of a Polish space $X$ the following are\nequivalent.\n\n1.  \\[item:1\\] $A$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-.\n\n2.  \\[item:2\\] $A$ is the projection of a closed subset of\n    $X\\times\\mathcal{N}$ onto $X$.\n\n3.  \\[item:3\\] $A$ is the projection of a Borel subset of $X\\times Y$\n    onto $X$.\n\n4.  \\[item:4\\] $A$ is the of a continuous function $f\\colon Z\\to X$ for\n    some Polish space $Z$.\n\n5.  \\[item:5\\] $A$ is the image of a continuous function\n    $f\\colon \\mathcal{N}\\to X$.\n\n6.  \\[item:6\\] $A$ is the image of a Borel measurable function\n    $f\\colon Y\\to X$.",
