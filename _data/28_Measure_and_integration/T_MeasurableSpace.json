  "definition": "A *measurable space* is a set $E$ together with a collection\n$\\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $E$ which is a sigma algebra.\n\nThe elements of $\\mathcal{B}$ are called *measurable sets*.\n\nA measurable space is the correct object on which to define a measure;\n$\\mathcal{B}$ will be the collection of sets which actually have a\nmeasure. We normally want to ensure that $\\mathcal{B}$ contains all the\nsets we will ever want to use. We usually cannot take $\\mathcal{B}$ to\nbe the collection of all subsets of $E$ because the axiom of choice\noften allows one to construct sets that would lead to a contradiction if\nwe gave them a measure (even zero). For the real numbers, Vitali\u2019s\ntheorem states that $\\mathcal{B}$ cannot be the collection of all\nsubsets if we hope to have a measure that returns the length of an open\ninterval.",
