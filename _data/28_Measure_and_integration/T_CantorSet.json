  "definition": "The Cantor set $C$ is the canonical example of an uncountable set of\nmeasure zero. We construct $C$ as follows.\n\nBegin with the unit interval $C_0 = [0,1]$, and remove the open segment\n$R_1 {:=}(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3})$ from the middle. We define $C_1$ as\nthe two remaining pieces\n$$C_1 {:=}C_0 \\setminus R_1 = \\left[0,\\frac{1}{3}\\right] \\bigcup \\left[\\frac{2}{3},1\\right]$$\nNow repeat the process on each remaining segment, removing the open set\n$$R_2 {:=}\\left(\\frac{1}{9},\\frac{2}{9}\\right) \\bigcup \\left(\\frac{7}{9},\\frac{8}{9}\\right)$$\nto form the four-piece set\n$$C_2 {:=}C_1 \\setminus R_2 = \\left[0,\\frac{1}{9}\\right] \\bigcup \\left[\\frac{2}{9},\\frac{1}{3}\\right] \\bigcup \\left[\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{7}{9}\\right] \\bigcup \\left[\\frac{8}{9},1\\right]$$\nContinue the process, forming $C_3, C_4, \\ldots$ Note that $C_k$ has\n$2^k$ pieces. Also note that at each step, the endpoints of each closed\nsegment will stay in the set forever\u2014e.g., the point $\\frac{2}{3}$ isn\u2019t\ntouched as we remove sets.\n\nThe *Cantor set* is defined as\n$$C {:=}\\bigcap_{k=1}^{\\infty} C_k = C_0 \\setminus \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}R_n$$\n\n#### Cardinality of the Cantor set\n\nTo establish cardinality, we want a bijection between the Cantor set and\nsome set whose cardinality we know .\n\nStart at $C_1$, which has two pieces. Mark the left-hand segment \u201c0\u201d and\nthe right-hand segment \u201c1\u201d. Then continue to $C_2$, and consider only\nthe leftmost pair. Again, mark the segments \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, and do the same\nfor the rightmost pair.\n\nKeep doing this all the way down the $C_k$, starting at the left side\nand marking the segments 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 as you encounter them, until\nyou\u2019ve labeled the entire Cantor set.\n\nNow, pick a path through the tree starting at $C_0$ and going\nleft-left-right-left\u2026and so on. Mark a decimal point for $C_0$, and\nrecord the zeros and ones as you proceed. Each path has a unique number\nbased on your decision at each step. Every point in the Cantor set will\nhave a unique address dependent solely on the pattern of lefts and\nrights, 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s, required to reach it. The Cantor set therefore has\nthe same cardinality as the set of sequences of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s, which is\n$2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n#### The Cantor set and ternary expansions\n\nReturn, for a moment, to the earlier observation that numbers such as\n$\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{9}$, the endpoints of deleted intervals, are\nthemselves never deleted. In particluar, consider the first deleted\ninterval: the ternary expansions of its constituent numbers are\nprecisely those that begin $0.1$, and proceed thence with at least one\nnon-zero \u201cternary\u201d digit further along. Note also that the point\n$\\frac{1}{3}$, with ternary expansion $0.1$, may also be written\n$0.0\\dot{2}$ (or $0.0\\bar{2}$), which has no ternary digit $1$. Similar\ndescriptions apply to further deleted intervals. The result is that the\nCantor set is precisely those numbers in the set $[0,1]$ that have a\nternary expansion contains no digits $1$.\n\n#### Measure of the Cantor set\n\nLet $\\mu$ be Lebesgue measure. The measure of the sets $R_k$ that we\nremove during the construction of the Cantor set are $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu(R_1) &= \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\mu(R_2) &= \\left(\\frac{2}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{7}{9}\\right) = \\frac{2}{9}\\\\\n&\\ \\vdots\\\\\n\\mu(R_k) &= \\sum_{n=1}^{k}\\frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n}\\end{aligned}$$ Note that\nthe $R$\u2019s are disjoint, which will allow us to sum their measures\nwithout worry. In the limit $k \\to \\infty$, this gives us\n$$\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}R_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n} = 1.$$\nBut we have $\\mu(C_0) = 1$ as well, so this means\n$$\\mu(C) = \\mu\\left(C_0 \\setminus \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}R_n\\right) = \\mu(C_0) - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 1-1 = 0.$$\n\nThus we have seen that the measure of $C$ is zero (though see below for\nmore on this topic). How many points are there in $C$? Lots, as we shall\nsee.\n\nSo we have a set of measure zero (very tiny) with uncountably many\npoints (very big). This non-intuitive result is what makes Cantor sets\nso interesting.\n\n#### Cantor sets with positive measure\n\nClearly, Cantor sets can be constructed for all sorts of \u201cremovals\u201d\u2014we\ncan remove middle halves, or thirds, or any amount $\\frac{1}{r}, r>1$ we\nlike. All of these Cantor sets have measure zero, since at each step $n$\nwe end up with $$L_n = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right)^n$$ of what we\nstarted with, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} L_n = 0$ for any $r>1$. However,\nit is possible to construct Cantor sets with positive measure as well;\nthe key is to remove less and less as we proceed. These Cantor sets have\nthe same \u201cshape\u201d (topology) as the Cantor set we first constructed, and\nthe same cardinality, but a different \u201csize.\u201d\n\nAgain, start with the unit interval for $C_0$, and choose a number\n$0 < p < 1$. Let $$R_1 {:=}\\left(\\frac{2-p}{4},\\frac{2+p}{4}\\right)$$\nwhich has length (measure) $\\frac{p}{2}$. Again, define\n$C_1 {:=}C_0 \\setminus R_1$. Now define\n$$R_2 {:=}\\left(\\frac{2-p}{16},\\frac{2+p}{16}\\right) \\bigcup \\left(\\frac{14-p}{16},\\frac{14+p}{16}\\right)$$\nwhich has measure $\\frac{p}{4}$. Continue as before, such that each\n$R_k$ has measure $\\frac{p}{2^k}$; note again that all the $R_k$ are\ndisjoint. The resulting Cantor set has measure\n$$\\mu\\left(C_0 \\setminus \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}R_n \\right) = 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mu(R_n) = 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} p\\ 2^{-n} = 1-p > 0.$$\nThus we have a whole family of Cantor sets of positive measure to\naccompany their vanishing brethren.",
