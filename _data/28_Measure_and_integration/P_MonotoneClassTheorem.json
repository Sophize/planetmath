  "statement": "Let ${\\mathcal{F}}_0$ an algebra of subsets of $\\Omega$. Let\n${\\mathcal{M}}$ be the smallest monotone class such that\n${\\mathcal{F}}_0 \\subset {\\mathcal{M}}$ and $\\sigma({\\mathcal{F}}_0)$ be\nthe sigma algebra generated by ${\\mathcal{F}}_0$. Then\n${\\mathcal{M}}=\\sigma({\\mathcal{F}}_0)$.\n\nIt is enough to prove that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is an algebra, because an\nalgebra which is a monotone class is obviously a $\\sigma$-algebra.\n\nLet\n${\\mathcal{M}}_A=\\{B \\in {\\mathcal{M}}|A \\cap B, A \\cap B^\\complement \\mbox{ and } A^\\complement \\cap B\n\\in {\\mathcal{M}}\\}$. Then is clear that ${\\mathcal{M}}_A$ is a monotone\nclass and, in fact, ${\\mathcal{M}}_A={\\mathcal{M}}$, for if\n$A \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_0$, then ${\\mathcal{F}}_0 \\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_A$\nsince ${\\mathcal{F}}_0$ is a field, hence\n${\\mathcal{M}}\\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_A$ by minimality of ${\\mathcal{M}}$;\nconsequently ${\\mathcal{M}}={\\mathcal{M}}_A$ by definition of\n${\\mathcal{M}}_A$. But this shows that for any $B \\in {\\mathcal{M}}$ we\nhave $A \\cap B, A \\cap B^\\complement \\mbox{ and } A^\\complement\n\\cap B \\in {\\mathcal{M}}$ for any $A \\in {\\mathcal{F}}_0$, so that\n${\\mathcal{F}}_0 \\subset {\\mathcal{M}}_B$ and again by minimality\n${\\mathcal{M}}={\\mathcal{M}}_B$. But what we have just proved is that\n${\\mathcal{M}}$ is an algebra, for if\n$A,B \\in {\\mathcal{M}}={\\mathcal{M}}_A$ we have showed that $A\n\\cap B, A \\cap B^\\complement \\mbox{ and } A^\\complement \\cap B \\in {\\mathcal{M}}$,\nand, of course, $\\Omega \\in {\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nOne of the main applications of the Monotone Class Theorem is that of\nshowing that certain property is satisfied by all sets in an\n$\\sigma$-algebra, generally starting by the fact that the field\ngenerating the $\\sigma$-algebra satisfies such property and that the\nsets that satisfies it constitutes a monotone class.\n\nConsider an infinite sequence of independent random variables\n$\\{X_n, n \\in \\mathbb N\\}$. The definition of independence is\n$$P(X_1 \\in A_1, X_2 \\in A_2,...,X_n \\in A_n)=P(X_1 \\in A_1)P(X_2 \\in A_2)\\cdots P(X_n\n\\in A_n)$$ for any Borel sets $A_1, A_2,.., A_n$ and any finite $n$.\nUsing the Monotone Class Theorem one can show, for example, that any\nevent in $\\sigma(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$ is independent of any event in\n$\\sigma(X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)$. For, by independence\n$$P((X_1,X_2,...,X_n)\\in A, (X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)\\in B)=P((X_1,X_2,...,X_n)\\in A)P((X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)\\in B)$$\nwhen A and B are measurable rectangles in $\\mathcal B^n$ and $\\mathcal\nB^{\\infty}$ respectively. Now it is clear that the sets A which\nsatisfies the above relation form a monotone class. So\n$$P((X_1,X_2,...,X_n)\\in A, (X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)\\in B)=P((X_1,X_2,...,X_n)\\in A)P((X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)\\in B)$$\nfor every $A \\in \\sigma(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$ and any measurable rectangle\n$B \\in \\mathcal B^{\\infty}$. A second application of the theorem shows\nfinally that the above relation holds for any $A \\in\n\\sigma(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$ and $B \\in \\sigma(X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...)$",
