  "definition": "Let $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}},\\mathbb{P})$\nbe a filtered probability space, where the time index set\n$\\mathbb{T}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$ has minimal element $t_0$. The most\ncommon cases are discrete-time, with $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{Z}_+$, and\ncontinuous time where $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{R}_+$, in which case $t_0=0$.\n\nA process $X$ is said to be a *local martingale* if it is a\nright-continuous martingale. That is, if there is a sequence of stopping\ntimes $\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to infinity and such that the\nstopped processes $1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X^{\\tau_n}$ are martingales.\nEquivalently, $1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge t}$ is integrable and\n$$1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge s}=\\mathbb{E}[1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge t}\\mid\\mathcal{F}_s]$$\nfor all $s<t\\in\\mathbb{T}$. In the discrete-time case where\n$\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{Z}_+$ then it can be shown that a local martingale\n$X$ is a martingale if and only if $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t|]<\\infty$ for every\n$t\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$. More generally, in continuous-time where\n$\\mathbb{T}$ is an interval of the real numbers, then the stronger\nproperty that\n$$\\left\\{X_{\\tau}:\\tau\\le t\\textrm{ is a stopping time}\\right\\}$$ is\nuniformly integrable for every $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$ gives a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a local martingale to be a martingale.\n\nLocal martingales form a very important class of processes in the theory\nof stochastic calculus. This is because the local martingale property is\npreserved by the stochastic integral, but the martingale property is\nnot. Examples of local martingales which are not proper martingales are\ngiven by solutions to the stochastic differential equation\n$$dX = X^{\\alpha}\\,dW$$ where $X$ is a nonnegative process, $W$ is a\nBrownian motion and $\\alpha>1$ is a fixed real number.\n\nAn alternative definition of local martingales which is sometimes used\nrequires $X^{\\tau_n}$ to be a martingale for each $n$. This definition\nis slightly more restrictive, and is equivalent to the definition given\nabove together with the condition that $X_{t_0}$ must be integrable.",
