  "definition": "Consider the ordinary differential equation, for example, the population\ngrowth model $$\\frac{dX(t)}{dt}=a(t)X(t),\\, X(0)=X_0\\,,$$ where $a(t)$\nis the relative rate of growth at time $t$, and $X(t)$ is the\nsolution-trajectory of the system.\n\nBut we may want to take into account, in our model, the randomness or\nthe uncertainty of our knowledge of the data. In this case we may\nintroduce the data $a(t)$ as: $$a(t)=r(t)+ N(t)\\,,$$ where $N(t)$ is a\nnoise term, represented by a random variable with some postulated\nprobability distribution.\n\nIn general, stochastic differential equations can be posed in the case\nthat the infinitesimal increment $dX(t)$ is a Gaussian random variable.\n(Other types of random variables are also possible, but require\nextensions of the basic theory.) A *stochastic differential equation*\n(SDE) is an equation of the form:\n$$dX(t; \\omega) = \\mu(t; \\omega) \\, dt + \\sigma (t; \\omega) \\, dW(t; \\omega)$$\nwhere $\\omega$ lives in some probability space, and $W(t)$ is a Wiener\nprocess on that probability space. The real-valued functions $\\mu$ and\n$\\sigma$ are to satisfy certain measurability requirements, and are\nusually assumed to be known, with the process $X(t)$ being sought.\n\nThe argument $\\omega$ is usually suppressed in the notation:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq:sde}\ndX(t) = \\mu(t) \\, dt + \\sigma (t) \\, dW(t)\\,,\\end{aligned}$$ with the\nunderstanding that $X(t)$, $W(t)$, $\\mu(t)$ and $\\sigma(t)$ denote\nrandom variables for each time $t$.\n\nThe interpretation of the stochastic differential equation is that a\nprocess $X(t)$ satisfies it if and only if it satisfies this relation\namongst integrals: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq:ito}\nX(t_1) - X(t_0) = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\mu(t) \\, dt\n+ \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\sigma(t) \\, dW(t)\\end{aligned}$$ for all times $t_0$\nand $t_1$. The last integral is an It\u00f4 integral.\n\nIn many cases, the coefficients $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ depend on $X(t)$\nitself: $$dX(t) = \\mu(t, X(t)) \\, dt + \\sigma(t, X(t)) \\, dW(t)\\,.$$ In\nthis case, equation does not give an explicit solution for the\nstochastic differential equation. Nevertheless, there are theorems\nanalogous to those of ordinary differential equations, that guarantee\nexistence of solutions given certain bounds on the growth of the\ncoefficients $\\mu(t,x)$ and $\\sigma(t,x)$.\n\nIn simpler cases, stochastic differential equations that involve\nunknowns on the right-hand side may still be solved explicitly using\nchanges of variables (often called It\u00f4\u2019s formula in this context). For\nexample, $$X(t) = X_0 \\, e^{-\\kappa t} + \\theta \\, (1 - e^{-\\kappa t})\n+ \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{-\\kappa (t-s)} \\, dW(s)$$ (for any initial\ncondition $X_0$) provides a solution to:\n$$dX(t) = \\kappa\\, (\\theta - X(t)) \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dW(t)\\,.$$\n\n[9]{} Bernt \u00d8ksendal.
