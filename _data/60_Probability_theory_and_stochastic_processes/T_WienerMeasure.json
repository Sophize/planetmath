  "definition": "The *Wiener space* $W(\\mathbb{R})$ is just the set of all continuous\npaths $\\omega : [0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\\omega(0)=0$. It\nmay be made into a measurable space by equipping it with the\n$\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ generated by all projection maps\n$\\omega \\mapsto \\omega(t)$ (or the completion of this under Wiener\nmeasure, see below).\n\nThus, an $\\mathbb{R}$-valued continuous-time stochastic process $X_t$\nwith continuous sample paths can be thought of as a random variable\ntaking its values in $W(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nIn the case where $X_t = W_t$ is Brownian motion, the distribution\nmeasure $P$ induced on $W(\\mathbb{R})$ is called the *Wiener measure*.\nThat is, $P$ is the unique probability measure on $W(\\mathbb{R})$ such\nthat for any finite sequence of times $0<t_1<\\ldots<t_n$ and Borel sets\n$A_1,\\ldots,A_n \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ $$\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\{\\omega : \\omega(t_1)\\in A_1,\\ldots,\\omega(t_n) \\in A_n\\}) &=& \\int_{A_1}\\cdots\\int_{A_n} p(t_1,0,x_1)p(t_2-t_1,x_1,x_2)\\cdots \\\\\n&& \\cdots p(t_n-t_{n-1},x_{n-1},x_n) \\; dx_1 \\cdots \\; dx_n,\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $p(t,x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}}\\exp(-\\frac{(x-y)^2}{2t})$\ndefined for any $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $t>0$.\n\nThis of course corresponds to the defining property of Brownian motion.\nThe other properties carry over as well; for instance, the set of paths\nin $W(\\mathbb{R})$ which are nowhere differentiable is of $P$-measure\n$1$.\n\nThe Wiener space $W(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and corresponding Wiener measure are\ndefined similarly, in which case $P$ is the distribution of a\n$d$-dimensional Brownian motion.",
