  "definition": "Let $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+},\\mathbb{P})$\nbe a filtered probability space. Then a sequence of stochastic processes\n$(X^n_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ is said to converge to the process $(X_t)$\nin the *ucp topology* (uniform convergence on compacts in probability)\nif $$\\label{eq:1}\n\\sup_{s< t}|X^n_s-X_s|\\rightarrow 0$$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, for every\n$t> 0$. That is, if\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{s< t}|X^n_s-X_s|>\\epsilon)\\rightarrow 0$$ for all\n$\\epsilon,t>0$. The notation $X^n\\xrightarrow{\\rm ucp} X$ is sometimes\nused, and $X^n$ is said to converge ucp to $X$. This mode of convergence\noccurs frequently in the theory of continuous-time stochastic processes,\nand some examples are given below.\n\nNote that the expression on the left hand side of (\\[eq:1\\]) is a\nsupremum of an uncountable set of random variables and, therefore, need\nnot be a measurable quantity in general. If, however, the processes have\nleft or right-continuous sample paths, then the supremum can be\nrestricted to rational times $$\\sup_{s< t}|X^n_s-X_s|\n=\\sup_{\\substack{s<t,\\\\s\\in\\mathbb{Q}_+}}|X^n_s-X_s|$$ and is\nmeasurable. Typically, it is only required that the sample paths are\nleft or right-continuous almost surely, so the above equality holds on a\nset of probability one. More generally, if the processes are jointly\nmeasurable, then the expression on the left hand side of (\\[eq:1\\]) will\nbe a measurable random variable in the of the probability space (by the\nmeasurable projection theorem). This is enough to ensure that the\ndefinition above is meaningful, and gives a well defined topology on the\nspace of jointly measurable processes.\n\nThe ucp topology can be generated by a pseudometric. For example,\nsetting\n$$D^{\\rm ucp}(X)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{-n}\\mathbb{E}[\\min(1,\\sup_{s<n}|X_s|)]$$\nthen $(X,Y)\\mapsto D^{\\rm ucp}(X-Y)$ is a pseudometric on the space of\nmeasurable processes such that $X^n\\xrightarrow{\\rm ucp} X$ if and only\nif $D^{\\rm ucp}(X^n-X)\\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$.\nFurthermore, this becomes a metric under the identification of processes\nwith almost surely identical sample paths.\n\nIf $X^n\\xrightarrow{\\rm ucp} X$ then we may pass to a subsequence\nsatisfying $D(X^{n_{k}}-X)<2^{-k}$. The Borel-Cantelli lemma then\nimplies that $X^{n_k}\\rightarrow X$ uniformly on all compact intervals,\nwith probability one. So, any sequence converging in the ucp topology\nhas a subsequence converging uniformly on compacts, with probability\none. Consequently, given any property of the sample paths which is\npreserved under uniform convergence on compacts, then it is also\npreserved under ucp convergence with probability one. In particular, ucp\nlimits of cadlag processes are themselves cadlag.\n\nSome examples of ucp convergence are given below.\n\n1.  If $X^n,X$ are cadlag martingales such that\n    $\\mathbb{E}[|X^n_t-X_t|]\\rightarrow 0$ for every $t>0$ then, Doob\u2019s\n    inequality\n    $$\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{s\\le t}|X^n_s-X_s|>\\epsilon\\right)\\le\\epsilon^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[|X^n_t-X_t|]$$\n    shows that $X^n$ converges ucp to $X$.\n\n2.  Let $X$ be a semimartingale and $\\xi^n$ be predictable processes\n    converging pointwise to $\\xi$ such that $\\sup_n|\\xi^n|$ is\n    $X$-integrable. Then, the gives\n    $$\\int\\xi^n\\,dX\\xrightarrow{\\rm ucp}\\int\\xi\\,dX.$$\n\n3.  Suppose that the stochastic differential equation\n    $$dX=a(X)\\,dW+b(X)\\,dt$$ for continuous functions\n    $a,b\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ and Brownian motion $W$\n    has a unique solution with $X_0=0$. For any partition\n    $0=t_0\\le t_1\\le\\cdots\\uparrow\\infty$, the following discrete\n    approximation can be constructed\n    $$\\tilde X_0=0,\\ \\tilde X_{t_{k+1}}=\\tilde X_{t_k}+a(\\tilde X_{t_k})(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})+b(\\tilde X_{t_k})(t_{k+1}-t_{k}).$$\n    Setting $\\tilde X_t=\\tilde X_{t_k}$ for $t\\in(t_k,t_{k+1})$ then\n    these discrete approximations converge to $X$ in the ucp topology as\n    the partition mesh goes to zero.\n\n[9]{} Philip E.
