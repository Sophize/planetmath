  "statement": "Let $X$ be a semimartingale. Then a predictable process $\\xi$ is\n$X$-integrable if the stochastic integral $\\int\\xi\\,dX$ is defined,\nwhich is equivalent to the set\n$$\\left\\{\\int_0^t\\alpha\\,dX:|\\alpha|\\le |\\xi|\\textrm{ is predictable}\\right\\}$$\nbeing bounded in probability, for each $t>0$. We list some properties of\n$X$-integrable processes.\n\n1.  Every locally bounded predictable process is $X$-integrable.\n\n2.  The $X$-integrable processes are closed under linear combinations.\n    That is, if $\\alpha,\\beta$ are $X$-integrable and\n    $\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\lambda\\alpha+\\mu\\beta$ is\n    $X$-integrable.\n\n3.  If $|\\alpha|\\le|\\beta|$ are predictable processes and $\\beta$ is\n    $X$-integrable, then so is $\\alpha$.\n\n4.  A process is $X$-integrable if it is locally $X$-integrable. That\n    is, if there are stopping times $\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to\n    infinity and such that $1_{\\{t\\le\\tau_n\\}}\\xi_t$ is $X$-integrable,\n    then $\\xi$ is $X$-integrable.",
