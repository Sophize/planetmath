  "definition": "Let $W(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ be Wiener space. The *Cameron-Martin space*\n$H(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ is the subspace of $W(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ consisting of all\npaths $\\omega$ such that $\\omega$ is absolutely continuous and\n$\\int_0^\\infty |\\omega'(s)|^2\\,ds < \\infty$. (Note that if $\\omega$ is\nabsolutely continuous, then it is almost everywhere differentiable, so\nthe integral makes sense.)\n\nThis can be thought of as the set of paths with \u201cfinite energy.\u201d\n\nNote that $H(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ has Wiener measure $0$, since sample paths\nof Brownian motion are nowhere differentiable, whereas a path from\n$H(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ is almost everywhere differentiable.",
