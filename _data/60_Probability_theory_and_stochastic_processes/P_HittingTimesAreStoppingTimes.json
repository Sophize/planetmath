If $X$ is an adapted stochastic process taking\nvalues in a measurable space $(E,\\mathcal{A})$ then the *hitting time*\nof a set $S\\in\\mathcal{A}$ is defined as $$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\tau\\colon\\Omega\\rightarrow\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\pm\\infty\\},\\\\\n&\\tau(\\omega)=\\inf\\left\\{t\\in\\mathbb{T}:X_t(\\omega)\\in S\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}$$\nWe suppose that $\\mathbb{T}$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, so the\nhitting time $\\tau$ will indeed lie in $\\mathbb{T}$ whenever it is\nfinite. The main cases are discrete-time when $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{Z}_+$\nand continuous-time where $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{R}_+$. An important\nproperty of hitting times is that they are stopping times, as stated\nbelow for the different cases.\n\nDiscrete-time processes {#discrete-time-processes .unnumbered}\n-----------------------\n\nFor discrete-time processes, hitting times are easily shown to be\nstopping times.\n\nIf the index set $\\mathbb{T}$ is discrete, then the hitting time $\\tau$\nis a stopping time.\n\nFor any $s\\le t\\in\\mathbb{T}$ then $X_s$ will be\n$\\mathcal{F}_t/\\mathcal{A}$-measurable, as it is adapted. So, by the\nfact that the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is closed under taking\ncountable unions,\n$$\\left\\{\\tau\\le t\\right\\}=\\bigcup_{\\substack{s\\in\\mathbb{T},\\\\ s\\le t}}X_s^{-1}(S)\\in\\mathcal{F}_t$$\nas required.\n\nContinuous processes {#continuous-processes .unnumbered}\n--------------------\n\nFor continuous-time processes it is not necessarily true that a hitting\ntime is even measurable, unless further conditions are imposed.\nProcesses with continuous sample paths can be dealt with easily.\n\nSuppose that $X$ is a continuous and adapted process taking values in a\nmetric space $E$. Then, the hitting time $\\tau$ of any closed subset\n$S\\subseteq E$ is a stopping time.\n\nWe may suppose that $S$ is nonempty, and define the continuous function\n$d_S(x)\\equiv\\inf\\{d(x,y)\\colon y\\in S\\}$ on $E$. Then, $\\tau$ is the\nfirst time at which $Y_t\\equiv d_S(X_t)$ hits $0$. Letting $U$ be any\ncountable and dense subset of $\\mathbb{T}\\cap[0,t]$ then the continuity\nof the sample paths of $Y$ gives,\n$$\\left\\{\\tau\\le t\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\inf_{u\\in U}Y_u=0\\right\\}.$$ As the\ninfimum of a countable set of measurable functions is measurable, this\nshows that $\\{\\tau\\le t\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\nRight-continuous processes {#right-continuous-processes .unnumbered}\n--------------------------\n\nRight-continuous processes are more difficult to handle than either the\ndiscrete-time and continuous sample path situations. The first time at\nwhich a right-continuous process hits a given value need not be\nmeasurable. However, it can be shown to be universally measurable, and\nthe following result holds.\n\nSuppose that $X$ is a right-continuous and adapted process taking values\nin a metric space $E$, and that the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ is\nuniversally complete. Then, the hitting time $\\tau$ of any closed subset\n$S\\subseteq E$ is a stopping time.\n\nIn particular, the hitting time of any closed set $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$\nfor an adapted right-continuous and real-valued process is a stopping\ntime.\n\nThe proof of this result is rather more involved than the case for\ncontinuous processes, and the condition that $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is\nuniversally complete is necessary.\n\nProgressively measurable processes {#progressively-measurable-processes .unnumbered}\n----------------------------------\n\nThe d\u00e9but $D(A)$ of a set $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{T}\\times\\Omega$ is defined\nto be the hitting time of $\\{1\\}$ for the process $1_A$,\n$$D(A)(\\omega)=\\inf\\left\\{ t\\in\\mathbb{T}:(t,\\omega)\\in A\\right\\}.$$ An\nimportant result for continuous-time stochastic processes is the d\u00e9but\ntheorem.\n\nSuppose that the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ is right-continuous and\nuniversally complete. Then, the d\u00e9but $D(A)$ of a progressively\nmeasurable $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{T}\\times\\Omega$ is a stopping time.\n\nProofs of this typically rely upon properties of analytic sets, and are\ntherefore much more complicated than the result above for\nright-continuous processes.\n\nA process $X$ taking values in a measurable space $(E,\\mathcal{A})$ is\nsaid to be progressive if the set $X^{-1}(S)$ is progressively\nmeasurable for every $S\\in\\mathcal{A}$. In particular, the hitting time\nof $S$ is equal to the d\u00e9but of $X^{-1}(S)$ and the d\u00e9but theorem has\nthe following immediate corollary.\n\nSuppose that the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ is right-continuous and\nuniversally complete, and that $X$ is a progressive process taking\nvalues in a measurable space $(E,\\mathcal{A})$. Then, the hitting time\n$\\tau$ of any set $S\\in\\mathcal{A}$ is a stopping time.",
