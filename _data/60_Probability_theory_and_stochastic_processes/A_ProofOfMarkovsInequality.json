  "argumentText": "Define $$Y = \\begin{cases}\n  d & X \\ge d \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\\n\\end{cases}.$$ Then $0 \\le Y \\le X$. Additionally, it follows\nimmediately from the definition that $Y$ is a random variable (i.e.,\nthat it is measurable). Computing the expected value of $Y$, we have\nthat\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] \\ge \\mathbb{E}[Y] = d\\cdot\\mathbb{P}_{}\\left\\{X \\ge d\\right\\},$$\nand the inequality follows.",
