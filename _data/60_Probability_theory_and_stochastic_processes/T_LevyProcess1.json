  "definition": "Let $(\\Omega,\\Psi,P,({\\cal F})_{0\\le t<\\infty})$ be a filtered\nprobability space. A process on that space is an stochastic process\n$L\\colon[0,\\infty)\\times\\Omega\\rightarrow \\Re^n$ that has the following\nproperties:\n\n1.  $L$ has increments independent of the past: for any $t\\ge 0$ and for\n    all $s\\ge 0$, $L_{t+s}-L_t$ in independent of ${\\cal F}_t$\n\n2.  $L$ has stationary increments: if $t\\ge s\\ge 0$ then $L_t-L_s$ and\n    $L_{t-s}$ have the same distribution. This particulary implies that\n    $L_{t+s}-L_{t}$ and $L_{s}$ have the same distribution.\n\n3.  $L$ is continous in probability: for any $t,s\\in [0,\\infty)$,\n    $\\lim_{t\\rightarrow s}=X_s$, the limit taken in probability.\n\n0.5pc\n\nSome important properties of any processes $L$ are:\n\n1.  There exist a modification of $L$ that has paths a.s. (paths means\n    that the paths are continuous from the right and that the left\n    limits exist for any $t\\ge 0$).\n\n2.  $L_t$ is an infinite divisible random variable for all\n    $t\\in [0,\\infty)$\n\n3.  [*-decomposition*]{}: $L$ can be written as the sum of a diffusion,\n    a continuous Martingale and a pure jump process;\n    i.e:$$L_t=\\alpha t+\\sigma B_t+\\int_{\\vert x\\vert<1}x\\,d\\tilde N_t(\\cdot,dx)+\\int_{\\vert x\\vert\\ge 1}x\\,dN_t(\\cdot,dx)\\quad \\hbox{for all $t\\ge 0$}$$where\n    $\\alpha \\in \\Re$, $B_t$ is a standard brownian motion. $N$ is\n    defined to be the Poisson random measure of the process (the process\n    that counts the jumps): for any Borel $A$ in $\\Re^n$ such that\n    $0 \\notin cl(A)$ then\n    $N_t(\\cdot,A)\\colon= \\sum_{0<s\\le t}1_{A}(\\Delta L_s)$, where\n    $\\Delta L_s\\colon= L_s-L_{s-}$; and\n    $\\tilde N_t(\\cdot,A)=N_t(\\cdot,A)-tE[N_1(\\cdot,A)]$ is the\n    compensated jump process, which is a martingale.\n\n4.  [*-Khintchine formula*]{}: from the previous property it can be\n    shown that for any $t\\ge 0$ one has\n    that$$E[e^{iuL_t}]=e^{-t\\psi(u)}$$where$$\\psi(u)=-i\\alpha u+{\\sigma^2 \\over 2}u^2+\\int_{\\vert x\\vert \\ge 1}(1-e^{iux})\\,d\\nu(x)+\\int_{\\vert x\\vert<1}(1-e^{iux}+iux)\\,d\\nu(x)$$with\n    $\\alpha\\in \\Re$, $\\sigma \\in [0,\\infty)$ and $\\nu$ is a positive,\n    borel, $\\sigma$-finite measure called [*measure*]{}. (Actually\n    $\\nu(\\cdot)=E[N_1(\\cdot,A)]$). The second formula is usually called\n    the exponent or symbol of the process.\n\n5.  $L$ is a semimartingale (in the classical sense of being a sum of a\n    finite variation process and a local martingale), so it is a\n    [*good*]{} integrator, in the stochastic sense.\n\nSome important examples of processes include: the Poisson Process, the\nCompound Poisson process, Brownian Motion, Stable Processes,\nSubordinators, etc.\n\n[**Bibliography**]{}\n\n-   Protter, Phillip (1992).
