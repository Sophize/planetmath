  "definition": "The quadratic variation of a process is an extension of the notion of\nthe total variation of a function, but rather than summing the absolute\nvalues of the changes of a function sampled at a sequence of times, the\nsquares are summed. This has important applications in stochastic\ncalculus, appearing in the integration by parts and change of variables\nformulas for stochastic integration. The quadratic variation also has\napplications to the study of martingales, occuring in the Ito isometry\nand Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequalities.\n\nAn important example is for a Brownian motion $W$. In this case, the\nquadratic variation is $[W]_t=t$ and, by L\u00e9vy\u2019s theorem, this fact\ncharacterizes Brownian motion among all local martingales. Quadratic\nvariations are well defined for all cadlag martingales and, more\ngenerally, all semimartingales.\n\nIn standard, non-stochastic calculus, quadratic variation does not play\na large role. This is because it is equal to zero for all continuously\ndifferentiable processes and, in fact, for all continuous finite\nvariation processes. Furthermore, it can be shown if any continuous\ndeterministic process has a well defined quadratic variation along all ,\nthen it is zero.\n\nIn the following definitions, we assume the existence of a probability\nspace $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$.\n\ndiscrete time processes\n=======================\n\nLet $(X_t)$ be a stochastic process, with time ranging over the\nnonnegative integers $t=0,1,2,\\ldots$. Then, the quadratic variation\n$[X]$ is the process $$[X]_t=\\sum_{s=1}^t(X_{s}-X_{s-1})^2.$$ Similarly,\nfor processes $X,Y$, the *quadratic covariation* $[X,Y]$ is defined by\n$$[X,Y]_t=\\sum_{s=1}^t(X_{s}-X_{s-1})(Y_{s}-Y_{s-1}).$$ Note that\n$[X,Y]$ is bilinear and symmetric in interchanging $X$ and $Y$. The\nquadratic variation is alternatively given by $[X]=[X,X]$, and the\ncovariation can be written in terms of the quadratic variation by the\npolarization identity, $$[X,Y]=([X+Y]-[X-Y])/4.$$\n\nquadratic variation on an interval\n==================================\n\nNow suppose that $(X_t)$ is a stochastic process with time $t$ running\nover the interval $[0,T]$, for some $T>0$. If $P$ is a partition of the\ninterval, $$P=\\left\\{0=\\tau_0\\le\\tau_1\\le\\cdots\\le\\tau_m=T\\right\\}$$\nthen we can define the quadratic variation and covariation along the\npartition $P$ by $$\\begin{aligned}\n&[X]^P\\equiv\\sum_{k=1}^m(X_{\\tau_k}-X_{\\tau_{k-1}})^2,\\\\\n&[X,Y]^P\\equiv\\sum_{k=1}^m(X_{\\tau_k}-X_{\\tau_{k-1}})(Y_{\\tau_k}-Y_{\\tau_{k-1}}).\\end{aligned}$$\nThe *mesh* of the partition is $|P|=\\max_k(\\tau_k-\\tau_{k-1})$. Given a\nsequence of partitions $P_n$ with mesh going to zero as\n$n\\rightarrow \\infty$, the quadratic variation and covariation are\ndefined by\n$$[X]_T\\equiv\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}[X]^{P_n},\\ [X,Y]_T\\equiv\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}[X,Y]^{P_n}.$$\nIt is only required that these limits exist under convergence in\nprobability, which is much weaker than requiring convergence for all or\nalmost all $\\omega\\in\\Omega$. The limits are not guaranteed to exist. If\nthey do, then the quadratic variation and covariation are said to exist\nalong the sequence of partitions $P_n$.\n\nMore generally, *random partitions* can be used where the times $\\tau_k$\nare random variables, usually stopping times. In this case, the\nprocesses $X,Y$ are required to satisfy additional properties in order\nfor their values at a random time to make sense, normally that they are\nright-continuous or cadlag. The mesh of each partition $P_n$ is then a\nrandom variable, and is only required to tend to zero in probability as\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n\nIf the quadratic variation (respectively, covariation) exists along all\nsuch sequences of non-stochastic, or *deterministic*, partitions then it\nis easily shown to be independent of the sequence of partitions used. In\nthis case, we simply say that the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ (resp.\ncovariation $[X,Y]_T$) exists without referring to the partitions used.\n\nquadratic variation as a process\n================================\n\nSuppose that $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$ are stochastic processes with time\nindex running over the nonnegative real numbers, $t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$. In\nthis case, the quadratic variation and covariation can be defined as as\nabove over the interval $[0,t]$, for each $t>0$.\n\nHowever, in continuous-time, defining it in this way does not determine\nthe sample paths of the processes $[X]_t$, $[X,Y]_t$. This is because\nthese random variables are only defined $\\mathbb{P}$-almost everywhere\nat each $t$, which does not say anything about their joint properties at\nuncountably many times. It is possible to remedy this by requiring that\nthe quadratic variation and covariation be right-continuous. That is, we\ntake a right-continuous version of the processes.\n\nAlternatively, the limits can be taken simultaneously at all times. If\n$P$ is a partition of $\\mathbb{R}_+$,\n$$P=\\left\\{0=\\tau_0\\le\\tau_1\\le\\tau_2\\le\\cdots\\uparrow\\infty\\right\\}$$\nthen the quadratic variation and covariation along the partition $P$ are\nthe processes $$\\begin{aligned}\n&[X]^P_t\\equiv\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(X_{\\tau_k\\wedge t}-X_{\\tau_{k-1}\\wedge t}\\right)^2,\\\\\n&[X,Y]^P_t\\equiv\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(X_{\\tau_k\\wedge t}-X_{\\tau_{k-1}\\wedge t}\\right)\\left(Y_{\\tau_k\\wedge t}-Y_{\\tau_{k-1}\\wedge t}\\right).\\end{aligned}$$\nSince $\\tau_k\\rightarrow\\infty$, all but finitely many terms in these\nsums will be zero. As above, the partition $P$ may be random, in which\ncase $\\tau_k$ are random variables.\n\nNow suppose that $P_n$ is a sequence of such partitions whose mesh over\nthe bounded intervals $[0,t]$,\n$|P_n^t|\\equiv\\max_k(\\tau_k\\wedge t-\\tau_{k-1}\\wedge t)$ tends to zero\nin probability as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$. Then the quadratic variation and\ncovariation along $P_n$ is defined by the limits\n$$[X]\\equiv \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}[X]^{P_n},\\ [X,Y]\\equiv\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}[X,Y]^{P_n}.$$\nThe limit here is usually required to exist under ucp convergence. As a\nconsequence, quadratic variations of cadlag adapted processes are\nthemselves cadlag and adapted, and quadratic variations of continuous\nprocesses are continuous.\n\nIf the quadratic variation or covariation exists along all such\nsequences of deterministic partitions then, as above, they are simply\nsaid to exist without making reference to the partitions used.\n\nAs squares of real numbers are positive, it follows that the quadratic\nvariation is an increasing process and, by the polarization identity, if\n$[X],[Y],[X,Y]$ all exist then the quadratic covariation is a difference\nof increasing functions, and so is a finite variation process.\n\nThe quadratic variation and covariation are sometimes written as\n$$[X]_t=\\int_0^t\\,(dX)^2,\\ [X,Y]_t=\\int_0^t\\,dX\\,dY,$$ and in\ndifferential notation, $$d[X]_t=(dX_t)^2,\\ d[X,Y]_t=dX_t\\,dY_t.$$\n\nIf we write $\\Delta X_t\\equiv X_t-X_{t-}$ for the jump of a cadlag\nprocess at time $t$ then, as a consequence of ucp convergence,\n$$\\Delta [X]_t=(\\Delta X_t)^2,\\ \\Delta [X,Y]_t=\\Delta X_t \\Delta Y_t.$$\nThese identities hold simultaneously for all times $t>0$, with\nprobability one.",
