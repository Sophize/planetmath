  "definition": "For an ordered set $T$, a filtration of $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in T}$ is a\ncollection of $\\sigma$-algebras on an underlying set $\\Omega$,\nsatisfying $\\mathcal{F}_s\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $s<t$ in $T$.\nHere, $t$ is understood as the time variable, taking values in the index\nset $T$, and $\\mathcal{F}_t$ represents the collection of all events\nobservable up until time $t$. The index set is usually a subset of the\nreal numbers, with common examples being $T=\\mathbb{Z}_+$ for\ndiscrete-time and $T=\\mathbb{R}_+$ for continuous-time scenarios. The\ncollection $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in T}$ is a filtration on a measurable\nspace $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$ if $\\mathcal{F}_t\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}$ for\nevery $t$. If, furthermore, there is a probability measure defined on\nthe underlying measurable space then this gives a filtered probability\nspace. The alternative notation $(\\mathcal{F}_t,t\\in T)$ is often used\nfor the filtration or, when the index set $T$ is clear from the context,\nsimply $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ or ${\\bf F}$.\n\nFiltrations are widely used for studying stochastic processes, where a\nprocess $X_t$ with time ranging over the set $T$ is said to be adapted\nto the filtration if $X_t$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable random\nvariable for each time $t$.\n\nConversely, any stochastic process $(X_t)_{t\\in T}$ generates a\nfiltration. Let $\\mathcal{F}_t$ be the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra with\nrespect to which $X_s$ is measurable for all $s\\le t$,\n$$\\mathcal{F}_t=\\sigma\\left(X_s:s\\le t\\right).$$ This defines the\nsmallest filtration to which $X$ is adapted, known as the *natural\nfiltration* of $X$.\n\nGiven a filtration, there are various limiting $\\sigma$-algebras which\ncan be defined. The values at plus and minus infinity are\n$$\\mathcal{F}_\\infty = \\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_t\\mathcal{F}_t\\right),\\\n\\mathcal{F}_{-\\infty} = \\bigcap_t\\mathcal{F}_t,$$ which satisfy\n$\\mathcal{F}_{-\\infty}\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_t\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_\\infty$.\nIn continuous-time, when the index set is an interval of the real\nnumbers, the left and right limits can be defined at any time. They are,\n$$\\mathcal{F}_{t+}=\\bigcap_{s>t}\\mathcal{F}_s,\\ \\mathcal{F}_{t-}=\\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{s<t}\\mathcal{F}_s\\right),$$\nexcept if $t$ is the maximum of $T$ it is often convenient to set\n$\\mathcal{F}_{t+}=\\mathcal{F}_t$ or, if $t$ is the minimum,\n$\\mathcal{F}_{t-}=\\mathcal{F}_t$. It is easily verified that\n$\\mathcal{F}_s\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_{s+}\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_{t-}\\subseteq\\mathcal{F}_t$\nfor all times $s<t$. Furthermore, $(\\mathcal{F}_{t+})$ and\n$(\\mathcal{F}_{t-})$ are themselves filtrations.\n\nA filtration is said to be right-continuous if\n$\\mathcal{F}_t=\\mathcal{F}_{t+}$ for every $t$ so, in particular,\n$(\\mathcal{F}_{t+})$ is always the smallest right-continuous filtration\nlarger than $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$.",
