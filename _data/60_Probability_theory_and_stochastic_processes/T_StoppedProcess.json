  "definition": "A stochastic process $(X_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ defined on a measurable\nspace $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$ can be stopped at a random time\n$\\tau\\colon\\Omega\\rightarrow\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$. The resulting\nstopped process is denoted by $X^{\\tau}$,\n$$X^\\tau_t\\equiv X_{\\min(t,\\tau)}.$$ The random time $\\tau$ used is\ntypically a stopping time.\n\nIf the process $X_t$ has for every $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$, then it can\nalternatively be stopped just before the time $\\tau$, resulting in the\npre-stopped process $$X^{\\tau-}\\equiv\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nX_t,&\\textrm{if }t<\\tau,\\\\\nX_{\\tau-},&\\textrm{if }t\\ge\\tau.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$\n\nStopping is often used to enforce boundedness or integrability\nconstraints on a process. For example, if $B$ is a Brownian motion and\n$\\tau$ is the first time at which $|B_{\\tau}|$ hits some given positive\nvalue, then the stopped process $B^{\\tau}$ will be a continuous and\nbounded martingale. It can be shown that many properties of stochastic\nprocesses, such as the martingale property, are stable under stopping at\nany stopping time $\\tau$. On the other hand, a pre-stopped martingale\nneed not be a martingale.\n\nFor continuous processes, stopping and pre-stopping are equivalent\nprocedures. If $\\tau$ is the first time at which $|X_\\tau|\\ge K$, for\nany given real number $K$, then the pre-stopped process $X^{\\tau-}$ will\nbe uniformly bounded. However, for some noncontinuous processes it is\nnot possible to find a stopping time $\\tau>0$ making $X^\\tau$ into a\nuniformly bounded process. For example, this is the case for any with\nunbounded jump distribution.\n\nStopping is used to generalize properties of stochastic processes to\nobtain the related localized property.
