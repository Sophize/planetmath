  "definition": "Let $( \\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ be a on a set $\\Omega$. A random\nvariable $\\tau$ taking values in $\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is a\n*stopping time* for the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ if the event\n$\\lbrace \\tau\\le t \\rbrace \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for every\n$t\\in\\mathbb{T}$.\\\n\\\n**Remarks**\n\n-   The set $\\mathbb{T}$ is the index set for the time variable $t$, and\n    the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is the collection of all events\n    which are observable up to and including time $t$. Then, the\n    condition that $\\tau$ is a stopping time means that the outcome of\n    the event $\\{\\tau\\le t\\}$ is known at time $t$.\n\n-   In discrete time situations, where $\\mathbb{T}=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$,\n    the condition that $\\{\\tau\\le t\\}\\in\\mathcal{F}_t$ is equivalent to\n    requiring that $\\{\\tau=t\\}\\in\\mathcal{F}_t$. This is not true for\n    continuous time cases where $\\mathbb{T}$ is an interval of the real\n    numbers and hence uncountable, due to the fact that\n    $\\sigma$-algebras are not in general closed under taking uncountable\n    unions of events.\n\n-   A random time $\\tau$ is a stopping time for a stochastic process\n    $(X_t)$ if it is a stopping time for the natural filtration of $X$.\n    That is, $\\{\\tau\\le t\\}\\in\\sigma(X_s:s\\le t)$.\n\n-   The first time that an adapted process $X_t$ hits a given value or\n    set of values is a stopping time. The inclusion of $\\infty$ into the\n    range of $\\tau$ is to cover the case where $X_t$ never hits the\n    given values.\n\n-   Stopping time is often used in gambling, when a gambler stops the\n    betting process when he reaches a certain goal. The time it takes to\n    reach this goal is generally not a deterministic one. Rather, it is\n    a random variable depending on the current result of the bet, as\n    well as the combined information from all previous bets.\n\n**Examples.** A gambler has \\$1,000 and plays the slot machine at \\$1\nper play.\n\n1.  The gambler stops playing when his capital is depleted. The number\n    $\\tau=n_1$ of plays that it takes the gambler to stop is a stopping\n    time.\n\n2.  The gambler stops playing when his capital reaches \\$2,000. The\n    number $\\tau=n_2$ of plays that it takes the gambler to stop is a\n    stopping time.\n\n3.  The gambler stops playing when his capital either reaches \\$2,000,\n    or is depleted, which ever comes first. The number\n    $\\tau=\\operatorname{min}(n_1,n_2)$ of plays that it takes the\n    gambler to stop is a stopping time.",
