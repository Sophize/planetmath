  "definition": "Many properties of stochastic processes, such as the martingale\nproperty, can be generalized to a corresponding local property. The\nlocal properties can be more useful than the original property because\nthey are often preserved under certain transformations of processes,\nsuch as random time changes and stochastic integration.\n\nLet $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}},\\mathbb{P})$\nbe a filtered probability space and $\\pi$ be a property of stochastic\nprocesses with time index set $\\mathbb{T}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$. The\nproperty $\\pi$ is said to hold *locally* for a process $X$ if there\nexists a sequence of stopping times $(\\tau_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+}$ taking\nvalues in $\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ and almost surely increasing to\ninfinity, such that the stopped processes $X^{\\tau_n}$ have property\n$\\pi$ for each $n$.\n\nOften, the index set $\\mathbb{T}$ has a minimal element $t_0$, in which\ncase it is convenient to extend the concept of localization slightly so\nthat $\\pi$ holds locally if there is a sequence of stopping times\n$\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to infinity and such that\n$1_{\\{\\tau_n> t_0\\}}X^{\\tau_n}$ have property $\\pi$.\n\nThe property of locally satisfying $\\pi$ is often denoted as\n$\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}}$. Similarly, if $\\pi$ is a class of processes then\nthe processes which are locally in $\\pi$ is denoted by\n$\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}}$. Letting $\\tau_n$ be the stopping times taking the\nconstant value $\\infty$ shows that every process in $\\pi$ is also\nlocally in $\\pi$, so $\\pi\\subseteq\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}}$.\n\nIn most cases where localization is used, such as with the class of\nright-continuous martingales, for any process $X$ in $\\pi$ and stopping\ntime $\\tau$ then $1_{\\{\\tau>t_0\\}}X^\\tau$ is also in $\\pi$. If this is\nthe case then it is easily shown that a process is locally in\n$\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}}$ if and only if it is locally in $\\pi$. So,\n$(\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}})_{\\textrm{loc}}=\\pi_{\\textrm{loc}}$.\n\nExamples of commonly used local properties are as follows.\n\n1.  A process $X$ is said to be a *local martingale* if it is locally a\n    right-continuous martingale. That is, if there is a sequence of\n    stopping times $\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to infinity and\n    such that $1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge t}$ is integrable and,\n    $$1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge s}=\\mathbb{E}[1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X_{\\tau_n\\wedge t}\\mid\\mathcal{F}_s]$$\n    for all $s<t\\in\\mathbb{T}$. In the discrete-time case where\n    $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{Z}_+$ then it can be shown that a local\n    martingale $X$ is a martingale if and only if\n    $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t|]<\\infty$ for every $t\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$. More\n    generally, in continuous-time where $\\mathbb{T}$ is an interval of\n    the real numbers, then the stronger property that\n    $$\\left\\{X_{\\tau}:\\tau\\le t\\textrm{ is a stopping time}\\right\\}$$ is\n    uniformly integrable for every $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$ gives a necessary\n    and sufficient condition for a local martingale to be a martingale.\n\n    Local martingales form a very important class of processes in the\n    theory of stochastic calculus. This is because the local martingale\n    property is preserved by the stochastic integral, but the martingale\n    property is not. Examples of local martingales which are not proper\n    martingales are given by solutions to the stochastic differential\n    equation $$dX = X^{\\alpha}\\,dW$$ where $X$ is a nonnegative process,\n    $W$ is a Brownian motion and $\\alpha>1$ is a fixed real number.\n\n    An alternative definition of local martingales which is sometimes\n    used requires $X^{\\tau_n}$ to be a martingale for each $n$. This\n    definition is slightly more restrictive, and is equivalent to the\n    definition given above together with the condition that $X_{t_0}$\n    must be integrable.\n\n2.  A *local submartingale* (resp. *local supermartingale*) is a\n    right-continuous process which is locally a submartingale (resp.\n    supermartingale). A local submartingale can be shown to be a\n    submartingale if and only if $X_{t_0}$ is integrable and the set\n    $\\{X_\\tau\\vee 0:\\tau\\le t\\textrm{ is a stopping time}\\}$ is locally\n    integrable for every $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$. In particular, every\n    nonpositive local submartingale $X$ for which $X_{t_0}$ is\n    integrable is a submartingale. Similarly every nonnegative\n    supermartingale $X$ such that $X_{t_0}$ is integrable is a\n    supermartingale.\n\n3.  An increasing and non-negative process $X$ is *locally integrable*\n    if it is locally an integrable process. That is, there is a sequence\n    of stopping times $\\tau_n$ increasing to infinity and such that\n    $\\mathbb{E}[1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}|X_{\\tau_n\\wedge t}|]<\\infty$ for\n    every $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$. By monotonicity of\n    $X$, this is equivalent to\n    $\\mathbb{E}[1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}|X_{\\tau_n}|]<\\infty$. For example,\n    the maximum process $X^*_t\\equiv\\sup_{s\\le t}|X_s|$ of a local\n    martingale $X$ is locally integrable.\n\n4.  A process $X$ is said to be *locally bounded* if there is a sequence\n    of stopping times $\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to infinity and\n    such that $1_{\\{\\tau_n\\ge t_0\\}}X^{\\tau_n}$ are uniformly bounded\n    processes. For example, in discrete-time so\n    $\\mathbb{T}=\\mathbb{Z}_+$, then every predictable process is locally\n    bounded.\n\nSimilarly, in continuous-time, if $\\pi$ is a property of stochastic\nprocesses and $X$ is a stochastic process such that the left limits of\n$X_t$ with respect to $t$ exist everywhere, then $X$ is said to\n*prelocally* satisfy $\\pi$ if there is a sequence of stopping times\n$\\tau_n$ almost surely increasing to infinity and such that the\nprestopped processes $1_{\\{\\tau_n>t_0\\}}X^{\\tau_n-}$ satisfy $\\pi$.",
