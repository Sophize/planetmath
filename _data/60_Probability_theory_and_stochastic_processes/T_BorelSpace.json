  "definition": "A [*Borel space*]{} $(X; \\mathcal{B}(X))$ is defined as a set $X$,\ntogether with a Borel $\\mathcal{B}(X)$ of subsets of $X$, called Borel\nsets. The Borel algebra on $X$ is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra\ncontaining all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets if the\ntopology on closed sets is selected).\n\nBorel sets were named after the French mathematician Emile Borel.\n\nA subspace of a Borel space $(X; \\mathcal{B} (X))$ is a subset\n$S \\subset X$ endowed with the relative Borel structure, that is the\n$\\sigma$-algebra of all subsets of $S$ of the form $S \\bigcap E$, where\n$E$ is a Borel subset of $X$.\n\nA *rigid Borel space* $(X_r; \\mathcal{B} (X_r))$ is defined as a Borel\nspace whose only automorphism $f: X_r \\to X_r$ (that is, with $f$ being\na bijection, and also with $f(A) = f^{-1}(A)$ for any\n$A \\in \\mathcal{B}(X_r)$) is the identity function\n$1_{(X_r; \\mathcal{B}(X_r))}$ (ref.[@BA91]).\n\nR.
