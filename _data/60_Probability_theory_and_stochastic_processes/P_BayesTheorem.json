  "statement": "Let $(A_n)$ be a sequence of mutually exclusive events whose is the\nsample space and let $E$ be any event. All of the events have nonzero\nprobability ($P(E) > 0$ and $P(A_n) > 0$ for all $n$). Bayes\u2019 Theorem\nstates\n\n$$P(A_j|E) = \\frac{P(A_j)P(E|A_j)}{\\sum_i P(A_i)P(E|A_i)}$$\n\nfor any $A_j \\in (A_n)$.\n\nA simpler formulation is:\n\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nFor two events, $A$ and $B$ (also with nonzero probability).\n\n[3]{} Milton, J.S., Arnold, Jesse C., *Introduction to Probability and\nStatistics: Principles and Applications for Engineering and the\nComputing Sciences*, McGraw Hill, 1995.",
