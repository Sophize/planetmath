  "definition": "A predictable, or *previsible* stopping time is a random time which is\npossible to predict just before the event. Letting\n$(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+}$ be a on a measurable space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$, then, a stopping time $\\tau$ is predictable if\nthere exists an increasing sequence of stopping times $\\tau_n$\nsatisfying the following.\n\n-   $\\tau_n<\\tau$ whenever $\\tau>0$.\n\n-   $\\tau_n\\rightarrow\\tau$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n\nThe sequence $\\tau_n$ is said to announce or foretell $\\tau$.\n\nFor example, if $X$ is a continuous adapted process with $X_0=0$, such\nas Brownian motion, then the first time $\\tau$ at which it hits a given\nlevel $K\\not=0$ is a predictable stopping time. In this case, if\n$\\tau_n$ is the first time at which $X$ hits the level $K(1-1/n)$, then\nthe sequence $\\tau_n$ announces $\\tau$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $X$ is a Poisson process then the first time\n$\\tau$ at which it is nonzero is not predictable. To show this, suppose\nthat $\\tau_n<\\tau$ are stopping times. The fact that $X_t-\\lambda t$ is\na martingale means that Doob\u2019s optional sampling theorem can be applied,\ngiving $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_n}-\\lambda\\tau_n]=0$. Then, $X_t=0$ for\n$t<\\tau$ gives $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_n]=0$. So, $\\tau_n=0$ with probability\none, and the sequence $\\tau_n$ cannot announce $\\tau$.\n\nIn discrete time, where the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ has time $t$\nrunning over the index set $\\mathbb{Z}_+$, then a stopping time is said\nto be predictable if $\\{\\tau\\le t\\}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$-measurable\nfor every time $t=1,2,\\ldots$.\n\nThis can be generalized to an arbitrary index set $\\mathbb{T}$, where a\nstopping time $\\tau\\colon\\Omega\\rightarrow\\mathbb{T}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is\npredictable if there exists an increasing sequence of stopping times\n$\\tau_n\\le\\tau$ such that $\\tau_n<\\tau$ whenever $\\tau$ is not equal to\na minimal element of $\\mathbb{T}$, and $\\bigcap_n(\\tau_n,\\tau)$ contains\nno elements of $\\mathbb{T}$.",
