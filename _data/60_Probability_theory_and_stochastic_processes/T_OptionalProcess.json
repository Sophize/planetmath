  "definition": "Suppose we are given a $(\\mathcal{F})_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ on a measurable\nspace $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$. A stochastic process is said to be adapted\nif $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for every time $t$ in the index\nset $\\mathbb{T}$. For an arbitrary, uncountable, index set\n$\\mathbb{T}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$, this property is too restrictive to be\nuseful. Instead, we can impose measurability conditions on $X$\nconsidered as a map from $\\mathbb{T}\\times\\Omega$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. For\ninstance, we could require $X$ to be progressively measurable, but that\nis still too weak a condition for many purposes. A stronger condition is\nfor $X$ to be *optional*. The index set $\\mathbb{T}$ is assumed to be a\nclosed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ in the following definition.\n\nThe class of optional processes forms the smallest set containing all\nadapted and right-continuous processes, and which is closed under taking\nlimits of sequences of processes.\n\nThe $\\sigma$-algebra, $\\mathcal{O}$, on $\\mathbb{T}\\times\\Omega$\ngenerated by the right-continuous and adapted processes is called the\n*optional* $\\sigma$-algebra. Then, a process is optional if and only if\nit is $\\mathcal{O}$-measurable.\n\nAlternatively, the optional $\\sigma$-algebra may be defined as\n$$\\mathcal{O}=\\sigma\\left(\\left\\{[T,\\infty):T\\textrm{ is a stopping time}\\right\\}\\right).$$\nHere, $[T,\\infty)$ is a stochastic interval, consisting of the pairs\n$(t,\\omega)\\in\\mathbb{T}\\times\\Omega$ such that $T(\\omega)\\le t$. In\ncontinuous-time, the equivalence of these two definitions for\n$\\mathcal{O}$ does require mild conditions on the filtration \u2014 it is\nenough for $\\mathcal{F}_t$ to be universally complete.\n\nIn the discrete-time case where the index set $\\mathbb{T}$ countable,\nthen the definitions above imply that a process $X_t$ is optional if and\nonly if it is adapted.",
