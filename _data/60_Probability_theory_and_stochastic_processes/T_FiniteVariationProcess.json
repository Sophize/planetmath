  "definition": "In the theory of stochastic processes, the term *finite-variation\nprocess* is used to refer to a process $X_t$ whose paths are\nright-continuous and have finite total variation over every compact time\ninterval, with probability one. See, for example, the Poisson process.\n\nIt can be shown that any function on the real numbers with finite total\nvariation has left and right limits everywhere. Consequently, finite\nvariation processes are always cadlag.",
