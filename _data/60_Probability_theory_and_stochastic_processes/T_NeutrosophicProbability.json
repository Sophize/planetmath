  "definition": "*Neutrosophic probability* is a probability in which\n\n-   the chance that an event $\\mathfrak{A}$ occurs is $T$;\n\n-   the indeterminate chance (i.e. neither occurring nor not-occurring,\n    unknown chance) is $I$;\n\n-   and the chance that the event does not occur is $F$;\n\nwhere $T, I, F$ are standard or non-standard real subsets of the\nnon-standard unit interval $]^-0, 1^+[$. We note the neutrosophic\nprobability $NP(\\mathfrak{A}) = (T, I, F)$, and $T, I, F$ are called\n*neutrosophic probabilistic components*.\n\nNow let\u2019s explain the previous notations: A number $\\varepsilon$ is said\nto be *infinitesimal* if and only if for all positive integers $n$ one\nhas $|\\varepsilon| < \\frac{1}{n}$. Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be a such\ninfinitesimal number. The *hyper-real number set* is an extension of the\nreal number set, which includes classes of infinite numbers and classes\nof infinitesimal numbers. Generally, for any real number $a$ one defines\n$^-a$ which signifies a *monad*, i.e. a set of hyper-real numbers in\nnon-standard analysis, as follows:\n$^-a = \\{a-\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$, and similarly one defines $a^+$, which is also a\nmonad, as: $a^+ = \\{a+\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$. A *binad* $^-a^+$ is a union of the above two\nmonads, i.e. $ ^-a^+ = ^-a \\cup a^+$. For example: The non-standard\nfinite number $1^+ = 1+\\varepsilon$, where $1$ is its *standard part*\nand $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*, and similarly the\nnon-standard finite number $^-0 = 0-\\varepsilon$, where $0$ is its\nstandard part and $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*. Similarly for\n$3^+ = 3+ \\varepsilon$, etc. Note that $] ^-0, 1^+ [$ is called the\n*non-standard unit interval*. More information on hyperreal intervals .\n\nThe superior sum of the neutrosophic components is defined as\n$$n_{sup} = sup(T) + sup(I) + sup(F) \\in ] ^-0, 3^+[$$ which may be as\nhigh as 3 or $3^+$. While the inferior sum of the neutrosophic\ncomponents is defined as\n$$n_{inf} = inf(T) + inf(I) + inf(F) \\in ] ^-0, 3^+[$$ which may be as\nlow as 0 or $^-0$.\n\nNeutrosophic probability was introduced by Florentin Smarandache in 1995\nand this entry contains excerpts from his below book which is for free\nonline. NP is a generalization of (a) *classical probability*, i.e. when\nthe set $I$ is empty and the other two probabilistic components are each\nreduced to a crisp number: $t \\in T$ and it is understood that $f \\in F$\nsuch that $t+f = 1$, and (b) *imprecise probability*, i.e. when the set\n$I$ is also empty, but $T \\subset [0, 1]$ is a subset with an upper\nbound and a lower bound, not a crisp number $p \\in [0, 1]$, while $F$ is\nunderstood to be the opposite of $T$. Unlike the classical probability\nand imprecise probability, which both use the standard unit interval\n$[0, 1]$, neutrosophic probability uses the non-standard unit interval\n$]^-0, 1^+[$ in order to make a distinction between *absolutely sure\nevent*, which is an event that occurs in all possible worlds, and\n*relatively sure event*, which is an event that occurs in at least one\nworld. Similarly for *absolutely unsure event* and *relatively unsure\nevent*, or *absolutely indeterminate event* and *relatively\nindeterminate event*.\n\nThe universal set, endowed with a neutrosophic probability defined for\neach of its subset, forms a *neutrosophic probability space*.\n\n[**Four examples**]{}: a) From a pool of refugees, waiting in a\npolitical refugee camp in Turkey to get the American visa, $a\\%$ have\nthe chance to be accepted - where $a$ varies in the set $A$, $r\\%$ to be\nrejected - where $r$ varies in the set $R$, and $p\\%$ to be in pending\n(not yet decided) - where $p$ varies in $P$, with the sets\n$A, R, P \\subset [0,1]$. In technical applications, where there is no\nneed for distinctions between absolutely sure event and relatively sure\nevent, we can use standard subsets instead of non-standard subsets and\nrespectively the unit interval $[0,1]$ instead of the non-standard unit\ninterval $]^-0, 1^+[$. b) The probability that candidate $C$ will win an\nelection is say 0.25-0.30 true (percent of people voting for him), 0.35\nfalse (percent of people voting against him), and 0.40 or 0.41\nindeterminate (percent of people not coming to the ballot box, or giving\na blank vote i.e. not selecting anyone, or giving a negative vote i.e.\ncutting all candidates on the list). c) The probability that tomorrow it\nwill rain is say 0.50-0.54 true according to meteorologists who have\ninvestigated the past years\u2019 weather, 0.30 or 0.34-0.35 false according\nto today\u2019s very sunny and droughty summer, and 0.10 or 0.20 undecided\n(indeterminate) because of some unexpected and unknown parameters. d)\nThe probability that Yankees will win tomorrow versus Cowboys is 0.60\ntrue (according to their confrontation\u2019s history giving Yankees\u2019\nsatisfaction), 0.30-0.32 false (supposing Cowboys are actually up to the\nmark, while Yankees are declining), and 0.10 or 0.11 or 0.12\nindeterminate (left to the hazard: sickness of players, referee\u2019s\nmistakes, atmospheric conditions during the game). These parameters act\non players\u2019 psychology.\n\n[**Remarks**]{}: - Neutrosophic probability are useful to those events\nwhich involve some degree of indeterminacy (unknown) and more criteria\nof evaluation as above. This kind of probability is necessary because it\nprovides a better approach than classical probability to uncertain\nevents. - This probability uses a subset-approximation for the\ntruth-value (like imprecise probability), but also subset-approximations\nfor indeterminacy- and falsity-values. - In the case when the truth and\nfalse components are complementary, i.e. no indeterminacy exists and the\nsum of the neutrosophic components is 1, one falls to the classical\nprobability. As, for example, tossing dice or coins, or drawing cards\nfrom a well shuffled deck, or drawing balls from an urn.\n\n[9]{} S.
