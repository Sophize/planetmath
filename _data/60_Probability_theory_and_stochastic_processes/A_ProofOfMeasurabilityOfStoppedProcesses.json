  "argumentText": "Let $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{T}}$ be a on the measurable space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$, $\\tau$ be a stopping time, and $X$ be a\nstochastic process. We prove the following measurability properties of\nthe stopped process $X^\\tau$.\n\n[**If $X$ is jointly measurable then so is $X^\\tau$.**]{}\n\nSuppose first that $X$ is a process of the form $X_t=1_A1_{\\{t\\ge s\\}}$\nfor some $A\\in\\mathcal{F}$ and $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$. Then,\n$X^\\tau_t=1_{A\\cap\\{\\tau\\ge s\\}}1_{\\{t\\ge s\\}}$ is\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{T})\\otimes\\mathcal{F}$-measurable. By the\nfunctional monotone class theorem, it follows that $X^\\tau$ is a bounded\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{T})\\otimes\\mathcal{F}$-measurable process whenever\n$X$ is. By taking limits of bounded processes, this generalizes to all\njointly measurable processes.\n\n[**If $X$ is progressively measurable then so is $X^\\tau$.**]{}\n\nFor any given $t\\in\\mathbb{T}$, let $Y$ be the\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{T})\\otimes\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable process\n$Y_s= X^t_s=X_{s\\wedge t}$. As $\\tau\\wedge t$ is\n$\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, the result proven above says that\n$(X^\\tau)^t=Y^{\\tau\\wedge t}$ will also be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{T})\\otimes\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, so $X^\\tau$ is\nprogressive.\n\n[**If $X$ is optional then so is $X^\\tau$.**]{}\n\nAs the optional processes are generated by the right-continuous and\nadapted processes then it is enough to prove this result when $X$ is\nright-continuous and adapted. Clearly, $X^\\tau$ will be\nright-continuous. Also, $X$ will be progressive (see measurability of\nstochastic processes) and, by the result proven above, it follows that\n$X^\\tau$ is progressive and, in particular, is adapted.\n\n[**If $X$ is predictable then so is $X^\\tau$.**]{}\n\nBy the definition of predictable processes, it is enough to prove the\nresult in the cases where $X_t=1_A1_{\\{t>s\\}}$ for some $s\\in\\mathbb{T}$\nand $A\\in\\mathcal{F}_s$, and $X_t=1_A1_{\\{t=t_0\\}}$ where $t_0$ is the\nminimal element of $\\mathbb{T}$ and $A\\in\\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$.\n\nIn the first case, $X^\\tau_t=1_{A\\cap\\{\\tau>s\\}}1_{\\{t>s\\}}$ is\npredictable and, in the second case,\n$X^\\tau_t=1_{A}1_{\\{t=t_0\\}}+1_{A\\cap\\{\\tau=t_0\\}}1_{\\{t>t_0\\}}$ is\npredictable.",
