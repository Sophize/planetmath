  "definition": "We present a definition of the stochastic integral of a predictable\nprocess with respect to a general real-valued semimartingale. In the\nliterature on stochastic calculus there are actually several different\ndifferent definitions available, often based on specific constructions\nof the integral in terms of decompositions of the semimartingale into a\nsum of a local martingale and a finite variation process. The approach\ntaken here is to instead define the integral in terms of its most basic\nproperties \u2014 in particular that it satisfies the expected\ngeneralizations of standard non-stochastic integration, namely linearity\nand dominated convergence. Unlike in standard calculus, where the value\nof an integral is a real number, here the value is a random variable.\n\nMany stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, have paths which are\nnowhere differentiable and have infinite total variation over finite\ntime intervals. In such cases, standard definitions of integration, such\nas the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, cannot be used. However, by only\nconsidering predictable integrands and by relaxing properties such as\ndominated convergence to only require convergence in probability, the\nstochastic integral is a well-defined quantity.\n\nStochastic integration as described here is sometimes referred to as the\nIt\u00f6 or forward integral, in order to distinguish it from the backward\nand Stratonovich integrals.\n\nLet $X$ be a semimartingale defined with respect to a filtered\nprobability space\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+},\\mathbb{P})$.\nThen, for a predictable process $\\xi$, the stochastic integral of $\\xi$\nwith respect to $X$ is a c\u00e0dl\u00e0g process $$t\\mapsto\\int_0^t\\xi\\,dX.$$ For\neach fixed time $t$, this is a random variable defined on the measurable\nspace $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})$.\n\nFor bounded integrands, the integral satisfies the following properties.\n\n1.  \\[elementary\\] (Elementary integrands) For any time\n    $T\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$ and bounded, $\\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable random\n    variable $A$, a predictable process satisfying $\\xi_t=1_{\\{t>T\\}}A$\n    over $t>0$ has the integral\n    $$\\int_0^t\\xi\\,dX = A1_{\\{t>T\\}}(X_t-X_T)\\ \\textrm{(almost surely)}.$$\n\n2.  (Linearity) If $\\alpha,\\beta$ are bounded and predictable processes\n    and $\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ then $$\\label{eq:linearity}\n    \\int_0^t\\left(\\lambda\\alpha+\\mu\\beta\\right)\\,dX = \\lambda\\int_0^t\\alpha\\,dX+\\mu\\int_0^t\\beta\\,dX\\ \\textrm{(almost surely).}$$\n\n3.  (Bounded convergence in probability) If $(\\xi^n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$\n    is a sequence of predictable processes such that $|\\xi^n|\\le 1$ and\n    $\\xi^n\\rightarrow 0$ as $n$ tends to infinity then,\n    $$\\int_0^t\\xi^n\\,dX\\rightarrow 0$$ in probability as\n    $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, for each $t\\ge 0$.\n\nThese three properties uniquely define the integration for bounded\nintegrands. By linearity, property \\[elementary\\] above is equivalent to\nstating that the integral agrees with the explicit expression for\nelementary predictable integrands and then, by bounded convergence, that\nit agrees with the explicit expression for all simple predictable\nintegrands.\n\nThe stochastic integral can be extended to more general unbounded\npredictable integrands. A predictable process $\\xi$ is $X$-integrable if\nthe set of random variables\n$$\\left\\{\\int_0^t\\alpha\\,dX:|\\alpha|\\le |\\xi|\\textrm{ is bounded and predictable}\\right\\}$$\nis bounded in probability for every $t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$. The set of all\n$X$-integrable processes is sometimes denoted by $L^1(X)$. By bounded\nconvergence in probability, this contains all bounded predictable\nprocesses, and it is easily shown that the set of $X$-integrable\nprocesses are closed under taking linear combinations. Furthermore,\nregardless of the specific semimartingale under consideration, every\nlocally bounded predictable process will be $X$-integrable.\n\nThe stochastic integral of arbitrary integrands in $L^1(X)$ is the\nunique extension from bounded predictable integrands described above\nsuch that linearity (\\[eq:linearity\\]) holds, and the following\ndominated convergence result holds. If $\\xi$ is $X$-integrable and\n$(\\xi^n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of $X$-integrable processes\nsuch that $|\\xi^n|\\le|\\xi|$ and $\\xi^n\\rightarrow 0$ then\n$$\\int_0^t\\xi^n\\,dX\\rightarrow 0$$ in probability as\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$, for each $t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$.\n\nFor any semimartingale $X$ and $X$-integrable process $\\xi$, the\nintegral is sometimes denoted by $\\xi\\cdot X$,\n$$(\\xi\\cdot X)_t\\equiv\\int_0^t\\xi\\,dX.$$ Alternatively, stochastic\nintegrals are often written in differential form. That is,\n$$dY=\\xi\\,dX$$ is equivalent to stating that $Y_t-Y_0=\\int_0^t\\xi\\,dX$\nfor each $t>0$.\n\n[9]{} K. Bichteler, *Stochastic integration with jumps*.
