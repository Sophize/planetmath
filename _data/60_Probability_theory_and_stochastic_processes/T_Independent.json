  "definition": "In a probability space, we say that the random events $A_1,\\dots,A_n$\nare *independent* if\n$$P(A_{i_1}\\cap A_{i_2}\\cap\\dots\\cap A_{i_k}) = P(A_{i_1})\\dots P(A_{i_k})$$\nfor all $i_1,\\dots,i_k$ such that $1\\leq i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_k\\leq n$.\n\nAn arbitrary family of random events is independent if every finite\nsubfamily is independent.\n\nThe random variables $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ are independent if, given any Borel\nsets $B_1,\\dots,B_n$, the random events\n$[X_1\\in B_1],\\dots,[X_n\\in B_n]$ are independent. This is equivalent to\nsaying that\n\n$$F_{X_1,\\dots,X_n} = F_{X_1}\\dots F_{X_n}$$\n\nwhere $F_{X_1},\\dots, F_{X_n}$ are the distribution functions of\n$X_1,\\dots, X_n$, respectively, and $F_{X_1,\\dots,X_n}$ is the joint\ndistribution function. When the density functions\n$f_{X_1},\\dots,f_{X_n}$ and $f_{X_1,\\dots,X_n}$ exist, an equivalent\ncondition for independence is that\n\n$$f_{X_1,\\dots,X_n} = f_{X_1}\\dots f_{X_n}.$$\n\nAn arbitrary family of random variables is independent if every finite\nsubfamily is independent.",
