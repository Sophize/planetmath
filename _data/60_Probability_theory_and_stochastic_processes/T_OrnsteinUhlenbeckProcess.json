  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n----------\n\nThe *Ornstein-Uhlenbeck* process is a stochastic process that satisfies\nthe following stochastic differential equation: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq:sde}\ndX_t = \\kappa ( \\theta - X_t) \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t\\,,\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion on $t \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe constant parameters are:\n\n-   $\\kappa > 0$ is the rate of mean reversion;\n\n-   $\\theta$ is the long-term mean of the process;\n\n-   $\\sigma>0$ is the volatility or average magnitude, per square-root\n    time, of the random fluctuations that are modelled as Brownian\n    motions.\n\nMean-reverting property {#mean-reverting-property .unnumbered}\n-----------------------\n\nIf we ignore the random fluctuations in the process due to $dW_t$, then\nwe see that $X_t$ has an overall drift towards a mean value $\\theta$.\nThe process $X_t$ reverts to this mean exponentially, at rate $\\kappa$,\nwith a magnitude in direct proportion to the distance between the\ncurrent value of $X_t$ and $\\theta$.\n\nThis can be seen by looking at the solution to the ordinary differential\nequation $dx_t = \\kappa (\\theta - x) dt$ which is $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq:ode}\n\\frac{\\theta - x_t}{\\theta-x_0} = e^{-\\kappa(t-t_0) } \\,,\n\\quad \\text{ or } \nx_t = \\theta + (x_0 - \\theta) e^{-\\kappa(t-t_0) }\\,. \\end{aligned}$$\n\nFor this reason, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is also called a\n*mean-reverting process*, although the latter name applies to other\ntypes of stochastic processes exhibiting the same property as well.\n\nSolution {#solution .unnumbered}\n--------\n\nThe solution to the stochastic differential equation defining the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process is, for any $0 \\leq s \\leq t$, is\n$$X_t = \\theta + (X_s - \\theta) e^{-\\kappa (t-s)}\n+ \\sigma \\int_s^t e^{-\\kappa(t-u)} \\, dW_u\\,.$$ where the integral on\nthe right is the It\u00f4 integral.\n\nFor any fixed $s$ and $t$, the random variable $X_t$, conditional upon\n$X_s$, is normally distributed with\n$$\\text{mean} = \\theta + (X_s - \\theta) e^{-\\kappa(t-s)}\n\\,,\n\\quad\n\\text{variance} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\kappa} (1 - e^{-2\\kappa (t-s)})\\,.$$\nObserve that the mean of $X_t$ is exactly the value derived\nheuristically in the solution of the ODE.\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a time-homogeneous It\u00f4 diffusion.\n\nApplications {#applications .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is widely used for modelling biological\nprocesses such as neuronal response, and in mathematical finance, the\nmodelling of the dynamics of interest rates and volatilities of asset\nprices.\n\n[6]{} Martin Jacobsen. \u201cLaplace and the Origin of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nProcess\u201d.
