  "definition": "A *central chi-squared random variable* $X$ with $n>0$ degrees of\nfreedom is given by the probability density function\n$$f_X(x) = \\frac{ (\\frac{1}{2})^{\\frac{n}{2}} } {\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})}\n           x^{\\frac{n}{2} - 1} e^{- \\frac{1}{2} x}$$ for $x > 0$, where\n$\\Gamma$ represents the gamma function.\n\nThe parameter $n$ is usually, but not always, an integer, in which case\nthe distribution is that of the sum of the squares of a sequence of $n$\nindependent standard $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$,\n$$X=X_1^2+X_2^2+\\cdots+X_n^2.$$\n\nParameters: $n\\in(0,\\infty)$.\n\nSyntax: $X\\sim \\chi_{(n)}^{2}$\n\n![Densities of the chi-squared distribution for different degrees of\nfreedom.](chisquared)\n\nNotes:\n\n1.  This distribution is very widely used in statistics, such as in\n    hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n\n2.  The chi-squared distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom is a result\n    of evaluating the gamma distribution with $\\alpha = \\frac{n}{2}$ and\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3.  $E[X] = n$\n\n4.  $\\Var[X] = 2n$\n\n5.  The moment generating function is\n    $$M_X(t) = \\left(1 - 2t\\right)^{-\\frac{n}{2}},$$ and is defined for\n    all $t\\in\\mathbb{C}$ with less than $1/2$.\n\n6.  The sum of independent $\\chi_{(m)}^2$ and $\\chi_{(n)}^2$ random\n    variables has the $\\chi_{(m+n)}^2$ distribution.",
