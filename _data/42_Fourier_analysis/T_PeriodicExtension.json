  "definition": "Let $f$ be a function defined on some real interval $[a,b]$. By a\n*periodic extension* of $f$ to the real line we mean a function $g$ such\nthat\n\n1.  $g$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ except perhaps at points $a+n(b-a)$,\n    where $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$;\n\n2.  $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in (a,b)$, and\n\n3.  $g(x+n(a-b))=g(x)$ for all $x\\in (a,b)$ and all integers $n$.\n\nThe best way to understand periodic extensions of a function is to look\nthe graph of a periodic extension of a real-valued function. For\nexample, let $f(x)=x$ be defined on $[-1,1]$. The graph of $f$ looks\nlike\n\n(-6,-2)(6,2) (0,0)(-5.5,-1.5)(5.5,1.5) (5.8,0)[$x$]{} (0.2,1.6)[$y$]{}\n(-1,-1)(1,1) (1,1)(-1,-1)\n\nThen the graph a periodic extension $g$ of $f$ may look like\n\n(-6,-2)(6,2) (0,0)(-5.5,-1.5)(5.5,1.5) (5.8,0)[$x$]{} (0.2,1.6)[$y$]{}\n(-5.5,0.5)(-5,1) (-5,-1)(-3,1) (-3,-1)(-1,1) (-1,-1)(1,1) (1,-1)(3,1)\n(3,-1)(5,1) (5,-1)(5.5,-0.5) (-1,-1)(-3,-1)(1,-1)(-5,-1)(3,-1)(5,-1)\n(1,1)(-1,1)(3,1)(-3,1)(5,1)(-5,1)\n\nor look like\n\n(-5.5,-2)(5.5,2) (0,0)(-5.5,-1.5)(5.5,1.5) (5.8,0)[$x$]{}\n(0.2,1.6)[$y$]{} (-5.5,0.5)(-5,1) (-5,-1)(-3,1) (-3,-1)(-1,1)\n(-1,-1)(1,1) (1,-1)(3,1) (3,-1)(5,1) (5,-1)(5.5,-0.5)\n(-1,-1)(1,1)(-3,-1)(-1,1)(1,-1)(3,1)(-5,-1)(-3,1)(3,-1)(5,1)(-5,1)(5,-1)\n(-1,0)(1,0)(-3,0)(3,0)(-5,0)(5,0)\n\nNotice the two periodic extensions of $f$ are identical except at odd\ninteger points on the $x$-axis. The reason why we do not require $g$ to\nagree with $f$ on the end points of $[a,b]$ is because we do not know if\n$f(a)=f(b)$. If they do not agree, requiring that $g=f$ on all of\n$[a,b]$ may result in points $a+n(b-a)$ getting mapped to two distinct\nvalues $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, rendering $g$ not well-defined. In fact, if\n$f$ does not agree on its endpoints, no periodic extensions of $f$ are\ncontinuous.\n\nNotice, also, that the domain of function $f$ does not have to be the\nentire closed interval $[a,b]$. The domain of $f$ may very well be a\nsubset $S\\subseteq [a,b]$. For example, $f(x)=x$ may be a function\ndefined on the open interval $(-1,1)$. The two graphs above are again\ngraphs of periodic extensions of $f$.\n\nHowever, if $S$ is a proper subset of $[a,b]$ that is not the open\ninterval $(a,b)$, then the definition of a periodic extension needs to\nbe modified: $g$ is a periodic extension of $f$ defined on\n$S\\subseteq [a,b]$ if\n\n1.  $g$ is defined on a subset $T\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ except perhaps at\n    points $a+n(b-a)$, where $T=\\lbrace x+n(a-b)\\mid x\\in S\\rbrace$ and\n    $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$;\n\n2.  $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in S-\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and\n\n3.  $g(x+n(a-b))=g(x)$ for all $x\\in S-\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ and all\n    integers $n$.\n\nWe generally assume that $a=\\inf S$ and $b=\\sup S$.\n\nFor example, if $f(x)=x$ for all rational numbers $x\\in [-1,1]$, then a\nperiodic extension of $f$ has its domain the set of all rational numbers\nexcept perhaps at are odd integers.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Trigonometric functions defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ are periodic\n    extensions of the trigonometric functions defined for angles in the\n    interval $[0,2\\pi]$.\n\n-   Suppose $f$ is defined either on a closed interval $[a,b]$ or an\n    open interval $(a,b)$, $f$ has a continuous periodic extension\n    (defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$) iff $f$ is continuous and that\n\n    1.  either $f(a)=f(b)$ when $f$ is defined on a closed interval, or\n\n    2.  $f(a+)=f(b-)$ when $f$ is defined on an open interval, where\n        $f(a+)$ is the one-sided limit approaching $a$ from the right,\n        and $f(b-)$ is the one-sided limit approaching $b$ from the\n        left.\n\n    Simply define the periodic extension $g$ so that either $g(a)=f(a)$,\n    or $g(a)=f(a+)$. For example, the following graph\n\n    (-6,-0.5)(6,2) (0,0)(-5.5,-0.5)(5.5,1.5) (5.8,0)[$x$]{}\n    (0.2,1.6)[$y$]{} (-5.5,0.5)(-5,1) (-5,1)(-4,0) (-4,0)(-3,1)\n    (-3,1)(-2,0) (-2,0)(-1,1) (-1,1)(0,0) (0,0)(1,1) (1,1)(2,0)\n    (2,0)(3,1) (3,1)(4,0) (4,0)(5,1) (5,1)(5.5,0.5)\n\n    is the graph of the continuous periodic extension of a function\n    $f_1$ given by $f_1(x)=|x|$ defined on $(-1,1)$, or a function $f_2$\n    defined on $(0,2)$, given by $f_2(x)=x$ for $0<x\\le 1$ and\n    $f_2(x)=2-x$ for $1\\le x<2$. With $f_1$, we see that\n    $f_1(-1+)=f_1(1-)=1$, while with $f_2$, we have $f_2(0+)=f_2(2-)=0$.\n\n    It is easy to see that if a continuous periodic extension of a\n    function exists, then it is unique.\n\n-   Higher dimensional periodic extensions may also be defined for\n    functions defined on a parallelepiped ($n$-dimensional analog of a\n    parallelogram). A periodic extension $g$ of a function $f$ defined\n    on a parallelepiped is a function such that its projection $p_i(g)$\n    onto axis $i$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a periodic extension of the\n    projection $p_i(f)$ of $f$ onto axis $i$.\n\n[9]{} G.P.
