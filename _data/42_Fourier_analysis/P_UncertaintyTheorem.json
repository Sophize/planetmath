  "statement": "The uncertainty principle, as first formulated by Heisenberg, states\nthat the product of the standard deviations of two [*conjugated*]{}\nvariables, cannot be less than some minimum. This statement has been\ngeneralized to a precise mathematical theorem, in the frame of\n[*wavelet*]{} theory.\n\nTHE UNCERTAINTY THEOREM\n=======================\n\nLet $f(t)$ be a real function of the real variable, satisfying the $L^2$\ncondition (see below), and $F(\\omega)$ its Fourier transform. The\nstandard deviation $\\Delta_t$ and $\\Delta_\\omega$ of $t$ and $\\omega$\nrespectively, satisfy the following inequality:\n$$\\Delta_t\\Delta_\\omega\\geq\\frac{1}{2}$$ For this formula to make sense,\n$\\Delta_t$ and $\\Delta_\\omega$ must be precisely defined.\n\nTHE [$L^2$]{} CONDITION\n=======================\n\nA real function $f(t)$ of the real variable $t$ will be said to satisfy\nthe $L^2$ condition if $f(t)$, $tf(t)$ and the derivative $f'(t)$ are\nall in $L^2$. If $F(\\omega)$ is its Fourier transform,\n$-i\\omega F(\\omega)$ is the transform of $f'(t)$. All the following\nfunctions belong to $L^2$:\n$$f(t),~f'(t),~tf(t),~F(\\omega),~\\omega F(\\omega)$$ The first three\nfunctions are just the definition and the two last ones result from\nParseval\u2019s identity, recalled here in its integral form:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\overline{U(\\omega)}V(\\omega) d\\omega~=~2\\pi\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\overline{u(t)}v(t) dt$$\n$U(\\omega)$ and $V(\\omega)$ are the Fourier transforms of $u(t)$ and\n$v(t)$.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\n$f(t)$ and $F(\\omega)$ being in $L^2$, we may define their finite norms:\n$$\\mid\\mid f \\mid\\mid ^2  = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mid f(t) \\mid ^2 dt ~~~~~~~~ \\mid\\mid F \\mid\\mid ^2  = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mid F(\\omega) \\mid ^2 d\\omega$$\nBy Parseval\u2019s identity, they are related:\n$$\\mid\\mid f \\mid\\mid ^2  = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\mid\\mid F \\mid\\mid ^2$$ We\nare now able to define the probability distributions $T(t)$ and\n$\\Omega(\\omega)$ for the \u201crandom\u201d variables $t$ and $\\omega$:\n$$T(t) = \\frac{\\mid\\ f(t) \\mid ^2}{\\mid\\mid f \\mid\\mid ^2} ~~~~~~~~\n\\Omega(\\omega) = \\frac{\\mid\\ F(\\omega) \\mid ^2}{\\mid\\mid F \\mid\\mid ^2}$$\nSince the $L^2$ integrals of $T$ and $\\Omega$ are 1, they are proper\nprobability distributions. The [*mean value*]{} $t_0$ of $t$ is defined\nthe usual way: $$t_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}tT(t)dt$$ Note that\n$\\omega$\u2019s mean value is always 0 because $f(t)$ is a real function.\nFinally, we have the standard deviations for the uncertainty theorem:\n$$\\Delta_t^2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty T(t)(t-t_0)^2dt ~~~~~~~~\n\\Delta_{\\omega}^2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\Omega(\\omega)(t-t_0)^2d\\omega$$\n\nPROOF OF THE THEOREM\n====================\n\nThe heart of the proof is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the $L^2$\nHilbert space: the product of the norms of two functions $u(t)$ and\n$v(t)$ is greater than, or equal to, the norm of their scalar product:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\mid u(t)\\mid ^2 dt\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\mid v(t)\\mid ^2 dt ~~~\\geq~~~\n\\mid \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\overline{u(t)} v(t) dt\\mid ^2$$ Equality\noccurs if, and only if, one of the functions is proportional to the\nother. For the two functions $u(t) = (t-t_0)f(t)$ and $v(t) = f'(t)$, we\nhave therefore:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)^2 f(t)^2 dt \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f'(t)^2 dt   ~~~\\geq~~~  \\mid\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)f(t)f'(t)dt \\mid ^2$$\nThe integral at the right hand side can be integrated by parts. Using\nthe definition of $\\mid\\mid f\\mid\\mid$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)^2 f(t)^2 dt \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f'(t)^2 dt   ~~~\\geq~~~ \\frac{1}{4}\\mid\\mid f\\mid\\mid^4$$\nBut $\\mid\\mid f\\mid\\mid$ and $\\mid\\mid F\\mid\\mid$ are related by a\n$2\\pi$ factor, so:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)^2 f(t)^2 dt \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f'(t)^2 dt   ~~~\\geq~~~ \\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\mid\\mid f\\mid\\mid^2\\mid\\mid F\\mid\\mid^2$$\nApplying Parseval\u2019s identity to the second integral of the left hand\nside, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)^2 f(t)^2 dt \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\omega^2\nF(\\omega)^2 d\\omega ~~~\\geq~~~ \\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\mid\\mid f\\mid\\mid^2\\mid\\mid F\\mid\\mid^2$$\nWe have used the fact that the Fourier transform of $f'(t)$ if\n$-i\\omega F(\\omega)$. Now, dividing both sides by the norms, and\nsimplifying by the $2\\pi$ factor, we get exactly the uncertainty\ntheorem:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (t-t_0)^2 T(t) dt \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\omega^2\nF(\\omega)^2 d\\omega   ~~~\\geq~~~ \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTHE GAUSSIAN FUNCTION\n=====================\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality becomes an equality if, and only if, one\nof the functions is proportional to the other. In our case, this\ncondition is expressed by $f'(t)=\\lambda(t-t_0)f(t)$ where $\\lambda$ is\na constant. This differential equation is readily solved:\n$f(t)=ke^{\\lambda (t-t_0)^2}$. $f(t)$ must be in $L^2$ so that $\\lambda$\nmust be negative. Defining $\\lambda = \\frac{-1}{2\\sigma^2}$, we get the\ngaussian function in its traditional form:\n$$f(t)=e^{\\frac{-(t-t_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$$ The constant $k$ has been\nomitted because it cancels anyway in the probability distributions. The\nstandard deviations are easily computed from their definitions:\n$$\\Delta_t = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}} \\hspace{32pt} \\Delta_\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$$\nTheir product is $\\frac{1}{2}$, independent of $\\sigma$. There is no\nother function with this property.\n\n[1]{} Roberto Celi [*Time-Frequency visualization of helicopter\nnoise*]{} http://celi.umd.edu/Jour/NoisePaperColor.pdfDespite its\nfrightening title, this paper is mostly theoretical and it is the only\nplace where I saw the uncertainty theorem clearly stated.
