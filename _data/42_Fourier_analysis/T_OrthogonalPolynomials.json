  "definition": "Orthogonal Polynomials\n======================\n\nPolynomials of degree $n$ are analytic functions that can be written in\nthe form\n\n$$p_n(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots + a_n x^n$$\n\nThey can be differentiated and integrated for any value of $x$, and are\nfully determined by the $n+1$ coefficients $a_0 \\ldots a_n$ . For this\nsimplicity they are frequently used to approximate more complicated or\nunknown functions. In approximations, the necessary degree $n$ of the\npolynomial is not normally defined by criteria other than the quality of\nthe approximation.\n\nUsing polynomials as defined above tends to lead into numerical\ndifficulties when determining the $a_i$, even for small values of $n$.\nIt is therefore customary to stabilize results numerically by using\northogonal polynomials over an interval $[a,b]$, defined with respect to\na positive weighting function $W(x) > 0$ by\n\n$$\\int_a^b p_n(x)p_m(x) W(x) dx = 0 \\; \\text{for} \\; n \\ne m$$\n\nOrthogonal polynomials are obtained in the following way: define the\nscalar product.\n\n$$(f,g) = \\int_a^b f(x)g(x)W(x) dx$$\n\nbetween the functions $f$ and $g$, where $W(x)$ is a weight factor.\nStarting with the polynomials $p_0(x)=1$, $p_1(x)=x$, $p_2(x)=x^2$,\netc., from the Gram-Schmidt decomposition one obtains a sequence of\northogonal polynomials $q_0(x),q_1(x),\\ldots$, such that\n$(q_m,q_n)=N_n \\delta_{mn}$. The normalization factors $N_n$ are\narbitrary. When all $N_i$ are equal to one, the polynomials are called\northonormal.\n\nSome important orthogonal polynomials are:\n\n      $a$        $b$           $W(x)$       name\n  ----------- ---------- ------------------ -----------------------\n      -1          1              1          Legendre polynomials\n      -1          1       $(1-x^2)^{-1/2}$  Chebyshev polynomials\n   $-\\infty$   $\\infty$      $e^{-x^2}$     Hermite polynomials\n\nOrthogonal polynomials of successive orders can be expressed by a\nrecurrence relation\n\n$$p_n = (A_n + B_n x) p_{n-1} + C_n p_{n-2}$$\n\nThis relation can be used to compute a finite series\n\n$$a_0 p_0 + a_1 p_1 + \\cdots + a_np_n$$\n\nwith arbitrary coefficients $a_i$, without computing explicitly every\npolynomial $p_j$ (Horner\u2019s Rule).\n\nChebyshev polynomials $T_n(x)$ are also orthogonal with respect to\ndiscrete values $x_i$:\n\n$$\\sum_i T_n(x_i)T_m(x_i) = 0 \\; \\text{for} \\; n < m \\le M$$\n\nwhere the $x_i$ depend on $M$.\n\nFor more information, see [@Abramowitz74; @Press95].\n\n[3]{}\n\nOriginally from The Data Analysis Briefbook ()\n\nM.
