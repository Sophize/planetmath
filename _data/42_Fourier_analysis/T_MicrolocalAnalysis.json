  "definition": "In mathematical analysis, [*microlocal analysis*]{} is a term use to\ndescribe techniques developed from the 1950s onwards based on Fourier\ntransforms related to the study of variable-coefficients-linear and\nnonlinear partial differential equations. This includes generalized\nfunctions, pseudo-differential operators, wave front sets, Fourier\nintegral operators, and paradifferential operators.\n\nThe term microlocal implies localisation not just at a point, but in\nterms of cotangent space directions at a given point. This gains in\nimportance on manifolds of dimension greater than one.\n\n[*This entry was adapted from the Wikipedia article as of January 17,\n2007.*]{}",
