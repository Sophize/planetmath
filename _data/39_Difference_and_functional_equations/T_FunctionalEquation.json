  "definition": "A *functional equation* is an equation whose unknowns are functions.\n\n$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y),\\quad f(x\\cdot y) = f(x) \\cdot f(y)$ are examples\nof such equations. The systematic study of these didn\u2019t begin before the\n1960\u2019s, although various mathematicians have been studying them before,\nincluding Euler and Cauchy just to mention a few.\n\nFunctional equations appear many , for example, the gamma function and\nRiemann\u2019s zeta function both satisfy functional equations.",
