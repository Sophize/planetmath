  "definition": "In numerical work involving divided differences, when computing the\ndivided differences of a tabulated function, it is convenient to arrange\nthe divided differences of a function $f$ in a table like so:\n$$\\begin{matrix}\nx_0 & f(x_0) &&& \\\\\n&& \\Delta^1 f[x_0, x_1] && \\\\\nx_1 & f(x_1) && \\Delta^2 f[x_0, x_1, x_2] & \\\\\n&& \\Delta^1 f[x_1, x_2] && \\Delta^3 [x_0, x_1, x_2. x_3] \\\\\nx_2 & f(x_2) && \\Delta^2 f[x_1, x_2, x_3] &  \\vdots & \\ddots \\\\\n&& \\Delta^1 f[x_2, x_3] & \\vdots & \\\\\nx_3 & f(x_3) & \\vdots && \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots &&&\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nThe arrangement of this table makes it easy to compute the divided\ndifferences. Also, once such a table has been computed, one can read off\nthe coefficients in the divided difference interpolation formula as the\ntop entries in the various columns.\n\nTo explain the computation, as well as to program it on a computer, it\nis convenient to label the locations in our table with pairs of integers\nlike so: $$\\begin{matrix}\n* & (0, 0) &&&& \\\\\n* &        & (0, 1) &&& \\\\\n* & (1, 1) &        & (0,2) && \\\\\n* &        & (1, 2) &       & (0, 3) & \\\\\n* & (2, 2) &        & (1,3) & \\vdots & \\ddots \\\\\n* &        & (2, 3) & \\vdots && \\\\\n* & (3, 3) & \\vdots &&& \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots &&&&\n\\end{matrix}$$ For convenience, introduce the notation $\\Delta_{ij}$ to\ndenote the entry of the difference table at location $(i, j)$. Then,\nbecause of the recursion\n$$\\Delta^{n+1} f [x_0, x_1,\\ldots, x_{n+1}] = {\\Delta^n f [x_1, x_2, \\ldots ,x_{n+1}] - \\Delta^n f [x_0, x_1 ,\\ldots, x_{n}] \\over x_{n+1} - x_0},$$\nwe have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta_{jj} &= f(x_j) \\\\\n\\Delta_{ij} &= {\\Delta_{i-1\\,j} - \\Delta_{i\\,j-1} \\over x_j - x_i}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nUsing these formulae, we may systematically compute the divided\ndifference table as follows: The first and second column are just the\ntabulation of our function, so we may write them down immediately. Then\nwe fill out the table one column at a time by using the formula.\n\nLet us illustrate with a simple example. Consider the following choices\nfor $f$ and $x_1$: $$\\begin{aligned}\nf(x) &= x^2 - 4 x + 1 \\\\\nx_0 &= 2 \\\\\nx_1 &= 3 \\\\\nx_2 &= 5 \\end{aligned}$$ We may write down our first two columns:\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -3 \\\\ \\\\\n3 & -2 \\\\ \\\\\n5 & 6\n\\end{matrix}$$ Now, we start filling in the next column, starting with\n$\\Delta_{0\\,1}$. We take the difference of $-2$ and $-3$ and divide it\nby $x_1 - x_0$. Since $${(-2) - (-3) \\over 3 - 2} = {1 \\over 1} = 1,$$\nwe have $$\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -3  &\\\\ \n  &     & 1\\\\\n3 & -2  & \\\\\n  &     & \\\\\n5 &  6  &\n\\end{matrix} \\qquad.$$ Next we fill in the entry $\\Delta_{1\\,2}$. We\ntake the difference of $6$ and $-2$ and divide it by $x_2 - x_1$. Since\n$${6 - (-2) \\over 5 - 3} = {8 \\over 2} = 4,$$ we have $$\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -3  &\\\\ \n  &     & 1 \\\\\n3 & -2  & \\\\\n  &     & 4 \\\\\n5 &  6  &\n\\end{matrix} \\qquad.$$ Finally, we fill in the entry $\\Delta_{0\\,2}$. We\ntake the difference of $4$ and $1$ and divide it by $x_2 - x_0$. Since\n$${4 - 1 \\over 5 - 2} = {3 \\over 3} = 1,$$ we have $$\\begin{matrix}\n2 & -3  &   & \\\\ \n  &     & 1 & \\\\\n3 & -2  &   & 1 \\\\\n  &     & 4 &\\\\\n5 &  6  &   &\n\\end{matrix} \\qquad.$$ Thus, we have constructed our difference table.\nThe top entries in the columns are $-3, 1, 1$ so, as per our earlier\nremark, the divided difference interpolation formula reads\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nf(x) &= -3 + (x - 2) + (x - 2) (x - 3) \\\\\n&= 1 - 4 x + x^2.\\end{aligned}$$ Since $f$ is a second order polynomial,\nthis interpolation to second order is exact. There is no remainder and,\nupon simplifying the expression, we recover our original polynomial.",
