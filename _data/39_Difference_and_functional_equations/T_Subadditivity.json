  "definition": "A sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is called *subadditive* if it\nsatisfies the inequality $$\\label{eqn:seq}\na_{n+m}\\leq a_n+a_m\\qquad\\text{for all $n$ and $m$}.$$ The major reason\nfor use of subadditive sequences is the following lemma due to Fekete.\n\nFor every subadditive sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ the limit\n$\\lim a_n/n$ exists and is equal to $\\inf a_n/n$.\n\nSimilarly, a function $f(x)$ is *subadditive* if\n$$f(x+y)\\leq f(x)+f(y)\\qquad\\text{for all $x$ and $y$}.$$ The analogue\nof Fekete lemma holds for subadditive functions as well.\n\nThere are extensions of Fekete lemma that do not require to hold for all\n$m$ and $n$. There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of\nconvergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete lemma if\nsome kind of both and subadditivity is present.
