  "definition": "A sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is called *superadditive* if it\nsatisfies the inequality $$\\label{eqn:seq}\na_{n+m}\\geq a_n+a_m\\qquad\\text{for all $n$ and $m$}.$$ The major reason\nfor use of superadditive sequences is the following lemma due to Fekete.\n\nFor every superadditive sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ the limit\n$\\lim a_n/n$ exists and is equal to $\\sup a_n/n$.\n\nSimilarly, a function $f(x)$ is *superadditive* if\n$$f(x+y)\\geq f(x)+f(y)\\qquad\\text{for all $x$ and $y$}.$$ The analogue\nof Fekete lemma holds for superadditive functions as well.\n\nThere are extensions of Fekete lemma that do not require to hold for all\n$m$ and $n$. There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of\nconvergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete lemma if\nsome kind of both super- and subadditivity is present.
