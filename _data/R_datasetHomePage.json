PlanetMath's content is created collaboratively: the main feature is the mathematics encyclopedia with entries written and reviewed by members.\n\nAlthough PlanetMath is not seeing any new content now, it has accumulated a wealth of semi-structured knowledge with the help of its community of about 24,000 people with various maths interests. With an emphasis on rigor, openness, pedagogy, real-time and interlinked content, PlanetMath has accumulated over 9000 entries containing information on a wide range of Mathematics topics. \n\nWe, at Sophize, are bringing this high-quality knowledge store into our platform. Structured knowledge extracted from the entries is being used to create a network of information that spans across encyclopedias, research papers, formal systems are more. This network will aid our users in various situations such as 1) looking-up Mathematical concepts while reading a research article, 3) finding existing and developing new proofs 3) referencing a definition/theorem while engaging in a discussion.\n\nThe following is a small sample from over 4000 definitions that we have extracted from PlanetMath:\n> - #T_LevelSet\n> - #T_Groupoid\n> - #T_HodgeTheory\n> - #T_TangentOfCircle\n> - #T_SymmetricAlgebra\n> - #T_FermatNumbers\n\nWe have also extracted hundreds of theorems - many along with their proofs\n> - #P_HilbertBasisTheorem\n> - #P_BohrMollerupTheorem\n> - #P_WilsonsTheorem\n> - #P_PythagoreanTheorem\n> - #P_RiemannsRemovableSingularityTheorem\n> - #P_CatalansIdentity\n> - #P_AdosTheorem\n> - #P_HerbrandsTheoremfirstOrderLogic\n\nAlthough we have been able to incorporate over 70% PlanetMath entries so far, we are continuing to extract more data, fixing formatting issues, and generating interlinks between the entries.\n\n## Subject index\n\n#R_mathematical_logic_and_foundations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_mechanics_of_particles_and_systems|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_statistical_mechanics_structure_of_matter|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_algebraic_geometry|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_commutative_rings_and_algebras|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_geophysics|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_quantum_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_order_lattices_ordered_algebraic_structures|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_biology_and_other_natural_sciences|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_optics_electromagnetic_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_systems_theory_control|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_category_theory_homological_algebra|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_field_theory_and_polynomials|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_information_and_communication_circuits|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_nonassociative_rings_and_algebras|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_manifolds_and_cell_complexes|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_integral_transforms_operational_calculus|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_numerical_analysis|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_number_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_special_functions|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_history_and_biography|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_integral_equations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_topological_groups_lie_groups|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_differential_geometry|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_combinatorics|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_approximations_and_expansions|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_statistics|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_probability_theory_and_stochastic_processes|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_difference_and_functional_equations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_functions_of_a_complex_variable|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_mathematics_education|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_operations_research_mathematical_programming|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_algebraic_topology|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_potential_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_general_topology|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_relativity_and_gravitational_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_convex_and_discrete_geometry|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_general|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_partial_differential_equations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_associative_rings_and_algebras|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_real_functions|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_game_theory_economics_social_and_behavioral_sciences|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_operator_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_dynamical_systems_and_ergodic_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_general_algebraic_systems|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_geometry|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_k-theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_sequences_series_summability|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_computer_science|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_ordinary_differential_equations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_several_complex_variables_and_analytic_spaces|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_group_theory_and_generalizations|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_fourier_analysis|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_linear_and_multilinear_algebra_matrix_theory|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_calculus_of_variations_and_optimal_control_optimization|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_global_analysis_analysis_on_manifolds|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_functional_analysis|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_measure_and_integration|NAV_LINK\n\n#R_abstract_harmonic_analysis|NAV_LINK\n"
