  "definition": "In classical propositional logic, an *interpretation* of a well-formed\nformula (wff) $p$ is an assignment of truth (=1) or falsity (=0) to $p$.\nAny interpreted wff is called a proposition.\n\nAn *interpretation* of all wffs over the variable set $V$ is then a\nBoolean function on $\\overline{V}$. However, one needs to be careful,\nfor we do not want both $p$ and $\\neg p$ be interpreted as true\nsimultaneously (at least not in classical propositional logic)! The\nproper way to find an interpretation on the wffs is to start from the\natoms.\n\nCall any Boolean-valued function $\\nu$ on $V$ a *valuation* on $V$. We\nwant to extend $\\nu$ to a Boolean-valued function $\\overline{\\nu}$ on\n$\\overline{V}$ of all wffs. The way this is done is similar to the\nconstruction of wffs; we build a sequence of functions, starting from\n$\\nu$ on $V_0$, next $\\nu_1$ on $V_1$, and so on... Finally, we take the\nunion of all these \u201capproximations\u201d to arrive at $\\overline{\\nu}$. So\nhow do we go from $\\nu$ to $\\nu_1$? We need to interpret $\\neg p$ and\n$p\\vee q$ from the valuations of atoms $p$ and $q$. In other words, we\nmust also interpret logical connectives too.\n\nBefore doing this, we define a truth function for each of the logical\nconnectives:\n\n-   for $\\neg$, define $f:\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace \\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$\n    given by $f(x)=1-x$.\n\n-   for $\\vee$, define $g:\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace^2 \\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$\n    given by $g(x,y)=\\max(x,y)$.\n\nAs we are trying to *interpret* $\\neg$ (not) and $\\vee$ (or), the\nchoices for $f$ and $g$ are clear. The values $0,1$ are interpreted as\nthe usual integers (so they can be subtracted and ordered, etc...).\nHence $f$ and $g$ make sense.\n\nNext, recall that $V_i$ are sets of wffs built up from wffs in $V_{i-1}$\n(see construction of well-formed formulas for more detail). We define a\nfunction $\\nu_i: V_i\\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ for each $i$, as follows:\n\n-   $\\nu_0:=\\nu$\n\n-   suppose $\\nu_i$ has been defined, we define\n    $\\nu_{i+1}:V_{i+1} \\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ given by\n    $$\\nu_{i+1}(p):= \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\nu_i(p) & \\mbox{if } p\\in V_i,\\\\\n    f(\\nu_i(q)) & \\mbox{if } p = \\neg q\\mbox{ for some }q\\in V_i, \\\\\n    g(\\nu_i(q),\\nu_i(r)) & \\mbox{if } p = q\\vee r \\mbox{ for some }q,r\\in V_i.\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$\n\nFinally, take $\\overline{\\nu}$ to be the union of all the\napproximations: $$\\overline{\\nu}:=\\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\nu_i.$$ Then,\nby unique readability of wffs, $\\overline{\\nu}$ is an interpretation on\n$\\overline{V}$.\n\n**Remark**. If $\\perp$ is included in the language of the logic (as the\nsymbol for falsity), we also require that\n$\\nu_i(\\perp)=\\overline{\\nu}(\\perp)=0$.\n\n**Remark** $\\overline{V}$ can be viewed as an inductive set over $V$\nwith respect to the $\\neg$ and $\\vee$, viewed as operations on\n$\\overline{V}$. Furthermore, $\\overline{V}$ is freely generated by $V$,\nsince each $V_{i+1}$ can be partitioned into sets $V_i$,\n$\\lbrace (p \\vee q) \\mid p,q \\in V_i\\rbrace$, and\n$\\lbrace (\\neg p) \\mid p\\in V_i\\rbrace$, and each partition is\nnon-empty. As a result, any valuation $\\nu$ on $V$ uniquely extends to a\nvaluation $\\overline{\\nu}$ on $\\overline{V}$.\n\n**Definitions**. Let $p,q$ be wffs in $\\overline{V}$.\n\n-   $p$ is *true* or *satisfiable* for some valuation $\\nu$ if\n    $\\overline{\\nu}(p)=1$ (otherwise, it is *false* for $\\nu$).\n\n-   $p$ is true for every valuation $\\nu$, then $p$ is said to be\n    *valid* (or *tautologous*). If $p$ is false for every $\\nu$, it is\n    *invalid*. If $p$ is valid, we write $\\models p$.\n\n-   $p$ implies $q$ for a valuation $\\nu$ if $\\overline{\\nu}(p)=1$\n    implies $\\overline{\\nu}(q)=1$. $p$ *semantically implies* if $p$\n    implies $q$ for every valuation $\\nu$, and is denoted by\n    $p \\models q$.\n\n-   $p$ is *equivalent* to $q$ for $\\nu$ if\n    $\\overline{\\nu}(p)=\\overline{\\nu}(q)$. They are *semantically\n    equivalent* if they are equivalent for every $\\nu$, and written\n    $p\\equiv q$.\n\nSemantical equivalence is an equivalence relation on $\\overline{V}$.\n\nThe above can be easily generalized to sets of wffs. Let $T$ be a set of\npropositions.\n\n-   $T$ is true or satisfiable for $\\nu$ if\n    $\\overline{\\nu}(T)=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ (otherwise, it is false for\n    $\\nu$).\n\n-   $T$ is valid if it is true for every $\\nu$; it is *invalid* if it is\n    false for every $\\nu$. If $T$ is valid, we write $\\models T$.\n\n-   $T$ implies $p$ for $\\nu$ if $\\overline{\\nu}(T)=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$\n    implies $\\overline{\\nu}(p)=1$. $T$ semantically implies $p$ if $T$\n    implies $p$ for every $\\nu$, and is denoted by $T\\models p$.\n\n-   $T_1$ implies $T_2$ for $\\nu$ if, for every $p\\in T_2$, $T_1$\n    implies $p$ for $\\nu$. $T_1$ semantically implies $T_2$ if $T_1$\n    implies $T_2$ for every $\\nu$, and is denoted by $T_1 \\models T_2$.\n\n-   $T_1$ is equivalent to $T_2$ for $\\nu$ if for some valuation $\\nu$,\n    $T_1$ implies $T_2$ for $\\nu$ and $T_2$ implies $T_1$ for $\\nu$.\n    $T_1$ and $T_2$ are semantically equivalent if $T_1 \\models T_2$ and\n    $T_2 \\models T_1$, written $T_1 \\equiv T_2$.\n\nClearly, $\\models p$ iff $\\varnothing \\models p$, and $T\\models p$ iff\n$T\\models \\lbrace p\\rbrace$.",
