  "definition": "Background, definitions and notation\n====================================\n\nIn a first order theory with equality, whose domain is for example the\nset of positive integers, an object of the domain can be represented by\na name, like \u201c2\u201d, or by a complex expression, like \u201cthe positive square\nroot of 4\u201d, in which case the number 2 is not even explicitly used.\n\nThe interesting difference between the two representations consists in\nthe fact that the complex expression makes it possible to refer to an\nobject with a certain property, even in the absence of the object\u2019s\nname.\n\nThe first systematic study of this fundamental logical process was done\nby Bertrand Russell in *Principia Mathematica* and in *Introduction to\nmathematical philosophy*, where Russell proposed to call descriptions\nall expressions of the general form\n\n\u201cthe object $x$ such that $F (x)$\u201d.\n\nIn *Introduction to mathematical philosophy* Russell makes a distinction\nbetween definite and indefinite descriptions. These have the general\nform\n\n\u201can object $x$ such that $F (x)$\u201d.\n\nThis distinction did not find much echo in his subsequent logical\ntheory, where the main focus became rather the development of a theory\nof definite descriptions.\n\nThus where a name is an arbitrary symbol assigned to an object of the\ndomain, and one then says that the object is the denotation of the name,\nin contrast a description is a condition which applies to any object of\nthe domain that satisfies it. In a definite description the object is\ncharacterized by the fact that a certain predicate is uniquely satisfied\nby the object.\n\nThe condition that a certain predicate $F (a)$ is satisfied by a unique\nobject $a$ is represented in the so called *uniqueness formulas* for\n$F (a)$ with the following configuration:\n\n$$(\\exists x) F (x)$$\n\n$$(\\forall x) (\\forall y) {[F (x) \\wedge F (y)] \\to (x = y)}.$$\n\nThe extension of the predicate $F (a)$ determines the object that\nuniquely satisfies $F$ and for that reason the argument of the predicate\nplays the role of a bound variable.\n\nIn *Principia Mathematica* the notation introduced for the definite\ndescription is a functional variable, known as the *description\noperator*. It is build by the small Greek letter $\\iota$ with $x$ as an\nindex, followed by the predicate to which the operator is applied:\n\n$\\iota_{x} F (x).$\n\nIt is to such an expression that Russell calls a description.\n\nSyntax\n======\n\nIn relation to syntax it is to be noticed that a description may have an\noccurrence in an argument position. This then gives rise to a formula\nlike\n\n$$B [\\iota_{x} F (x)]$$\n\nthe interpretation of which is the statement\n\n\u201cthere is a unique object which satisfies $F (a)$ and also satisfies\n$B (a)$\u201d.\n\nIf the conditions stipulated by the uniqueness formulas are not\nsatisfied, in propositions like for example \u201cthe smallest complex number\nis prime\u201d, the description \u201cthe smallest complex number\u201d is said to be\nempty and the proposition in which it occurs is false.\n\nNotice that the interpretation of the formula\n\n$$B [\\iota_{x} F (x)]$$\n\nis *not* an explicit definition of the description\n\n$$\\iota_{x} F (x),$$\n\nsince for this symbol we do not have a defining expression. What we have\nis a semantic characterization of the formulas in which the description\noccurs as one of its constituent parts, as a term.\n\nIf there is a derivation of the uniqueness formulas for $F (a)$ then the\nsymbol\n\n$$\\iota_{x} F (x)$$\n\nis a term, in particular the term representing the unique object that\nsatisfies $F (a)$.\n\nThe $\\iota$-operator is subject to the so called $\\iota$-Rule with the\nfollowing content:\n\n> *If the uniqueness formulas for $F (a)$ have been derived then the\n> description $\\iota_{x} F (x)$ is a term and the formula*\n>\n> $$F [\\iota_x F (x)]$$\n>\n> *can now be derived by means of the following scheme:*\n>\n> $(\\exists x) F (x)$\n>\n> $(\\forall x) (\\forall y) {[F (x) \\wedge F (y)] \\to (x = y)}$\n>\n> $\\line(1,0){170}$\n>\n> $\\therefore F [\\iota_{x} F (x)]$\n\nThe rule of the redenomination of bound variables for quantifiers can be\napplied to the bound variable of the $\\iota$-operator. Likewise the\ncollision of bound variables, that one has to prevent when using\nquantifiers, has also to be prevented also with the use of the\n$\\iota$-operator.\n\nHilbert\u2019s epsilon-axiom\n=======================\n\nOn the face of it it would seem that the introduction of $\\iota$-terms\nand of the $\\iota$-Rule would allow the derivation of new formulas. But\none can prove that if a formula $A$ of the first order predicate\ncalculus with equality, with 0-occurences of $\\iota$-terms, is derivable\nby means of the $\\iota$-operator and the $\\iota$-Rule, then $A$ can also\nbe derived without the use of the $\\iota$-operator.\n\nOther than the *formal* eliminability of the $\\iota$-operator, Hilbert\nalso adopted the introduction of a symbol which secures the\neliminability of the $\\iota$-operator.\n\nThe basic idea is the following:\n\n> *the descriptive term*\n>\n> $$\\iota_{x} A (x)$$\n>\n> *formally represents the statement*\n>\n> \u201c**the object $x$ which has the property $A$**\u201d.\n\nAs we have seen above this term can only be formally introduced after\nthe derivation of the uniqueness formulas.\n\nHilbert proves that these formulas can be dispensed with and the\n$\\iota$-operator be replaced by his $\\varepsilon$-operator.\n\nThe introduction of this operator is to be controlled by conditions that\nspecify:\n\n1.  Which are the well formed formulas in which the operator is going to\n    occur;\n\n2.  How the underlying logic is going to be adjusted;\n\n3.  They give an axiom that defines the use of $\\varepsilon$.\n\nIn particular, let us assume that $A (x)$ is a formula in which $x$ has\na free occurrence. We can then build a term of the form\n\n$$\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)$$\n\nwhere the occurrence of $x$ is now bound.\n\nIf a term built with the $\\iota$-operator can be interpreted as a\ndefinite description, the term built with $\\varepsilon$ can be\ninterpreted as an indefinite description.\n\nSo if there is at least a value $k$ such that $A (k)$ is satisfied, then\nthe term\n\n$$\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)$$\n\ndenotes *an object, without further specifications*, which satisfies\n$A$. If there is no such $k$ such that\n\n$$\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)$$\n\nthen we let the term denote an arbitrary value. This already implies\nthat the formula\n\n$$(\\exists x) A (x) \\to A [\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)]$$\n\nis true.\n\nThe fundamental axiom is the following:\n\n**Axiom $\\varepsilon$: If $F$ is a predicate with a free occurrence of\n$y$, then**\n\n($\\star$) $F (y) \\to F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)]$.\n\nThe axiom of choice\n===================\n\nIt was already pointed out that the variable $x$ of the\n$\\varepsilon$-term is a bound variable and that the redenomination rule\nfor bound variables can be applied.\n\nThe formula $A (x)$ to which the $\\varepsilon$-operator is attached as a\nprefix may contain variables, free or bound by $\\forall$, $\\exists$,\n$\\iota$ or $\\varepsilon$. In that case the formal definition of the\n$\\varepsilon$-term can not give rise to the *collision of bound\nvariables*.\n\nFor Hilbert\u2019s new symbol the name \u201c**choice operator**\u201d has been\nsuggested, due to the obvious analogy between the $\\varepsilon$-axiom\nand the axiom of choice.\n\nTo develop the analogy, let us suppose that\n\n$$\\{M_{i}\\}$$\n\ndenotes a set of disjoint non-empty sets $M_{i}$ (with $i \\in I$). Now\nthe axiom of choice secures the existence of a function which chooses\nfrom each set $M_{i}$ an element $m_{i} \\in M_{i}$, the representative\nelement of $M_{i}$.\n\nHilbert\u2019s $\\varepsilon$-operator works like such a function, since the\nterm\n\n$$\\varepsilon_{x} (x \\in M_{i})$$\n\nin the usual interpretation represents a chosen element $m_{i}$ from\n$M_{i}$.\n\nThus if we have the following:\n\n1.  $A (a, \\ldots, k, x)$\n\n    is a formula in which $a, \\ldots, k, x$ are the only free variables,\n    and\n\n2.  A relation which maps every set of elements $a, \\ldots, k$ to at\n    least an element $m$ such that\n\n    $$A (a,\\ldots, k, m),$$\n\n    then\n\n    $$\\varepsilon_{x} A (a,\\ldots, k, x)$$\n\n    is a function which maps every set of values of the arguments\n    $a,\\ldots, k$ to a unique value $x$.\n\nTo sober up the analogy a little, it is to be noticed that Hilbert\nintended the choice function to have a finitistic meaning and\naccordingly to perform only a finite number of choices of one element at\na time. In contrast the real choice function of the axiom of choice\nperforms an infinite number of simultaneous choices.\n\nThe elimination of descriptions and quantifiers\n===============================================\n\nWe sketch now some of the best known properties of the\n$\\varepsilon$-operator.\n\n1.  **Descriptions**\n\n    If for a formula $A (x)$ it is at all possible to introduce the\n\n    $\\iota$-operator\n\n    then\n\n    $$\\iota_{x} A (x) = \\varepsilon_{x} A (x).$$\n\n    The argument is the following:\n\n    -   **i)** If the $\\iota$-operator can be introduced then one has\n        the term $$A [\\iota_{x} A (x)].$$\n\n    -   **ii)** In the formula ($\\star$), Hilbert\u2019s axiom, we insert $A$\n        for $F$ and the descriptive term $\\iota_{x} A (x)$ for $y$ and\n        we obtain the formula\n\n        $$A [\\iota_{x} A (x)] \\to A [\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)].$$\n\n    -   **iii)** By i) and *modus ponens* one has then\n\n        $$A [\\varepsilon_{x} A (x)].$$\n\n    -   **iv)** This shows that if the descriptive term can be\n        introduced then the $\\varepsilon$-term satisfies the same\n        predicate $A$ and therefore that\n\n        $$\\iota_{x} A (x) = \\varepsilon_{x} A (x).$$\n\n2.  **Quantifiers**\n\n    -   **i) Existence**\n\n        If we start with the $\\varepsilon$-axiom\n\n        $$F (y) \\to F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)]$$\n\n        then by $\\exists$-introduction we obtain\n\n        $$(\\exists x) F (x) \\to F [\\varepsilon_x F (x)].$$\n\n        Existential Generalization gives the formula\n\n        $$F (y) \\to (\\exists x) F (x)$$\n\n        and by inserting the $\\varepsilon$-term for $y$ we get\n\n        $$F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)] \\to (\\exists x) F (x).$$\n\n        This shows that\n\n        $$(\\exists x) F (x) \\leftrightarrow F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)].$$\n\n    -   **ii) Generality**\n\n        We use as starting formula\n\n        $$(\\exists x) F (x) \\leftrightarrow F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)].$$\n\n        The rule of insertion allows the reformulation\n\n        $$(\\exists x) \\sim F (x) \\leftrightarrow \\sim F [\\varepsilon_{x} \\sim F (x)].$$\n\n        The propositional tautology\n\n        $$(X \\leftrightarrow Y) \\to (\\sim X \\leftrightarrow \\sim Y)$$\n\n        gives the formula\n\n        $$\\sim (\\exists x) \\sim F (x) \\leftrightarrow \\sim \\sim F [\\varepsilon_{x} \\sim F (x)].$$\n\n        From predicate calculus we get\n\n        $$(\\forall x) F (x) \\leftrightarrow \\sim \\sim F [\\varepsilon_{x} \\sim F (x)].$$\n\n    -   **iii) *Dictum de Omni***\n\n        The same kind of argument allows the derivation of *dictum de\n        omni*.\n\n        To prove\n\n        $$(\\forall x) F (x) \\to F (y)$$\n\n        we start with the $\\varepsilon$-axiom\n\n        $$F (y) \\to F [\\varepsilon_{x} F (x)]$$\n\n        and by the rule of insertion we get\n\n        $$\\sim F (y) \\to \\sim F [\\varepsilon_{x} \\sim F (x)].$$\n\n        The propositional tautology\n\n        $$(X \\to Y) \\leftrightarrow (\\sim Y \\to \\sim X)$$\n\n        gives the formula\n\n        $$\\sim \\sim F [\\varepsilon_{x} \\sim F (x)] \\to \\sim \\sim F (y).$$\n\n        But by Part ii) above this is\n\n        $$(\\forall x) F (x) \\to \\sim \\sim F (y).$$\n\n        Double negation gives\n\n        $$(\\forall x) F (x) \\to F (y)$$\n\n        as desired.\n\n[90]{} Fraenkel, A., *Foundations of set theory*, North-Holland,\nAmsterdam, 1958.
