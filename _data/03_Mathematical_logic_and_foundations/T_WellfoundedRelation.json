  "definition": "A binary relation $R$ on a $X$ is *well-founded* if and only if\n\n-   each nonempty subclass of $X$ contains an $R$-minimal element and,\n\n-   for each $x \\in X$, $\\lbrace y \\mid y\\,R\\,x \\rbrace$ is a set.\n\nThe notion of a well-founded relation is a generalization of that of a\nwell-ordering relation: proof by induction and definition by recursion\nmay be carried out over well-founded relations.",
