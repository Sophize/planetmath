  "definition": "Synonym of mapping and function. Often used to refer to mappings where\nthe domain and codomain are, in some sense a space of functions.\n\nExamples: differential operator, convolution operator.\n\nIn the study of algebraic systems such as groups and rings, an operator\noften refers to a mapping from some cartesian power $A^{\\lambda}$ of a\nset $A$ to the set $A$, where $\\lambda$ is a cardinal. For example,\nmultiplication of integers can be thought of as an operator from\n$\\mathbb{Z}^2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$.",
