  "definition": "A remedy for Berry\u2019s Paradox and related paradoxes is to separate the\nlanguage used to formulate a particular mathematical theory from the\nlanguage used for its discourse.\n\nThe language used to formulate a mathematical theory is called the\n*object language* to contrast it from the *metalanguage* used for the\ndiscourse.\n\nThe most widely used object language is the first-order logic. The\nmetalanguage could be English or other natural languages plus\nmathematical symbols such as $\\Rightarrow$.\\\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Examples</span>\n\n1.  The object language speaks of $(\\neg A_n)$, but we speak of\n    $\\langle (, \\neg, A_n, ) \\rangle$ in the metalanguage. \\[Recall that\n    a formula is some finite sequence of the symbols. Cf. First Order\n    Logic or Propositional Logic.\\]\n\n2.  In induction proofs, one might encounter \u201cthe first symbol in the\n    formula $\\varphi$ is $($;\u201d we know that the first symbol is indeed\n    $($ and not $\\langle$ because $\\langle$ is a symbol in our\n    metalanguage. Similarly, \u201cthe third symbol is $A_n$\u201d and not $,$\n    because $,$ is a symbol in our metalanguage.\n\n3.  $\\vdash$ and $\\models$ are members of the metalanguage, *not* of\n    object language.\n\n4.  Parallel with the notion of metalanguage is metatheorem.\n    \u201c$\\Gamma\\vdash(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi)$ if\n    $\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}\\vdash\\psi, \\Gamma\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_0,\n        \\varphi, \\psi\\in\\mathcal{L}_0$\" is a metatheorem.\n\n5.  *Examples from Set Theory*. Let \u201cCon\" denote consistency. Then\n    Con(ZF) and Con(ZF+AC+GCH) are metamathematical statements; they are\n    statements in the metalanguage.\n\n[1]{} Schechter, E., *Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations*, 1st\ned., Academic Press, 1997.",
