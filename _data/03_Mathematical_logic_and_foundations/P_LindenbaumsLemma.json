  "statement": "In this entry, we prove the following assertion known as Lindenbaum\u2019s\nlemma: every consistent set is a subset of a maximally consistent set.\nFrom this, we automatically conclude the existence of a maximally\nconsistent set based on the fact that the empty set is consistent\n(vacuously).\n\n(Lindenbaum\u2019s lemma) Every consistent set can be extended to a maximally\nconsistent set.\n\nWe give two proofs of this, one uses Zorn\u2019s lemma, and the other does\nnot, and is based on the countability of the set of wff\u2019s in the logic.\nBoth proofs require the following:\n\nThe union of a chain of consistent sets, ordered by $\\subseteq$, is\nconsistent.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}:=\\lbrace \\Gamma_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a chain of\nconsistent sets ordered by $\\subseteq$ and indexed by some set $I$. We\nwant to show that $\\Gamma:=\\bigcup \\mathcal{C}$ is also consistent.\nSuppose not. Then $\\Gamma \\vdash \\perp$. Let $A_1,\\ldots, A_n$ be a\ndeduction of $\\perp$ (which is $A_n$) from $\\Gamma$. Then for each\n$j=1,\\ldots,n-1$, there is some $\\Gamma_{i(j)} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such\nthat $\\Gamma_{i(j)} \\vdash A_i$. Since $\\mathcal{C}$ is a chain, take\nthe largest of the $\\Gamma_{i(j)}$\u2019s, say $\\Gamma_k$, so that\n$\\Gamma_k \\vdash A_i$ for all $i=1,\\ldots,n-1$. This implies that\n$\\Gamma_k \\vdash A_n$, or $\\Gamma_k \\vdash \\perp$, contradicting the\nassumption that $\\Gamma_k$ is consistent. As a result, $\\Gamma$ is\nconsistent.\n\n*First Proof*. Suppose $\\Delta$ is consistent. Let $P$ be the partially\nordered set of all consistent supersets of $\\Delta$, ordered by\ninclusion $\\subseteq$. If $\\mathcal{C}$ is a chain of elements in $P$,\nthen $\\bigcup \\mathcal{C}$ is consistent by the lemma above, so\n$\\bigcup \\mathcal{C} \\in P$ as each element of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a\nsuperset of $\\Delta$. By Zorn\u2019s lemma, $P$ has a maximal element, call\nit $\\Gamma$. To see that $\\Gamma$ is maximally consistent, suppose\n$\\Gamma$ is not maximal. Then there is a wff $A$ such that\n$\\Gamma \\not\\vdash A$ and $\\Gamma \\not\\vdash \\neg A$, the first of which\nimplies that $A\\notin \\Gamma$, and the second of which implies that\n$\\Gamma\\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$ is consistent, and therefore in $P$. The\ntwo imply that $\\Gamma\\cup\\lbrace A\\rbrace$ is a consistent proper\nsuperset of $\\Gamma$, contradicting the maximality of $\\Gamma$ in $P$.\nTherefore, $\\Gamma$ is maximally consistent. $\\square$\n\n*Second Proof*. Let $A_1,\\ldots, A_n, \\ldots$ be an enumeration of all\nwff\u2019s of the logic in question (this can be achieved if the set of\npropositional variables can be enumerated). Let $\\Delta$ be a consistent\nset of wff\u2019s. Define sets $\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2, \\ldots, \\Gamma$ of wff\u2019s\ninductively as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Gamma_1 &:=& \\Delta \\\\\n\\Gamma_{n+1} &:=&\n\\begin{cases}\n\\Gamma_n \\cup \\lbrace A_n \\rbrace & \\textrm{if }\\Gamma_n \\vdash A_n \\\\\n\\Gamma_n \\cup \\lbrace \\neg A_n \\rbrace & \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\Gamma &:=& \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\Gamma_i.\\end{aligned}$$ First,\nnotice that each $\\Gamma_i$ is consistent. This is done by induction on\n$i$. By assumption, the case is true when $i=1$. Now, suppose $\\Gamma_n$\nis consistent. Then its deductive closure Ded$(\\Gamma_n)$ is also\nconsistent. If $\\Gamma_n \\vdash A_n$, then clearly\n$\\Gamma_n \\cup \\lbrace A_n \\rbrace$ is consistent since it is a subset\nof Ded$(\\Gamma)$. Otherwise, $\\Gamma_n \\not\\vdash A_n$, or\n$\\Gamma_n \\not\\vdash \\neg \\neg A_n$ by the substitution theorem, and\ntherefore $\\Gamma_n \\cup \\lbrace \\neg A_n \\rbrace$ by one of the\nproperties of consistency (see ). In either case, $\\Gamma_{n+1}$ is\nconsistent.\n\nNext, $\\Gamma$ is maximally consistent. $\\Gamma$ is consistent because,\nby the lemma above, it is the union of a chain of consistent sets. To\nsee that $\\Gamma$ is maximal, pick any wff $A$. Then $A$ is some $A_n$\nin the enumerated list of all wff\u2019s. Therefore, either\n$A\\in \\Gamma_{n+1}$ or $\\neg A\\in \\Gamma_{n+1}$. Since\n$\\Gamma_{n+1}\\subseteq \\Gamma$, we have $A\\in \\Gamma$ or\n$\\neg A\\in \\Gamma$, which implies that $\\Gamma$ is maximal (see ).\n$\\square$.\n\nGiven a logic $L$, let $W_L$ be the set of all maximally $L$-consistent\nsets. By Lindebaum\u2019s lemma, $W_L\\ne \\varnothing$. We record two useful\ncorollaries:\n\n-   For any consistent set $\\Delta$,\n    Ded$(\\Delta)= \\bigcap \\lbrace \\Gamma \\in W_L \\mid \\Delta \\subseteq \\Gamma \\rbrace$.\n\n-   $L=\\bigcap W_L$.\n\nThe second statement is a corollary of the first, for\n$L= \\mbox{Ded}(\\varnothing)$. To see the first, let\n$\\mathcal{D}:= \\lbrace \\Gamma \\in W_L \\mid \\Delta \\subseteq \\Gamma \\rbrace$.\nThen $\\mathcal{D} \\ne \\varnothing$ by Lindebaum\u2019s lemma. Also, for any\n$\\Gamma \\in \\mathcal{D}$, Ded$(\\Delta) \\subseteq \\Gamma$ since $\\Gamma$\nis deductively closed. On the other hand if\n$A \\notin \\mbox{Ded}(\\Delta)$, then $\\Delta\\not\\vdash A$, so\n$\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace \\neg A\\rbrace$ is consistent, and therefore is\ncontained in a maximally consistent set $\\Gamma' \\in \\mathcal{D}$ by\nLindenbaum\u2019s lemma. Since $\\neg A \\in \\Gamma'$, $A\\notin \\Gamma'$, so\nthat $A\\notin \\bigcap \\mathcal{D}$.",
