  "definition": "According to the dictionary **Webster\u2019s 1913**, which can be accessed\nthrough , mathematical meaning of the word *operation* is: \u201c*some\n**transformation** to be made upon quantities*\u201d. Thus, operation is\nsimilar to mapping or function. The most general mathematical definition\nof operation can be made as follows:\n\n**Operation** $\\#$ defined on the sets $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$ with values\nin $X$ is a mapping from Cartesian product $X_1\\times X_2\\times\n\\cdots\\times X_n$ to $X$, i.e.\n$$\\# \\colon X_1\\times X_2\\times\\cdots\\times X_n \\longrightarrow X.$$\n\nResult of operation is usually denoted by one of the following notation:\n\n-   $x_1 \\# x_2 \\# \\cdots \\# x_n$\n\n-   $\\#(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$\n\n-   $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)_\\#$\n\nThe following examples show variety of the concept operation used in\nmathematics.\n\n1.  *Arithmetic operations*: , subtraction, , division. Their\n    generalization leads to the so-called binary operations, which is a\n    basic concept for such algebraic structures as groups and rings.\n\n2.  Operations on vectors in the plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$).\n\n    -   *Multiplication by a scalar*. Generalization leads to vector\n        spaces.\n\n    -   *Scalar product*. Generalization leads to Hilbert spaces.\n\n3.  Operations on vectors in the space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$).\n\n    -   *Cross product*. Can be generalized for the vector space of\n        arbitrary finite dimension, see vector product in general vector\n        spaces.\n\n    -   *Triple product*.\n\n4.  Some operations on functions.\n\n    -   *Composition*.\n\n    -   *Function inverse*.\n\nIn the case when some of the sets $X_i$ are equal to the values set $X$,\nit is usually said that operation is defined just on $X$. For such\noperations, it could be interesting to consider their action on some\nsubset $U\\subset X$. In particular, if operation on elements from $U$\nalways gives an element from $U$, it is said that $U$ is *closed under*\nthis operation. Formally it is expressed in the following definition.\n\nLet operation\n$\\#\\colon X_1\\times X_2\\times\\cdots\\times X_n \\longrightarrow X$ is\ndefined on $X$, i.e. there exists $k\\geq 1$ and indexes\n$1\\leq j_1 < j_2 < \\cdots < j_k\\leq n$ such that\n$X_{j_1}=X_{j_2}=\\cdots=X_{j_k}=X$. For simplicity, let us assume that\n$j_i=i$. A subset $U\\subset X$ is said to be **closed under** operation\n$\\#$ if for all $u_1,u_2,\\ldots,u_k$ from U and for all\n$x_j\\in X_j\\, j>k$ holds:\n$$\\#(u_1,u_2,\\ldots,u_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\\ldots,x_n)\\in U.$$\n\nThe next examples illustrates this definition.\n\n1.  Vector space $V$ over a field $K$ is a set, on which the following\n    two operations are defined:\n\n    -   multiplication by a scalar:\n        $$\\cdot\\colon K\\times V\\longrightarrow V$$\n\n    -   addition $$+\\colon V\\times V \\longrightarrow V.$$\n\n    Of course these operations need to satisfy some properties (for\n    details see the entry vector space). A subset $W\\subset V$, which is\n    closed under these operations, is called vector subspace.\n\n2.  Consider collection of all subsets of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$,\n    which we denote by $2^\\mathbb{R}$. On this collection, binary\n    operation intersection of sets is defined:\n    $$\\cap\\colon 2^\\mathbb{R} \\times 2^\\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow 2^\\mathbb{R}.$$\n    Collection of sets $\\mathfrak{C}\\subset 2^\\mathbb{R}$:\n    $$\\mathfrak{C}:=\\{ [a,b) \\colon \\, a\\leq b \\}$$ is closed under this\n    operation.",
