  "definition": "Let $K$ be a class of models (structures) of a given signature. Consider\na (non-empty) family of structures $ \\{ A_{i}:i \\in I \\} $ in $K$. If\n$j \\in I$ and $f : A_{j} \\rightarrow \\prod_{i \\in I}A_{i}$ is an\nembedding, we say that $f$ is a *factor embedding*. [@VC; @UM] If\nadditionally $f$ satisfies the condition that $\\pi_{j}\\circ f$ is the\nidentity on $A_{i}$, where\n$\\pi_{j} : \\prod_{i \\in I}A_{i} \\rightarrow A_{j}$ is the $j$th\nprojection, then $f$ is said to be a *strong factor embedding*. [@UM]\n$K$ is said to be a *factor embeddable* class iff for every (non-empty)\nfamily of structures $ \\{ A_{i}:i \\in I \\} $ in $K$ and every $j \\in I$\nthere is a factor embedding\n$f : A_{j} \\rightarrow \\prod_{i \\in I}A_{i}$. [@VC; @UM]\n\nThe definition above does not require the product $\\prod_{i \\in I}A_{i}$\nto be a member of $K$, however many interesting examples of factor\nembeddable classes are in fact closed under products. Factor embeddable\nclasses that are closed under finite products (or equivalently under\nbinary products) have the joint embedding property. Factor embeddable\nclasses closed under arbitrary products have the strong joint embedding\nproperty.\n\n### Characterization\n\nFactor embeddable classes have an easy to prove but somewhat unintuitive\ncharacterization which does not mention the concepts of product or\nembedding:\n\nThe following are equivalent for a class $K$ of models [@UM]:\n\n1.  $K$ is factor embeddable.\n\n2.  For every pair of models $A,B \\in K$ there exists a homomorphism\n    $f : A \\rightarrow B$.\n\nTo see the above, suppose $K$ is factor embeddable and consider models\n$A,B \\in K$. Then there exists a factor embedding from $A$ into the\nproduct $A \\times B$. Composing this embedding with the projection onto\n$B$ gives a homomorphism $f : A \\rightarrow B$. Conversely suppose such\na homomorphism $f : A \\rightarrow B$ exists for all $A,B \\in K$ and\nconsider a family $ \\{ A_{i}:i \\in I \\} $ in $K$ and $j \\in I$. We can\ndefine a strong factor embedding\n$f : A_{j} \\rightarrow \\prod_{i \\in I}A_{i}$ by choosing homomorphisms\n$f_{i} : A_{j} \\rightarrow A_{i}$ for all $i \\in I$ with $f_{j}$ the\nidentity map on $A_{j}$, and then for all $a \\in A$ setting\n$f(a)_{i} = f_{i}(a)$ for each $i \\in I$. [@UM]\n\nThe above proof shows that the factor embeddings guaranteed to exist for\na factor embeddable class can always be chosen to be strong factor\nemebeddings. [@UM]\n\nA corollory of the above is that if there exists a model which is a\nretract of every member of a class $K$ then, $K$ is factor embeddable -\nin particular if the members of $K$ have one element submodels, then $K$\nis factor embeddable. [@UM] (A retract of a model is a submodel which is\nalso a quotient model such that the quotient map composed with the\nsubmodel embedding is the identity map.)\n\n### Examples\n\nThe following are examples of factor embeddable classes:\n\n-   The variety of all groups (the trivial group is a one element\n    subalgebra of every group)\n\n-   The variety of all lattices (every lattice has one element\n    sublattices)\n\n-   The class of all non-trivial Boolean algebras (the two element\n    Boolean algebra is a retract of all non-trivial Boolean algebras)\n\nThe class of all Boolean algebras is an example of a class which is not\nfactor embeddable - there is no way to embed the trivial Boolean algebra\ninto a product of itself with any non-trivial Boolean algebras. (The\ntrivial Boolean algebra satisfies the identity $0=1$ which is not\nsatisfied by any Boolean algebra having more than one element.)\n\n[1]{} Peter Bruyns, Henry Rose: *Varieties with cofinal sets: examples\nand amalgamation*, Proc.
