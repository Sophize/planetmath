  "definition": "### Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n\nA *quantifier* is a logical symbol which makes an assertion about the\nset of values which make one or more formulas true. This is an\nexceedingly general concept; the vast majority of mathematics is done\nwith the two standard quantifiers, $\\forall$ (for all) and $\\exists$\n(there exists).\n\nThe *universal quantifier* $\\forall$ takes a variable $x$ and a formula,\nwhich may or may not contain $x$, and asserts that the formula holds for\nany value of $x$ (the value as being taken from some given universe\n$A$). A typical example would be a sentence like:\n\n$$\\forall x [0\\leq x]$$\n\nwhich states that no matter what value $x$ takes (from $A$), $0\\leq x$.\n\nThe *existential quantifier* $\\exists$ is the dual; that is the formula\n$\\exists x \\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\neg\\forall x \\neg\\phi(x)$. It\nstates that there is some $x$ satsifying the formula, as in\n\n$$\\exists x [x>0]$$\n\nwhich states that there is some value of $x$ greater than $0$.\n\n**Remark**. In practice, for simplicity, one usually writes\n$\\exists x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n \\phi(x_1,\\ldots, x_n)$ or\n$\\exists \\boldsymbol{x} \\phi(\\boldsymbol{x})$ (where\n$\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$), instead of\n$\\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\cdots \\exists x_n \\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$.\n\n### Scopes {#scopes .unnumbered}\n\nThe *scope* of a quantifier is the portion of a formula where it binds\nits variables. Note that previous bindings of a variable are overridden\nwithin the scope of a quantifier. In the examples above, the scope of\nthe quantifiers was the entire formula, but that need not be the case.\nThe following is a more complicated use of quantifiers:\n\n$$\\forall x \\underbrace{[x=0 \\vee \\exists y \\overbrace{[x=y+1 \\wedge (y=0\\vee\\exists x \\underbrace{[y=x+1]}_{\\dagger})]}^{\\text{The scope of the first existential quantifier.}}]}_{\\text{The scope of the universal quantifier.}}$$\n\n$\\dagger$:The scope of the second existential quantifier. Within this\narea, all references to $x$ refer to the variable bound by the\nexistential quantifier. It is impossible to refer directly to the one\nbound by the universal quantifier.\n\nAs that example illustrates, it can be very confusing when one\nquantifier overrides another. Since it does not change the meaning of a\nsentence to change a bound variable and all bound occurrences of it, it\nis better form to replace sentences like that with an equivalent but\nmore readable one like:\n\n$$\\forall x [x=0 \\vee \\exists y [x=y+1 \\wedge (y=0\\vee\\exists z [y=z+1])]]$$\n\nThese sentences both assert that every number is either equal to zero,\nor that there is some number one less than it, and that the number one\nless than it is also either zero or has a number one less than it.\n\\[Note: This is not the most useful of sentences. It would be nice to\nreplace this with a mathematically simple sentence which uses nested\nquantifiers meaningfully.\\]\n\n### Variations {#variations .unnumbered}\n\nThe quantifiers may not range over all objects. That is,\n$\\forall x\\phi(x)$ may not specify that $x$ can be any object, but\nrather any object belonging to some class of objects. Similarly\n$\\exists x\\phi(x)$ may specify that there is some $x$ within that class\nwhich satisfies $\\phi$. For instance second order logic has two\nuniversal quantifiers, $\\forall^1$ and $\\forall^2$ (with corresponding\nexistential quantifiers), and variables bound by them only range over\nthe first and second order objects respectively. So\n$\\forall^1 x [0\\leq x]$ only states that all numbers are greater than or\nequal to $0$, not that sets of numbers are as well (which would be\nmeaningless).\n\nA particular use of a quantifier is called *bounded* or *restricted* if\nit limits the objects to a smaller range. This is not quite the same as\nthe situation mentioned above; in the situation above, the definition of\nthe quantifier does not include all objects. In this case, quantifiers\ncan range over everything, but in a particular formula it doesn\u2019t. This\nis expressed in first order logic with formulas like these four:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\forall x [x<c\\rightarrow \\phi(x)]&\n\\forall x[x\\in X\\rightarrow \\phi(x)]&\n\\exists x[x<c \\wedge \\phi(x)]&\n\\exists x[x\\in X\\wedge \\phi(X)]\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe restriction is often incorporated into the quantifier. For instance\nthe first example might be written $\\forall x<c[\\phi(c)]$.\n\nA quantifier is called *vacuous* if the variable it binds does not\nappear anywhere in its scope, such as $\\forall x\\exists y[0\\leq x]$.\nWhile vacuous quantifiers do not change the meaning of a sentence, they\nare occasionally useful in finding an equivalent formula of a specific\nform.\n\nWhile these are the most common quantifiers (in particular, they are the\nonly quantifiers appearing in classical first-order logic), some logics\nuse others. The quantifier $$\\exists! x\\phi(x),$$ which means that there\nis a unique $x$ satsifying $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to\n$$\\exists x[\\phi(x)\\wedge\\forall y[\\phi(y)\\rightarrow x=y]].$$\n\nOther quantifiers go beyond the usual two. Examples include interpreting\n$Q x\\phi(x)$ to mean there are an infinite (or uncountably infinite)\nnumber of $x$ satisfying $\\phi(x)$. More elaborate examples include the\nbranching Henkin quantifier, written:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cc}\\forall x&\\exists y\\\\\\forall a&\\exists b\\end{array}\\phi(x,y,a,b)$$\n\nThis quantifier is similar to\n$\\forall x\\exists y\\forall a\\exists b\\phi(x,y,a,b)$ except that the\nchoice of $a$ and $b$ cannot depend on the values of $x$ and $y$. This\nconcept can be further generalized to the game-semantic, or\nindependence-friendly, quantifiers. All of these quantifiers are\nexamples of generalized quantifiers.",
