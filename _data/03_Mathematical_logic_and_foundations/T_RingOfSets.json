  "definition": "Ring of Sets {#ring-of-sets .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nLet $S$ be a set and $2^S$ be the power set of $S$. A subset\n$\\mathcal{R}$ of $2^S$ is said to be a *ring of sets* of $S$ if it is a\nlattice under the intersection and union operations. In other words,\n$\\mathcal{R}$ is a ring of sets if\n\n-   for any $A,B\\in \\mathcal{R}$, then $A\\cap B\\in \\mathcal{R}$,\n\n-   for any $A,B\\in \\mathcal{R}$, then $A\\cup B\\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\nA ring of sets is a distributive lattice. The word \u201cring\u201d in the name\nhas nothing to do with the ordinary ring found in algebra. Rather, it is\nan abelian semigroup with respect to each of the binary set operations.\nIf $S\\in\\mathcal{R}$, then $(\\mathcal{R},\\cap,S)$ becomes an abelian\nmonoid. Similarly, if $\\varnothing\\in\\mathcal{R}$, then\n$(\\mathcal{R},\\cup,\\varnothing)$ is an abelian monoid. If both\n$S,\\varnothing\\in\\mathcal{R}$, then $(\\mathcal{R},\\cup,\\cap)$ is a\ncommutative semiring, since\n$\\varnothing\\cap A=A\\cap\\varnothing=\\varnothing$, and $\\cap$ distributes\nover $\\cup$. Dualizing, we see that $(\\mathcal{R},\\cap,\\cup)$ is also a\ncommutative semiring. It is perhaps with this connection that the name\n\u201cring of sets\u201d is so chosen.\n\nSince $S$ is not required to be in $\\mathcal{R}$, a ring of sets can in\ntheory be the empty set. Even if $\\mathcal{R}$ may be non-empty, it may\nbe a singleton. Both cases are not very interesting to study. To avoid\nsuch examples, some authors, particularly measure theorists, define a\nring of sets to be a non-empty set with the first condition above\nreplaced by\n\n-   for any $A,B\\in \\mathcal{R}$, then $A-B\\in \\mathcal{R}$.\n\nThis is indeed a stronger condition, as\n$A\\cap B=A-(A-B)\\in \\mathcal{R}$. However, we shall stick with the more\ngeneral definition here.\n\nField of Sets {#field-of-sets .unnumbered}\n-------------\n\nAn even stronger condition is to insist that not only is $\\mathcal{R}$\nnon-empty, but that $S\\in\\mathcal{R}$. Such a ring of sets is called a\nfield, or algebra of sets. Formally, given a set $S$, a *field of sets*\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of $S$ satisfies the following criteria\n\n-   $\\mathcal{F}$ is a ring of sets of $S$,\n\n-   $S\\in\\mathcal{F}$, and\n\n-   if $A\\in\\mathcal{F}$, then the complement\n    $\\overline{A}\\in\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nThe three conditions above are equivalent to the following three\nconditions:\n\n-   $\\varnothing\\in\\mathcal{F}$,\n\n-   if $A,B\\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $A\\cup B\\in \\mathcal{F}$, and\n\n-   if $A\\in\\mathcal{F}$, then $\\overline{A}\\in\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nA field of sets is also known as an *algebra of sets*.\n\nIt is easy to see that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a distributive complemented\nlattice, and hence a Boolean lattice. From the discussion earlier, we\nalso see that $\\mathcal{F}$ (of $S$) is a commutative semiring, with $S$\nacting as the multiplicative identity and $\\varnothing$ both the\nadditive identity and the multiplicative absorbing element.\n\n**Remark**. Two remarkable theorems relating to of certain lattices as\nrings or fields of sets are the following:\n\n1.  a lattice is distributive iff it is to a ring of sets (G. Birkhoff\n    and M. Stone);\n\n2.  a lattice is iff it is lattice to a field of sets (M. Stone).\n\n[7]{} P. R. Halmos: [*Lectures on Boolean Algebras*]{}, Springer-Verlag\n(1970). P. R.
