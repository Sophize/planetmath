  "definition": "A set $A$ is said to be *embeddable* in another set $B$ if there is a\none-to-one function $f:A\\to B$. For example, every subset of a set is\nembeddable in the set. In particular, $\\varnothing$ is embeddable in\nevery set. Clearly, given any set, there is an ordinal embeddable in it.\nOn the other hand, is any set embeddable in an ordinal? If so, then the\nset is well-orderable (as it is equipollent to one), which is equivalent\nto the well-ordering principle. In other words, in ZF, AC is equivalent\nto saying that every set is embeddable in an ordinal. Without AC, how\nmuch can one deduce? In 1915, Hartogs proved the following:\n\nGiven any set $A$, there is an ordinal $\\alpha$ not embeddable in $A$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the class of all ordinals embeddable in $A$. We want to\nshow that $\\alpha$ is in fact an ordinal, not embeddable in $A$. We have\nthe following steps:\n\n-   $\\alpha$ is a set.\n\n    Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the subset of $P(A)$, the powerset of $A$,\n    consisting of all well-orderable subsets of $A$. For each element of\n    $B\\in \\mathcal{B}$, let $W(B)$ be the collection of well-orderings\n    on $B$. Each element of $W(B)$ is a subset of $B\\times B$, so that\n    $W(B)\\in P(B\\times B)$. For any $R\\in W(B)$, the well-ordered set\n    $(B,R)$ is order isomorphic to exactly one element $\\beta$ of\n    $\\alpha$. Conversely, every $\\beta\\in \\alpha$, by definition, is\n    embeddable in $A$, so equipollent to a subset $B$ of $A$. We may\n    well-order $B$ via $\\beta$, and this well-ordering $R\\in W(B)$.\n    Therefore, there is a surjection from\n    $W:=\\lbrace (B,R)\\mid B\\in \\mathcal{B}, R\\in W(B)\\rbrace$ onto\n    $\\alpha$. Since $W$ is a set, so is its range (by the replacement\n    axiom), which is just $\\alpha$.\n\n-   $\\alpha$ is an ordinal.\n\n    Since $\\alpha$ is a set consisting of ordinals, $\\alpha$ is\n    well-ordered. Now, suppose $\\gamma\\in \\beta \\in \\alpha$. Since\n    $\\beta$ is an ordinal, $\\gamma\\subseteq \\beta$. If\n    $\\phi: \\beta \\to (B,R)$ is an order isomorphism, then $\\phi$\n    restricted to $\\gamma$ is an order isomorphism onto\n    $\\phi(\\gamma)\\subseteq A$, whose well-ordering is that induced by\n    $R$. Therefore, $\\gamma \\in \\alpha$, so $\\alpha$ is a transitive\n    set. This shows that $\\alpha$ is an ordinal.\n\n-   $\\alpha$ is not embeddable in $A$.\n\n    Otherwise, $\\alpha\\in \\alpha$, contradicting the fact that an\n    ordinal can never be a member of itself.\n\nThe proof is done within ZF, without the aid of the axiom of choice.\n\nSince the class of ordinals **On** is well-ordered, so is the subclass\n$C$ of all ordinals not embeddable in $A$. The least element in $C$ is\ncalled the *Hartogs number* of $A$, and is denoted by $h(A)$.\n\nIn fact, the $\\alpha$ constructed above is the Hartogs number of $A$,\nfor if $\\delta$ is another ordinal distinct from $\\alpha$ that is not\nembeddable in $A$, then $\\delta \\notin \\alpha$, so $\\alpha\\in \\delta$ by\ntrichotomy.\n\n**Remark**. For every set $A$, its Hartogs number $h(A)$ is a cardinal\nnumber: it is first of all an ordinal, so $|h(A)|\\le h(A)$, where $\\le$\nis the ordering on the ordinals, and if $|h(A)| < h(A)$ (meaning\n$|h(A)|\\in h(A)$), then $|h(A)|$ is embeddable in $A$. Since $h(A)$ is\nequipollent to $|h(A)|$, $h(A)$ is embeddable in $A$, contradicting the\ndefinition of $h(A)$. Hence $h(A)=|h(A)|$. From the discussion so far,\nwe see that $h$ can be thought of as a class function from the class $V$\nof all sets onto the class **Cn** of all cardinal numbers. In addition,\nassuming AC, every set is well-orderable, so that $h(A)$ is the least\ncardinal greater $|A|$, for every set $A$.",
