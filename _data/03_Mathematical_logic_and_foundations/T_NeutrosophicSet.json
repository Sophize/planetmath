  "definition": "Let $M$ be a subset of a universe of discourse $U$. Each element\n$x\\in U$ has degrees of membership, indeterminacy, and non-membership in\n$M$, which are subsets of the hyperreal interval $]^-0,1^+[$. The\nnotation $x(T, I, F) \\in M$ means that\n\n-   the degree of membership of $x$ in $M$ is $T$;\n\n-   the degree of indeterminacy of $x$ in $M$ is $I$; and\n\n-   the degree of non-membership of $x$ in $M$ is $F$.\n\n$M$ is called *neutrosophic set*, whereas $T, I, F$ are called\n*neutrosophic components* of the element $x$ with respect to $M$.\n\nNow let\u2019s explain the previous notations: A number $\\varepsilon$ is said\nto be *infinitesimal* if and only if for all positive integers $n$ one\nhas $|\\varepsilon| < \\frac{1}{n}$. Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be a such\ninfinitesimal number. The *hyper-real number set* is an extension of the\nreal number set, which includes classes of infinite numbers and classes\nof infinitesimal numbers. Generally, for any real number $a$ one defines\n$^-a$ which signifies a *monad*, i.e. a set of hyper-real numbers in\nnon-standard analysis, as follows:\n$^-a = \\{a-\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$, and similarly one defines $a^+$, which is also a\nmonad, as: $a^+ = \\{a+\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$. A *binad* $^-a^+$ is a union of the above two\nmonads, i.e. $ ^-a^+ = ^-a \\cup a^+$. For example: The non-standard\nfinite number $1^+ = 1+\\varepsilon$, where $1$ is its *standard part*\nand $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*, and similarly the\nnon-standard finite number $^-0 = 0-\\varepsilon$, where $0$ is its\nstandard part and $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*. Similarly for\n$3^+ = 3+ \\varepsilon$, etc. Note that $] ^-0, 1^+ [$ is called the\n*non-standard unit interval*. More information on hyperreal intervals .\n\nThe superior sum of the neutrosophic components is defined as\n$$n_{sup} = sup(T) + sup(I) + sup(F) \\in ] ^-0, 3^+[$$ which may be as\nhigh as 3 or $3^+$. While the inferior sum of the neutrosophic\ncomponents is defined as\n$$n_{inf} = inf(T) + inf(I) + inf(F) \\in ] ^-0, 3^+[$$ which may be as\nlow as 0 or $^-0$.\n\nThe notion of neutrosophic set was introduced by Florentin Smarandache\nin 1995 as a generalization of *fuzzy set* (especially of intuitionistic\nfuzzy set) when $n_{sup} = 1$, of *intuitionistic set* when\n$n_{sup} < 1$, and of *paraconsistent set* when $n_{sup} > 1$.\n\nThe main distinctions between the neutrosophic set (NS) and\nintuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) are the facts that (a) the sum of the\nscalar neutrosophic components (or their superior sum, $n_{sup}$, if the\nneutrosophic components are subsets) in NS is not necessarily 1 as in\nIFS but any number from $^-0$ to $3^+$ in order to allow the\ncharacterization of incomplete or paraconsistent information, and (b) in\nNS one uses the non-standard interval $]^-0, 1^+[$ in order to make a\ndifference between *absolute membership*, denoted by $1^+$, and\n*relative membership*, denoted by $1$, while in IFS one only uses the\nstandard interval $[0, 1]$.\n\n[**An example**]{}: Let $A$ be a neutrosophic set. One can say, by abuse\nof language, that any element *neutrosophically* belongs to any set, due\nto the flexibility of degrees of truth/indeterminacy/falsity involved,\nwhich each varies between $^-0$ and $1^+$. Thus the element\n$x(0.1, 0.2, 0.3) \\in A$ means, the degree of membership of $x$ in $A$\nis 0.1, the degree on indeterminacy (undecidability) is 0.2, and the\ndegree of non-membership is 0.3 (as one sees, the sum of components is\n&lt; 1). Similarly the element $y(0.6, 0.2, 0.5) \\in A$, with the sum of\ncomponents &gt; 1. Or the element $z(0.7, 0.1, 0.2) \\in A$, with the sum\nof components = 1. More general, the element\n$w( (0.20-0.30), (0.40-0.45) \\cup [0.50-0.51], \\{0.20, 0.24, 0.28\\} ) \\in A$,\nmeans: - the degree of membership is between 0.20-0.30 (one cannot find\nan exact approximation because of various sources used); - the degree of\nindeterminacy related to the appurtenance of $w$ to $A$ is between\n0.40-0.45 or between 0.50-0.51 (limits included); - the degree of\nnon-membership is 0.20 or 0.24 or 0.28.\n\n[**A remark**]{}: - In technical applications, where there is no need\nfor distinctions between absolute membership and relative membership, we\ncan use standard subsets instead of non-standard subsets and\nrespectively the unit interval $[0,1]$ instead of the non-standard unit\ninterval $]^-0, 1^+[$.\n\n[9]{} F.
