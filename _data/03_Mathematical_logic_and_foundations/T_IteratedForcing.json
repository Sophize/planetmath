(Translated, this\nmeans that any generic subset including $g$ restricted to $i$ forces\nthat $f(i)$, an element of $\\hat{Q}_i$, be less than $g(i)$.)\n\nFor $\\beta<\\alpha$, $\\hat{Q}_\\beta$ is a forcing notion in $P_\\beta$ (so\n$\\Vdash_{P_\\beta} \\hat{Q}_\\beta$` is a forcing notion`).\n\nThen the sequence $\\langle \\hat{Q}_\\beta\\rangle_{\\beta<\\alpha}$ is an\niterated forcing.\n\nIf $P_\\beta$ is restricted to finite functions that it is called a\n*finite support iterated forcing* (FS), if $P_\\beta$ is restricted to\ncountable functions, it is called a *countable support iterated\nfunction* (CS), and in general if each function in each $P_\\beta$ has\nsize less than $\\kappa$ then it is a *$<\\kappa$-support iterated\nforcing*.\n\nTypically we construct the sequence of $\\hat{Q}_\\beta$\u2019s by induction,\nusing a function $F$ such that\n$F(\\langle \\hat{Q}_\\beta\\rangle_{\\beta<\\gamma})=\\hat{Q}_\\gamma$.",
