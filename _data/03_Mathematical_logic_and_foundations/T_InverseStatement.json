  "definition": "Let a statement be of the form of an implication\n\nIf $p$, then $q$\n\n, it has a certain premise $p$ and a conclusion $q$. The statement in\nwhich one has negated the conclusion and the premise,\n\nIf $\\neg p$, then $\\neg q$\n\nis the *inverse* (or *inverse statement*) of the first. Note that the\nfollowing constructions yield the same statement:\n\n-   the inverse of the original statement;\n\n-   the contrapositive of the converse of the original statement;\n\n-   the converse of the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, just as an implication and its contrapositive are logically\nequivalent (proven ), the converse of the original statement and the\ninverse of the original statement are also logically equivalent.\n\nThe phrase \u201cinverse theorem\u201d is in usage; however, it is nothing akin to\nthe phrase \u201c\u201d. In the phrase \u201cinverse theorem\u201d, the word \u201cinverse\u201d\ntypically refers to a multiplicative inverse. An example of this usage\nis the .",
