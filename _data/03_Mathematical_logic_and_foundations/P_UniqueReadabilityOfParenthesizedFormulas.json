  "statement": "Given a set $V$ of propositional variables, and a set $F$ of logical\nconnectives, one may form the set $\\overline{V}$ of well-formed\nformulas, or wffs. The appearance of a wff depends on the formation rule\nof a well-formed formula. Auxiliary symbols may or may not be used in\nthe construction of a wff. In the parent entry, we proved that every\nwell-formed formula constructed without the aid of auxiliary symbols has\na unique appearance. In this entry, we show that, with the aid of\nauxiliary symbols such as parentheses, specifically, unique readability\nis achieved as well. The specific formation rule we have in mind is the\nfollowing: if $p_1,\\ldots, p_n$ are existing wffs, and $\\alpha$ is\n$n$-ary, then so is $(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$ a wff.\n\nWffs constructed using the formation rule above have unique readability.\n\nWe will only give a partial proof here, since the portion not proved can\nbe easily produced by closely following the proof from the parent entry.\n\nA wff has one of the following three forms: $v$, $(\\#)$, or\n$(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$, where $v$ is atomic (propositional variable),\n$\\#$ and $\\alpha$ are nullary and $n$-ary connectives respectively, with\n$n>0$, and all $p_i$ are existing wffs.\n\nFirst, it is easy to see that every wff has the same number of left\nparentheses as right parentheses, and every proper non-trivial initial\nsegment of a wff has more left than right parentheses.\n\nNow, suppose $p$ and $q$ are wffs and $p=q$. We look at the following\ncases:\n\n-   If $p$ is atomic, then so must be $q$, and vice versa.\n\n-   If $p = (\\#)$, then $q$ is either $(@)$ where $@$ is nullary, or\n    $q=(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$, where $\\alpha$ is $n$-ary with $n>0$.\n    However, the second choice is not possible, as the length of the\n    word $(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$ is longer than $(\\#)$. So we are left\n    with $(@)$. Canceling the parentheses in the equation $(\\#)=(@)$, we\n    have $\\#=@$.\n\n-   If $p=(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$, then $q$ must have the form\n    $(\\beta q_1 \\cdots q_m)$. Equating the two expressions and canceling\n    the parentheses, we get $\\alpha =\\beta$ and thus $m=n$. By an\n    argument similar to the one given in the parent entry, we see that\n    $p_n=q_n$, utilizing the function $\\phi^*$ modified so that\n    $\\phi(()=\\phi())=0$. Continuing this, we see that $p_i=q_i$ for all\n    $i=1,\\ldots, n$.\n\nIn all three cases, we have unique readability, the proof is complete.\n\nCommas are also often used as auxiliary symbols in forming wffs to\nimprove comprehensibility without violating unique readability.\n\nWffs constructed using the following formula formation rule have unique\nreadability: if $p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ are existing wffs, and $\\alpha$ is\n$n$-ary, then so is $\\alpha(p_1, \\ldots, p_n)$ a wff.\n\nLike the last proof, a wff also has one of the three forms: $v$, $(\\#)$,\nor $\\alpha( p_1, \\cdots, p_n)$, where $v$ is atomic (propositional\nvariable), $\\#$ and $\\alpha$ are nullary and $n$-ary connectives\nrespectively, with $n>0$, and all $p_i$ are existing wffs.\n\nThe rest of the proof goes pretty much the same as the last one. The\nlast case deserves a little more attention:\n\nIf $p=\\alpha (p_1, \\ldots, p_n)$, and $q$ has the form\n$\\beta (q_1, \\ldots, q_m)$. We again have $\\alpha = \\beta$ and $m=n$,\nafter equating $p$ and $q$. Eliminating the parentheses, we get\n$p_1, \\ldots, p_n = q_1, \\ldots, q_n$. So $p_n$ is a suffix of\n$q_1, \\ldots, q_n$, which means that it is either a suffix of $q_n$, or\nhas the form $r,q_k,\\ldots, q_n$, where $r$ is a suffix of $q_{k-1}$,\nand $k\\le n$. In the latter case, if $r$ is the empty word, then\n$p_n = ,q_k,\\ldots, q_n$, which is impossible because no wffs begins\nwith a comma. So $r$ is a non-trivial suffix of $q_{k-1}$. Using\n$\\phi^*$ (see the parent entry) modified so that\n$\\phi(()=\\phi())=\\phi(,)=0$, we again show that $p_n$ can not be\n$r, q_k,\\ldots, q_n$. Therefore, $p_n$ is a suffix of $q_n$. We will let\nthe reader finish the rest.\n\nFinally, another common practice is to infix a connective when it is\nbinary. We again have unique readability:\n\nWffs constructed using the following formula formation rule have unique\nreadability: if $p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ are existing wffs, and $\\alpha$ is\n$n$-ary, then so is $(\\alpha p_1 \\ldots p_n)$ a wff if $n\\ne 2$, and so\nis $(p_1 \\alpha p_2)$ a wff if $n=2$.\n\nThe proof is very much the same as before. A wff in this case has four\nforms: $v$, $(\\#)$, $(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$, or $(q_1 \\beta q_2)$. We\nonly need to observe the following:\n\n-   if $p$ has the form $(\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n)$, and $p=q$, then $q$\n    can not have the form $(q_1 \\beta q_2)$, for otherwise $q_1$ begins\n    with $\\alpha$, which is impossible, because a wff never begins with\n    a connective symbol, as it either begins with a left parenthesis\n    $($, or is an atom.\n\n-   so $p$ has the form $(p_1 \\alpha p_2)$ and $q$ has the form\n    $(q_1 \\beta q_2)$, which means that $p_1$ is a prefix of\n    $q_1 \\beta q_2)$. Then $p_1$ is either a prefix of $q_1$, or has the\n    form $q_1 \\beta r$, where $r$ is a prefix of $q_2)$. Let us look at\n    the latter case. $r$ can not be the empty word, for otherwise\n    $p_1 = q_1 \\beta$, and no wffs end with a connective symbol. $r$ can\n    not be $q_2$ or $q_2)$, for otherwise $p_1 \\alpha p_2$ is longer (in\n    length) than $q_1 \\beta q_2$. So $r$ is a proper non-trivial prefix\n    of $q_2$, but this is also impossible, for then $r$ has more left\n    than right parentheses, which means $q_1\\beta r$, or $p_1$, a wff,\n    has more left than right parentheses. This shows that $p_1$ is a\n    prefix of $q_1$.\n\nThe rest of the proof is now easy.",
