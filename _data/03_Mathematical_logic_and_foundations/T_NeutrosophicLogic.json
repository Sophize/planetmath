  "definition": "A logic, in which each proposition is estimated to have the degree of\ntruth in $T$, the degree of indeterminacy (neither true nor false) in\n$I$, and the degree of false in $F$, is called *neutrosophic logic*,\nwhere $T, I, F$ are standard or non-standard real subsets of the\nnon-standard unit interval $]^-0, 1^+[$.\n\n$T, I, F$ are called *neutrosophic components*.\n\nNow let\u2019s explain the previous notations: A number $\\varepsilon$ is said\nto be *infinitesimal* if and only if for all positive integers $n$ one\nhas $|\\varepsilon| < \\frac{1}{n}$. Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be a such\ninfinitesimal number. The *hyper-real number set* is an extension of the\nreal number set, which includes classes of infinite numbers and classes\nof infinitesimal numbers. Generally, for any real number $a$ one defines\n$^-a$ which signifies a *monad*, i.e. a set of hyper-real numbers in\nnon-standard analysis, as follows:\n$^-a = \\{a-\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$, and similarly one defines $a^+$, which is also a\nmonad, as: $a^+ = \\{a+\\varepsilon: \\varepsilon \\in R^*, \\varepsilon$ is\ninfinitesimal $\\}$. A *binad* $^-a^+$ is a union of the above two\nmonads, i.e. $ ^-a^+ = ^-a \\cup a^+$. For example: The non-standard\nfinite number $1^+ = 1+\\varepsilon$, where $1$ is its *standard part*\nand $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*, and similarly the\nnon-standard finite number $^-0 = 0-\\varepsilon$, where $0$ is its\nstandard part and $\\varepsilon$ its *non-standard part*. Similarly for\n$3^+ = 3+ \\varepsilon$, etc. Note that $] ^-0, 1^+ [$ is called the\n*non-standard unit interval*.\n\nThe superior sum of the neutrosophic components is defined as:\n$$n_{sup} = sup(T) + sup(I) + sup(F) \\in ]^-0, 3^+[$$ may be as high as\n3 or $3^+$. While the inferior sum of the neutrosophic components is\ndefined as: $$n_{inf} = inf(T) + inf(I) + inf(F) \\in ]^-0, 3^+[$$ may be\nas low as 0 or $^-0$.\n\nNeutrosophic logic was introduced by Florentin Smarandache in 1995 as a\ngeneralization of *fuzzy logic* (especially of intuitionistic fuzzy\nlogic) when $n_{sup} = 1$, of *intuitionistic logic* when $n_{sup} < 1$,\nand of *paraconsistent logic* when $n_{sup} > 1$.\n\nThe main distinctions between the neutrosophic logic (NL) and\nintuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL) are the facts that (a) the sum of\nneutrosophic components (or of their superior limits when they are\nsubsets) in NL is not necessarily 1 as in IFL but any number from $^-0$\nto $3^+$ in order to allow the characterization of incomplete or\nparaconsistent information, and (b) in NL one uses a non-standard\ninterval $]^-0, 1^+[$ in order to make a difference in philosophy\nbetween *absolute truth*, denoted by $1^+$, and *relative truth*,\ndenoted by $1$, and similarly distinctions between *absolute falsehood*\nand *relative falsehood* or between *absolute indeterminacy* and\n*relative indeterminacy* respectively, while in IFL one has a standard\ninterval $[0, 1]$.\n\n[**Examples**]{}: - One uses a subset of truth (or indeterminacy, or\nfalsity), instead of a number, because in many cases we are not able to\nexactly determine the degrees of truth and of false but to approximate\nthem. - In technical applications, where there is no need for\ndistinctions between absolute truth and relative truth, we can use\nstandard subsets instead of non-standard subsets and respectively the\nunit interval $[0,1]$ instead of the non-standard unit interval\n$]^-0, 1^+[$. - Let say the proposition *One month from today it will be\nraining* can be between 0.30-0.40 or 0.45-0.50 true (according to\nvarious analyzers), 0.10 or 0.20 indeterminate (neither true nor false,\nbut unknown, due to possible hidden parameters that might influence the\nraining), and 0.60 or between 0.66-0.70 false. - The subsets are not\nnecessary intervals, but any sets (discrete, continuous, open or closed\nor half-open/half-closed interval, intersections or unions of the\nprevious sets, etc.) in accordance with the given proposition. - A\nsubset may also have only one element, which is the easiest particular\ncase of this logic.\n\n[9]{} Florentin Smarandache, [*A Unifying Field in Logics: Neutrosophic\nLogic.
