  "definition": "### Uniform Substitution {#uniform-substitution .unnumbered}\n\nOne area of mathematics where substitution plays a prominent role is\nmathematical logic. In this entry, we are mainly interested in\npropositional logic. Recall that a substitution is a function\n$s:\\Sigma_1^* \\to P(\\Sigma_2^*)$ preserving the empty word and\nconcatenation. In a propositional logic, $s$ has the following\nadditional characteristics:\n\n-   only one alphabet $\\Sigma$, often infinite, consisting of all\n    propositional variables, logical connectives, and parentheses, is\n    involved;\n\n-   $s$ maps to singletons, so we might as well think of $s$ as mapping\n    into $\\Sigma^*$;\n\n-   $s$ fixes the logical connectives and parentheses;\n\n-   $s(\\Sigma^*)$ is a set of well-formed formulas (rather than a set of\n    words over $\\Sigma$).\n\n$s$ is also called a *uniform substitution* because for any\npropositional variable $p$ that occurs in $A$, $s$ replaces each and\nevery occurrence of $p$ in $A$ by $s(p)$. In practice, we write\n$$A[B/p]$$ to mean change all occurrences of $p$ in $A$ by $B$, and\nleave all other variables fixed. This includes the case when $p$ does\nnot occur in $A$, in which case $A[B/p]=A$. $A[B/p]$ corresponds to a\nsubstitution that sends $p$ to $B$ and fixes all variables in $A$ not\nequal to $p$. This is called an *individual substitution*. More\ngenerally, $$A[B_1/p_1,\\ldots,B_n/p_n]$$ means: change all occurrences\nof $p_i$ in $A$ to $B_i$, for each $i=1,\\ldots,n$, and leave all other\nvariables fixed. This is called a *simultaneous substitution*, and\ncorresponds to a substitution that sends $p_i$ to $B_i$ and fixes all\nother variables in $A$. Simultaneous substitutions are not the same as\niterated individual substitutions:\n$$A[B_1/p_1,\\ldots, B_n/p_n] \\ne A[B_1/p_1]\\cdots [B_n/p_n].$$ For\nexample, if $A=p\\lor q$, then\n$A[q/p,p/q]= q\\lor p \\ne p\\lor p =A[q/p][p/q]$.\n\n### Recursive Definition of Substitution {#recursive-definition-of-substitution .unnumbered}\n\nSubstitutions can also be defined inducitvely, starting from\npropositional variables. For the sake of simplicity, we only define\nuniform substitutions on one variable.\n\n**Definition**. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are wff\u2019s, and $p$ a propositional\nvariable. Then\n\n1.  $A$ is a propositional variable. If $A$ is $p$, then $A[B/p]:=B$.\n    Otherwise, $A[B/p]:=A$.\n\n2.  $\\perp[B/p]:=\\perp$\n\n3.  If $A$ is $C\\to D$, then $A[B/p]:=C[B/p]\\to D[B/p]$.\n\n4.  If $A$ is $C\\land D$, then $A[B/p]:=C[B/p]\\land D[B/p]$.\n\n5.  If $A$ is $C\\lor D$, then $A[B/p]:=C[B/p]\\lor D[B/p]$.\n\nSince $\\neg A$ is $A\\to \\perp$, we see that $(\\neg A)[B/p]$ is\n$\\neg (A[B/p])$. In addition, if the language of the logic contains a\nmodal connective, say $\\square$, we have\n\n6.  If $A$ is $\\square C$, then $A[B/p]:=\\square C[B/p]$.\n\n### Sets Closed under Uniform Substitution {#sets-closed-under-uniform-substitution .unnumbered}\n\nA set $\\Lambda$ of wff\u2019s is said to be closed under uniform substitution\nif for any $A\\in \\Lambda$, $s(A)\\in \\Lambda$ for any (uniform)\nsubstitution $s$. We also say the set is closed under US (for uniform\nsubstitution), or obeys the rule of US. The smallest set containing a\nwff $A$ that is closed under US is called a *schema* based on $A$, and\nis denoted by $\\mathbf{A}$, the bold face version of $A$. An element of\n$\\mathbf{A}$ is called a *substitution instance*, or simply an\n*instance* of $A$. For example, if $A$ is $p\\to (q\\to p)$, where $p$ and\n$q$ are propositional variables, then\n$$(D\\to B)\\to (((D\\to B)\\to C) \\to (D\\to B))$$ is a substitution\ninstance of $A$, where $p$ is replaced by $D\\to B$ and $q$ by\n$(D\\to B)\\to C$.\n\nIt is easy to see that a set is closed under US iff it is closed under\nindividual substitution (IS). Obviously, one direction is clear, as IS\nis just special case of US. Conversely, suppose $A\\in \\Lambda$, which is\nclosed under IS. Let $p_1,\\ldots,p_n$ be all the propositional variables\nin $A$, and $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ are arbitrary wff\u2019s. Let $q_1,\\ldots, q_n$\nbe propositional variables, none of which occur in any of\n$A, X_1,\\ldots, X_n$. Then\n$$A[X_1/p_1,\\ldots,X_n/p_n]=A[q_1/p_1]\\cdots[q_n/p_n][X_1/q_1]\\cdots [X_n/q_n] \\in \\Lambda.$$\n\nThere are in general two ways to specify a given axiom system for a\npropositional logic:\n\n-   list wff\u2019s $A_1,A_2,\\ldots$ as axioms, and $R_1,\\ldots$ as inference\n    rules, including US, or\n\n-   list schemas $\\mathbf{A_1},\\mathbf{A_2},\\ldots$ as axiom schemas,\n    and $R_1,\\ldots$ as inference rules, excluding US\n\nBoth specifications are equivalent, in that they produce the same set of\ntheorems.\n\n### Non-Uniform Substitution {#non-uniform-substitution .unnumbered}\n\nIt is also possible to consider substitutions that only replace some,\nbut not all, occurrences of a propositional variable in a formula $A$,\nor replace a variable at different locations in $A$ by different\nformulas. For example, if $A$ is $(p\\to q)\\lor (q\\to p)$, then\n\n-   $(B\\to q)\\lor (B\\to p)$ is obtained by replacing the first\n    occurrences of $p$ and $q$ by $B$;\n\n-   $(B\\to q)\\lor (q\\to C)$ is obtained by replacing the first and\n    second occurrences of $p$ by $B$ and $C$ respectively.\n\nReplacements such as these are called *non-uniform substitutions*.\nTechnically, these are no longer substitutions, for they are no longer\nfunctions on $\\Sigma^*$, as individual variables may be mapped to\ndifferent things depending on their location in the formula. In the\nfirst example above, $p$ is mapped to both $B$ and $p$, depending on\nwhether it is the first or second occurrence in $A$.\n\nTo present a non-uniform substitution, let $\\overline{p}$ be the list\nall the propositional variables $p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ in $A$ in order. Note\nthat since a propositional variable $p_i$ may occur multiple times in\n$A$, $p$ may occur multiple times in $\\overline{p}$. Suppose each $p_i$\nis replaced by $B_i$. Let $\\overline{B}$ be the list $B_1,\\ldots, B_n$.\nThen we denote $$A[\\overline{B}/\\overline{p}]$$ by this non-uniform\nsubstitution. In the two examples above, $A[(B,q,B,p)/(p,q,q,p)]$ is the\nfirst wff, while $A[(B,q,q,C)/(p,q,q,p)]$ is the second.\n\nNevertheless, non-uniform substitution is useful in one respect:\npreservation of theoremhood. This fact is the famous substitution\ntheorem, which says, if $p_1,\\ldots, p_n$ are all the propositional\nvariables (not necessarily distinct) in a wff $A$ that are listed in\norder of appearance in $A$, then replacing each variable by deductively\nequivalent formulas produces equivalent result. In short, if\n$\\vdash B_i \\leftrightarrow C_i$ for $i=1,\\ldots, n$, then\n$$\\vdash A[\\overline{B}/\\overline{p}] \\leftrightarrow A[\\overline{C}/\\overline{p}].$$\n\nA set closed under non-uniform substitution (NUS) is defined in the same\nway as that of uniform substitution. It is easy to see that the smallest\nset closed under NUS containing the formula $A$ is the schema\n$\\mathbf{A[\\overline{q}/\\overline{p}]}$, where $\\overline{q}$ is a list\nof pairwise distinct propositional variables. For example, the smallest\nset closed under NUS containing $(p\\to q)\\lor (q\\to p)$ is\n$\\mathbf{(p\\to q)\\lor(r\\to s)}$. It is not hard to see that if the NUS\nclosure of a formula is used as an axiom schema for a logic, with modus\nponens as a rule of inference, then the logic is inconsistent.\n\n### First Order Logic {#first-order-logic .unnumbered}\n\nIn a first order logic, substitutions are more complicated. Given a wff\n$A$, $A[B/p]$ does not necessarily mean replacing all occurrences of $p$\nby $B$. Here, again, a substitution is no longer a substitution in the\nsense above. In fact, replacements of symbols, like non-uniform\nsubstitutions, are conditional on the locations of the symbols in the\nwff $A$. These conditions are collectively known as the\n*substitutability* of a term $B$ for the variable $p$, and is discussed\nin more detail .",
