  "definition": "The definition of a structure and of the satisfaction relation is nice,\nbut it raises the following question : how do we get models in the first\nplace? The most basic construction for models of first-order theory is\nthe construction that uses constants. Throughout this entry, $L$ is a\nfixed first-order language.\n\nLet $C$ be a set of constant symbols of $L$, and $T$ be a theory in $L$.\nThen we say $C$ is a [*set of witnesses*]{} for $T$ if and only if for\nevery formula $\\varphi$ with at most one free variable $x$, we have\n$T{\\vdash}\\exists x(\\varphi){\\Rightarrow}\\varphi(c)$ for some $c\\in C$.\n\n[**Lemma.**]{} Let $T$ is any consistent set of sentences of $L$, and\n$C$ is a set of new symbols such that $|C|=|L|$. Let $L'=L\\cup C$. Then\nthere is a consistent set $T'\\subseteq L'$ extending $T$ and which has\n$C$ as set of witnesses.\n\n[**Lemma.**]{} If $T$ is a consistent theory in $L$, and $C$ is a set of\nwitnesses for $T$ in $L$, then $T$ has a model whose elements are the\nconstants in $C$.\n\n[**Proof:**]{} Let $\\Sigma$ be the signature for $L$. If $T$ is a\nconsistent set of sentences of $L$, then there is a maximal consistent\n$T'\\supseteq T$. Note that $T'$ and $T$ have the same sets of witnesses.\nAs every model of $T'$ is also a model of $T$, we may assume $T$ is\nmaximal consistent.\n\nWe let the universe of ${\\mathfrak{M}}$ be the set of equivalence\nclasses $C/\\sim$, where $a\\sim b$ if and only if\n${\\text{``}}a=b{\\text{''}}\\in T$. As $T$ is maximal consistent, this is\nan equivalence relation. We interpret the non-logical symbols as follows\n:\n\n1.  $[a]=^{\\mathfrak{M}}[b]$ if and only if $a\\sim b$;\n\n2.  Constant symbols are interpreted in the obvious way, i.e. if\n    $c\\in \\Sigma$ is a constant symbol, then $c^{\\mathfrak{M}}=[c]$;\n\n3.  If $R\\in\\Sigma$ is an $n$-ary relation symbol, then\n    $([a_1],...,[a_n])\\in R^{\\mathfrak{M}}$ if and only if\n    $R(a_1,...,a_n)\\in T$;\n\n4.  If $F\\in\\Sigma$ is an $n$-any function symbol, then\n    $F^{\\mathfrak{M}}([a_0],...,[a_n])=[b]$ if and only if\n    ${\\text{``}}F(a_1,...,a_n)=b{\\text{''}}\\in T$.\n\nFrom the fact that $T$ is maximal consistent, and $\\sim$ is an\nequivalence relation, we get that the operations are well-defined (it is\nnot so simple, i\u2019ll write it out later). The proof that\n${\\mathfrak{M}}\\models T$ is a straightforward induction on the\ncomplexity of the formulas of $T$. $\\diamondsuit$\n\n[**Corollary.**]{} (The extended completeness theorem) A set $T$ of\nformulas of $L$ is consistent if and only if it has a model (regardless\nof whether or not $L$ has witnesses for $T$).\n\n[**Proof:**]{} First add a set $C$ of new constants to $L$, and expand\n$T$ to $T'$ in such a way that $C$ is a set of witnesses for $T'$. Then\nexpand $T'$ to a maximal consistent set $T''$. This set has a model\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$ consisting of the constants in $C$, and\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$ is also a model of $T$. $\\diamondsuit$\n\n[**Corollary.**]{} (Compactness theorem) A set $T$ of sentences of $L$\nhas a model if and only if every finite subset of $T$ has a model.\n\n[**Proof:**]{} Replace \u201chas a model\u201d by \u201cis consistent\u201d, and apply the\nsyntactic compactness theorem. $\\diamondsuit$\n\n[**Corollary.**]{} (G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem) Let $T$ be a\nconsistent set of formulas of $L$. Then A sentence $\\varphi$ is a\ntheorem of $T$ if and only if it is true in every model of $T$.\n\n[**Proof:**]{} If $\\varphi$ is not a theorem of $T$, then $\\neg\\varphi$\nis consistent with $T$, so $T\\cup\\{\\neg\\varphi\\}$ has a model\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$, in which $\\varphi$ cannot be true. $\\diamondsuit$\n\n[**Corollary.**]{} (Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem) If $T\\subseteq L$\nhas a model, then it has a model of power at most $|L|$.\n\n[**Proof:**]{} If $T$ has a model, then it is consistent. The model\nconstructed from constants has power at most $|L|$ (because we must add\nat most $|L|$ many new constants). $\\diamondsuit$\n\nMost of the treatment found in this entry can be read in more details in\nChang and Keisler\u2019s book [*Model Theory*]{}.",
