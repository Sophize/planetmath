  "definition": "Suppose we have some method $M$ of generating sequences of letters from\n$\\{p,q\\}$ so that at each generation the probability of obtaining $p$ is\n$x$, a real number strictly between $0$ and $1$.\n\nLet $\\{a_{i}:i<\\omega\\}$ be a set of vertices. For each $i<\\omega$ ,\n$i\\geq 1$ we construct a graph $G_{i}$ on the vertices\n$a_{1},\\ldots,a_{i}$ recursively.\n\n-   $G_{1}$ is the unique graph on one vertex.\n\n-   For $i>1$ we must describe for any $j<k\\leq i$ when $a_{j}$ and\n    $a_{k}$ are joined.\n\n    -   If $k<i$ then join $a_{j}$ and $a_{k}$ in $G_{i}$ iff $a_{j}$\n        and $a_{k}$ are joined in $G_{i-1}$\n\n    -   If $k=i$ then generate a letter $l(j,k)$ with $M$. Join $a_{j}$\n        to $a_{k}$ iff $l(j,k)=p$.\n\nNow let $\\Gamma$ be the graph on $\\{a_{i}:i<\\omega\\}$ so that for any\n$n,m <\\omega$, $a_{n}$ is joined to $a_{m}$ in $\\Gamma$ iff it is in\nsome $G_{i}$.\n\nThen we call $\\Gamma$ a *random graph*. Consider the following property\nwhich we shall call *f-saturation*:\n\nGiven any finite disjoint $U$ and $V$, subsets of $\\{a_{i}:i<\\omega\\}$\nthere is some $a_{n} \\in \\{a_{i}:i<\\omega\\} \\setminus (U \\cup V)$ so\nthat $a_{n}$ is joined to every point of $U$ and no points in $V$.\n\nA random graph has f-saturation with probability $1$.\n\nProof: Let $b_{1},b_{2},\\ldots,b_{n},\\ldots$ be an enumeration of\n$\\{a_{i}:i<\\omega\\} \\setminus (U \\cup V)$. We say that $b_{i}$ is\n[*correctly joined*]{} to $(U,V)$ iff it is joined to all the members of\n$U$ and non of the members of $V$. Then the probability that $b_{i}$ is\nnot correctly joined is $(1-x^{|U|}(1-x)^{|V|})$ which is some real\nnumber $y$ strictly between $0$ and $1$. The probability that none of\nthe first $m$ are correctly joined is $y^{m}$ and the probability that\nnone of the $b_{i}$s are correctly joined is\n$\\textrm{lim}_{n \\to \\infty} y^{n}=0$. Thus one of the $b_{i}$s is\ncorrectly joined.\n\nAny two countable graphs with f-saturation are isomorphic.\n\nProof: This is via a back and forth argument. The property of\nf-saturation is exactly what is needed.\n\nThus although the system of generation of a random graph looked as\nthough it could deliver many potentially different graphs, this is not\nthe case. Thus we talk about *the* random graph.\n\nThe random graph can also be constructed as a Fraisse limit of all\nfinite graphs, and in many other ways. It is homogeneous and universal\nfor the class of all countable graphs.\n\nThe theorem that almost every two infinite random graphs are isomorphic\nwas first proved in [@cite:erdos_renyi_randgr].\n\n[1]{}\n\nPaul Erd[\u0151]{}s and Alfr[\u00e9]{}d R[\u00e9]{}nyi.
