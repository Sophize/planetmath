  "definition": "A *signature* $\\Sigma$ is a set\n$$\\Sigma:=\\left(\\bigcup_{n\\in\\omega}\\mathcal{R}_n\\right)\\cup\\left(\\bigcup_{n\\in\\omega}\\mathcal{F}_n\n\\right)\\cup\\mathcal{C}$$ where for each natural number $n>0$,\n\n$\\bullet$\n\n:   $\\mathcal{R}_n$ is a (usually countable) set of $n$-ary relation\n    symbols.\n\n$\\bullet$\n\n:   $\\mathcal{F}_n$ is a (usually countable) set of $n$-ary function\n    symbols.\n\n$\\bullet$\n\n:   $\\mathcal{C}$ is a (usually countable) set of constant symbols.\n\nWe require that all these sets be pairwise disjoint.\n\nGiven a signature $\\Sigma$, a $\\Sigma$-structure is then a structure\n$\\mathcal{A}$, whose underlying set is some set $A$, with elements\n$\\mathcal{A}_c \\in A$ for each constant symbol $c\\in \\Sigma$, $n$-ary\noperations $\\mathcal{A}_f$ on $A$ for each $n$-ary function symbol\n$f\\in \\Sigma$, for each $n$, and $m$-ary relations $\\mathcal{A}_R$ on\n$A$ for each $m$-ary relation symbol $R\\in \\Sigma$.\n\nOn the other hand, every structure is associated with a signature. For\nevery structure, it has an underlying set, together with a collection of\n\u201cdesignated\u201d objects that \u201cdefine\u201d the structure. These objects may be\nelements of the underlying set, operations on the set, or relations on\nthe set. For each such \u201cdesignated\u201d object, pick a symbol for it. Make\nsure all symbols used are distinct from one another. Then the collection\nof all such symbols is a signature for the structure.\n\nFor most structures that we encounter, the set $\\Sigma$ is finite, but\nwe allow it to be infinite, even uncountable, as this sometimes makes\nthings easier, and just about everything still works when the signature\nis uncountable.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n-   A signature of sets is the empty set.\n\n-   A signature of pointed sets is a singleton consisting of a constant\n    symbol.\n\n-   A signature of groups is a set $\\lbrace e, ^{-1}, \\cdot \\rbrace$,\n    where\n\n    1.  $e$ (group identity symbol) is a constant symbol,\n\n    2.  $^{-1}$ (group inverse symbol) is a unary function symbol, and\n\n    3.  $\\cdot$ (group multiplication symbol) is a binary function\n        symbol.\n\n-   A signature of fields is a set\n    $\\lbrace 0,1, -, ^{-1}, +, \\cdot \\rbrace$, where\n\n    1.  $0$ (additive identity symbol) and $1$ (multiplicative identity\n        symbol) are constant symbols,\n\n    2.  $-$ (the additive inverse symbol) and $^{-1}$ (the\n        multiplicative inverse symbol) are the unary function symbols,\n        and\n\n    3.  $+$ (addition symbol) $\\cdot$ (multiplication symbol) are binary\n        function symbols.\n\n-   A signature of posets is a singleton $\\lbrace \\le \\rbrace$, where\n    $\\le$ (partial ordering symbol) is a binary relation symbol.\n\n-   A signature of vector spaces over a fixed field $k$ consists of the\n    following\n\n    1.  $0$ (additive identity symbol) is the constant symbol,\n\n    2.  $+$ (vector addition symbol) is the binary function symbol, and\n\n    3.  $\\cdot_r$ (multiplication by scalar $r$ symbol) is the unary\n        function symbol, for *each* $r\\in k$.\n\n**Remark**. Given a signature $\\Sigma$, the set $L$ of logical symbols\nfrom first order logic, and a countably infinite set $V$ of variables,\nwe can form a first order language, consisting of all formulas built\nfrom these symbols (in $\\Sigma\\cup L\\cup V$). The language so-created is\nuniquely determined by $\\Sigma$. In the literature, it is a common\npractice to identify $\\Sigma$ both as a signature and the unique\nlanguage it generates.\n\n[99]{} W.\u00a0Hodges, [*A Shorter Model Theory*]{}, Cambridge University\nPress, (1997).
