  "definition": "The language of (classical) propositional logic PL$_c$ consists of a set\nof propositional letters or variables, the symbol $\\perp$ (for falsity),\ntogether with two symbols for logical connectives $\\neg$ and $\\to$. The\nwell-formed formulas (wff\u2019s) of PL$_c$ are inductively defined as\nfollows:\n\n-   each propositional letter is a wff\n\n-   $\\perp$ is a wff\n\n-   if $A$ and $B$ are wff\u2019s, then $A\\to B$ is a wff\n\nWe also use parentheses $($ and $)$ to remove ambiguities. The other\nfamiliar logical connectives may be defined in terms of $\\to$: $\\neg A$\nis $A\\to \\perp$, $A\\lor B$ is the abbreviation for $\\neg A \\to B$,\n$A\\land B$ is the abbreviation for $\\neg (A\\to \\neg B)$, and\n$A \\leftrightarrow B$ is the abbreviation for $(A\\to B)\\land (B\\to A)$.\n\nThe axiom system for PL$_c$ consists of sets of wffs called *axiom\nschemas* together with a rule of inference. The axiom schemas are:\n\n1.  $A\\to (B\\to A)$,\n\n2.  $(A\\to (B\\to C)) \\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$,\n\n3.  $(\\neg A\\to \\neg B)\\to (B\\to A)$,\n\nand the rule of inference is modus ponens (MP): from $A\\to B$ and $A$,\nwe may infer $B$.\n\nA *deduction* is a finite sequence of wff\u2019s $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ such that\neach $A_i$ is either an instance of one of the axiom schemas above, or\nas a result of applying rule MP to earlier wff\u2019s in the sequence. In\nother words, there are $j,k<i$ such that $A_k$ is the wff $A_j \\to A_i$.\nThe last wff $A_n$ in the deduction is called a *theorem* of PL$_c$.\nWhen $A$ is a theorem of PL$_c$, we write\n$$\\vdash_c A \\qquad\\qquad \\mbox{or simply} \\qquad\\qquad \\vdash A.$$ For\nexample, $\\vdash A \\to A$, whose deduction is\n\n1.  $(A \\to ((B\\to A) \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to (B\\to A)) \\to (A \\to A))$ by\n    Axiom II,\n\n2.  $A \\to ((B \\to A) \\to A)$ by Axiom I,\n\n3.  $(A \\to (B\\to A)) \\to (A \\to A)$ by modus ponens on $2$ to $1$,\n\n4.  $A\\to (B\\to A)$ by Axiom I,\n\n5.  $A\\to A$ by modus ponens on $4$ to $3$.\n\nMore generally, given a set $\\Sigma$ of wff\u2019s, we write\n$$\\Sigma \\vdash A$$ if there is a finite sequence of wff\u2019s such that\neach wff is either an axiom, a member of $\\Sigma$, or as a result of\napplying MP to earlier wff\u2019s in the sequence. An important\n(meta-)theorem called the deduction theorem, states: if\n$\\Sigma, A \\vdash B$, then $\\Sigma \\vdash A\\to B$. The deduction theorem\nholds for PL$_c$ (proof )\n\n**Remark**. The axiom system above was first introduced by Polish\nlogician Jan ukasiewicz. Two axiom systems are said to be *deductively\nequivalent* if every theorem in one system is also a theorem in the\nother system. There are many axiom systems for PL$_c$ that are\ndeductively equivalent to ukasiewicz\u2019s system. One such system consists\nof the first two axiom schemas above, but the third axiom schema is\n$\\neg \\neg A \\to A$, with MP its sole inference rule.",
