  "definition": "A relation $\\mathcal{R}$ on a set $A$ is *reflexive* if and only if\n$a\\mathcal{R}a$ for all $a\\in A$.\n\nFor example, let $A = \\{1,2,3\\}$. Then\n$\\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3), (3,2)\\}$ is a reflexive relation on $A$,\nbecause it contains $(a,a)$ for all $a \\in A$. However,\n$\\{(1,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)\\}$ is not reflexive because it does not\ncontain $(3,3)$.\n\nOn a finite set with $n$ elements there are $2^{n^2}$ relations, of\nwhich $2^{n^2-n}$ are reflexive.",
