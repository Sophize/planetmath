  "argumentText": "If we have a rational number $p/q$ with $p$ and $q$ having no common\nfactor, and each expressed in base 10 then we can view $p/q$ as a base\n11 integer, where the digits are $0,1,2,\\ldots,9$ and $/$. That is,\nslash ($/$) is a symbol for a digit. For example, the rational 3/2\ncorresponds to the integer $3\\cdot 11^2 + 10\\cdot 11 + 2$. The rational\n$-3/2$ corresponds to the integer $-(3\\cdot 11^2 + 10 \\cdot 11 + 2)$.\n\nThis gives a one-to-one map into the integers so the cardinality of the\nrationals is at most the cardinality of the integers. So the rationals\nare countable.",
