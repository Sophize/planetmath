  "definition": "Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a function from sets $X$ to $Y$. A *quasi-inverse* $g$\nof $f$ is a function $g$ such that\n\n1.  $g:Z\\to X$ where $\\operatorname{ran}(f)\\subseteq Z\\subseteq Y$, and\n\n2.  $f\\circ g\\circ f=f$, where $\\circ$ denotes functional composition\n    operation.\n\nNote that $\\operatorname{ran}(f)$ is the range of $f$.\n\n**Examples.**\n\n1.  If $f$ is a real function given by $f(x)=x^2$. Then $g(x)=\\sqrt{x}$\n    defined on $[0,\\infty)$ and $h(x)=-\\sqrt{x}$ also defined on\n    $[0,\\infty)$ are both quasi-inverses of $f$.\n\n2.  If $f(x)=1$ defined on $[0,1)$. Then $g(x)=\\frac{1}{2}$ defined on\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ is a quasi-inverse of $f$. In fact, any $g(x)=a$ where\n    $a\\in [0,1)$ will do. Also, note that $h(x)=x$ on $[0,1)$ is also a\n    quasi-inverse of $f$.\n\n3.  If $f(x)=[x]$, the step function on the reals. Then by the previous\n    example, $g(x)=[x]+a$, any $a\\in[0,1)$, is a quasi-inverse of $f$.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n-   Every function has a quasi-inverse. This is just another form of the\n    Axiom of Choice. In fact, if $f:X\\to Y$, then for *every* subset $Z$\n    of $Y$ such that $\\operatorname{ran}(f)\\subseteq Z$, there is a\n    quasi-inverse $g$ of $f$ whose domain is $Z$.\n\n-   However, a quasi-inverse of a function is in general not unique, as\n    illustrated by the above examples. When it is unique, the function\n    must be a bijection:\n\n    > If $\\operatorname{ran}(f)\\ne Y$, then there are at least two\n    > quasi-inverses, one with domain $\\operatorname{ran}(f)$ and one\n    > with domain $Y$. So $f$ is onto. To see that $f$ is one-to-one,\n    > let $g$ be the quasi-inverse of $f$. Now suppose\n    > $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=z$. Let $g(z)=x_3$ and assume $x_3\\ne x_1$. Define\n    > $h:Y\\to X$ by $h(y)=g(y)$ if $y\\ne z$, and $h(z)=x_1$. Then $h$ is\n    > easily verified as a quasi-inverse of $f$ that is different from\n    > $g$. This is a contradition. So $x_3=x_1$. Similarly, $x_3=x_2$\n    > and therefore $x_1=x_2$.\n\n-   Conversely, if $f$ is a bijection, then the inverse of $f$ is a\n    quasi-inverse of $f$. In fact, $f$ has only one quasi-inverse.\n\n-   The relation of being quasi-inverse is not symmetric. In other\n    words, if $g$ is a quasi-inverse of $f$, $f$ need not be a\n    quasi-inverse of $g$. In the second example above, $h$ is a\n    quasi-inverse of $f$, but not vice versa: $h(0)=0$, but\n    $hfh(0)=hf(0)=h(1)=1\\ne h(0)$.\n\n-   Let $g$ be a quasi-inverse of $f$, then the restriction of $g$ to\n    $\\operatorname{ran}(f)$ is one-to-one. If $g$ and $f$ are\n    quasi-inverses of one another, and $\\operatorname{g}$ strictly\n    includes $\\operatorname{ran}(f)$, then $g$ is *not* one-to-one.\n\n-   The set of real functions, with addition defined element-wise and\n    multiplication defined as functional composition, is a ring. By\n    remark 2, it is in fact a Von Neumann regular ring, as any\n    quasi-inverse of a real function is also its pseudo-inverse as an\n    element of the ring. Any space whose ring of continuous functions is\n    Von Neumann regular is a P-space.\n\n[9]{} B. Schweizer, A. Sklar, *Probabilistic Metric Spaces*, Elsevier\nScience Publishing Company, (1983).",
