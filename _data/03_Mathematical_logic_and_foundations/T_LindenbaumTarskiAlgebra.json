  "definition": "### Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of a propositional langauge {#lindenbaum-tarski-algebra-of-a-propositional-langauge .unnumbered}\n\nLet $L$ be a classical propositional language. We define the equivalence\nrelation $\\sim$ over formulas of $L$ by $\\varphi\\sim\\psi$ if and only if\n${\\vdash}\\varphi{\\Leftrightarrow}\\psi$. Let $B=L/\\sim$ be the set of\nequivalence classes. We define the operations join $\\vee$, meet\n$\\wedge$, and complementation, denoted $[\\varphi]'$ on $B$ by :\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n[\\varphi]\\vee [\\psi]&:=[\\varphi{\\vee}\\psi]\\\\\n[\\varphi]\\wedge [\\psi]&:=[\\varphi{\\wedge}\\psi]\\\\\n[\\varphi]'&:=[\\neg\\varphi]\\end{aligned}$$ We let\n$0=[\\varphi{\\wedge}\\neg\\varphi]$ and $1=[\\varphi{\\vee}\\neg\\varphi]$.\nThen the structure $(B,\\vee,\\wedge,',0,1)$ is a Boolean algebra, called\nthe *Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra* of the propositional language $L$.\n\nIntuitively, this algebra is an algebra of logical statements in which\nlogically equivalent formulations of the same statement are not\ndistinguished. One can develop intuition for this algrebra by\nconsidering a simple case. Suppose our language consists of a number of\nstatement symbols $P_i$ and the connectives $\\lor, \\land, \\neg$ and that\n${\\vdash}$ denotes tautologies. Then our algebra consists of statements\nformed from these connectives with tautologously equivalent satements\nreckoned as the same element of the algebra. For instance,\n\u201c$\\neg (P_1 \\land P_2)$\u201d is considered the same as\n\u201c$\\neg P_1 \\lor \\neg P_2$\u201d. Furthermore, since any statement of\npropositional calculus may be recast in disjunctive normal form, we may\nview this particular Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra as a Boolean analogue of\npolynomials in the $P_i$\u2019s and their negations.\n\nIt can be shown that the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of the propositional\nlanguage $L$ is a free Boolean algebra freely generated by the set of\nall elements $[p]$, where each $p$ is a propositional variable of $L$\n\n### Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of a first order langauge {#lindenbaum-tarski-algebra-of-a-first-order-langauge .unnumbered}\n\nNow, let $L$ be a first order language. As before, we define the\nequivalence relation $\\sim$ over formulas of $L$ by $\\varphi\\sim\\psi$ if\nand only if ${\\vdash}\\varphi{\\Leftrightarrow}\\psi$. Let $B=L/\\sim$ be\nthe set of equivalence classes. The operations $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ and\ncomplementation on $B$ are defined exactly the same way as previously.\nThe resulting algebra is the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of the first\norder language $L$. It may be shown that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bigvee_{t\\in T}[\\varphi(t)]&:=[\\exists x \\varphi(x)]\\\\\n\\bigwedge_{t\\in T}[\\varphi(t)]&:=[\\forall x \\varphi(x)]\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $T$ is the set of all terms in the language $L$. Basically, these\nresults say that the statement $\\exists x \\varphi(x)$ is equivalent to\ntaking the supremum of all statements $\\varphi(x)$ where $x$ ranges over\nthe entire set $V$ of variables. In other words, if one of these\nstatements is true (with truth value $1$, as opposed to $0$), then\n$\\exists x\\varphi(x)$ is true. The statement $\\forall x\\varphi(x)$ can\nbe similarly analyzed.\n\n**Remark**. It may possible to define the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra on\nlogical languages other than the classical ones mentioned above, as long\nas there is a notion of formal proof that can allow the definition of\nthe equivalence relation. For example, one may form the\nLindenbaum-Tarski algebra of an intuitionistic propositional language\n(or predicate language) or a normal modal propositional language. The\nresulting algebra is a Heyting algebra (or a complete Heyting algebra)\nfor intuitionistic propositional language (or predicate language), or a\nBoolean algebras with an operator for normal modal propositional\nlanguages.",
