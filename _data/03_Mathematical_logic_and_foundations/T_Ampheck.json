  "definition": "**Ampheck**, from the Greek $\\alpha\\mu\\phi\\eta\\kappa\\eta\\varsigma$,\n*double-edged*, is a term coined by Charles Sanders Peirce for either\none of the pair of logically dual operators, variously referred to as\n*Peirce arrows*, *Sheffer strokes*, or logical NAND and logical NNOR.\nEither of these logical operators is a ** for defining all of the other\noperators in the subject matter variously described as boolean\nfunctions, monadic predicate calculus, propositional calculus,\nsentential calculus, or zeroth order logic. See ** for further\ndiscussion.\n\n> For example, $x \\curlywedge y$ signifies that $x$ is $\\mathbf{f}$ and\n> $y$ is $\\mathbf{f}$. Then $(x \\curlywedge y) \\curlywedge z$, or\n> $\\underline{x \\curlywedge y} \\curlywedge z$, will signify that $z$ is\n> $\\mathbf{f}$, but that the statement that $x$ and $y$ are both\n> $\\mathbf{f}$ is itself $\\mathbf{f}$, that is, is *false*. Hence, the\n> value of $x \\curlywedge x$ is the same as that of $\\overline{x}$; and\n> the value of $\\underline{x \\curlywedge x} \\curlywedge x$ is\n> $\\mathbf{f}$, because it is necessarily false; while the value of\n> $\\underline{x \\curlywedge y} \\curlywedge \\underline{x \\curlywedge y}$\n> is only $\\mathbf{f}$ in case $x \\curlywedge y$ is $\\mathbf{v}$; and\n> $(\\underline{x \\curlywedge x} \\curlywedge x) \\curlywedge (x \\curlywedge \\underline{x \\curlywedge x})$\n> is necessarily true, so that its value is $\\mathbf{v}$.\\\n> With these two signs, the vinculum (with its equivalents, parentheses,\n> brackets, braces, etc.) and the sign $\\curlywedge$, which I will call\n> the *ampheck* (from $\\alpha\\mu\\phi\\eta\\kappa\\eta\\varsigma$, cutting\n> both ways), all assertions as to the values of quantities can be\n> expressed. (C.S. Peirce, CP 4.264).\n\nIn the above passage, Peirce introduces the term *ampheck* for the\n2-place logical connective or the binary logical operator that is\ncurrently called the *joint denial* in logic, the NNOR operator in\ncomputer science, or indicated by means of phrases like \u201cneither-nor\u201d or\n\u201cboth not\u201d in ordinary language. In his handwritten manuscripts Peirce\nused a cursive symbol for the amphecks that he derived from his\n*dot-cross* notation for truth tables, one that the typographer most\nlikely set by inverting the zodiac symbol for Aries, and that is set in\nthe text above by using the so-called *curly wedge* symbol.\n\nIn the same paper, Peirce introduces a symbol for the logically dual\noperator. This was rendered by the editors of his *Collected Papers* as\nan inverted Aries symbol with a bar or a serif at the top, in this way\ndenoting the connective or logical operator that is currently called the\n*alternative denial* in logic, the NAND operator in computer science, or\ninvoked by means of phrases like \u201cnot-and\u201d or \u201cnot both\u201d in ordinary\nlanguage. It is not clear whether it was Peirce himself or later writers\nwho initiated the practice, but on account of their dual relationship it\nbecame common to refer to these two operators in the plural, as the\n*amphecks*.\n\nBibliography\n============\n\n-   Clark, Glenn (1997), \u201cNew Light on Peirce\u2019s Iconic Notation for the\n    Sixteen Binary Connectives\u201d, pp. 304\u2013333 in Houser, Roberts, Van\n    Evra (eds.), *Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce*,\n    Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN.\n\n-   Houser, Nathan; Roberts, Don D.; and Van Evra, James (eds., 1997),\n    *Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce*, Indiana University\n    Press, Bloomington, IN.\n\n-   McCulloch, Warren Sturgis (1961), \u201cWhat Is a Number, that a Man May\n    Know It, and a Man, that He May Know a Number?\u201d (Ninth Alfred\n    Korzybski Memorial Lecture), *General Semantics Bulletin*, Nos. 26 &\n    27, 7\u201318, Institute of General Semantics, Lakeville, CT.
