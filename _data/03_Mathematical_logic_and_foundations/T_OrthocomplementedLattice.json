  "definition": "An *orthocomplemented lattice* is a complemented lattice in which every\nelement has a distinguished complement, called an *orthocomplement*,\nthat behaves like the complementary subspace of a subspace in a vector\nspace.\n\nFormally, let $L$ be a complemented lattice and denote $M$ the set of\ncomplements of elements of $L$. $M$ is clearly a subposet of $L$, with\n$\\le$ inherited from $L$. For each $a\\in L$, let $M_a\\subseteq M$ be the\nset of complements of $a$. $L$ is said to be *orthocomplemented* if\nthere is a function $^{\\perp}:L \\to M$, called an\n*orthocomplementation*, whose image is written $a^{\\perp}$ for any\n$a\\in L$, such that\n\n1.  $a^{\\perp}\\in M_a$,\n\n2.  $(a^{\\perp})^{\\perp}=a$, and\n\n3.  $\\perp$ is order-reversing; that is, for any $a,b\\in L$, $a\\le b$\n    implies $b^{\\perp}\\le a^{\\perp}$.\n\nThe element $a^{\\perp}$ is called an *orthocomplement* of $a$ (via\n$^{\\perp}$).\n\n**Examples**. In addition to the example of the lattice of vector\nsubspaces of a vector space cited above, let\u2019s look at the Hasse\ndiagrams of the two finite complemented lattices below, $$\\xymatrix{\n& 1 \\ar@{-}[ld] \\ar@{-}[d] \\ar@{-}[rd] & \\\\\na \\ar@{-}[rd] & b \\ar@{-}[d] & c \\ar@{-}[ld] \\\\\n& 0 &\n}\n\\hspace{2cm}\n\\xymatrix{\n& & 1 \\ar@{-}[lld] \\ar@{-}[ld] \\ar@{-}[rd] \\ar@{-}[rrd] & & \\\\\na \\ar@{-}[rrd] & b \\ar@{-}[rd] & & c \\ar@{-}[ld] & d \\ar@{-}[lld] \\\\\n& & 0 & &\n}$$ the one on the right is orthocomplemented, while the one on the left\nis not. From this one deduces that orthcomplementation is not unique,\nand that the cardinality of any finite orthocomplemented lattice is\neven.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   From the first condition above, we see that an orthocomplementation\n    $\\perp$ is a bijection. It is one-to-one: if $a^{\\perp}=b^{\\perp}$,\n    then $a=(a^{\\perp})^{\\perp}=(b^{\\perp})^{\\perp}=b$. And it is onto:\n    if we pick $a\\in\n    M\\subseteq L$, then $(a^{\\perp})^{\\perp}=a$. As a result, $M=L$,\n    every element of $L$ is an orthocomplement. Furthermore, we have\n    $0^{\\perp}=1$ and $1^{\\perp}=0$.\n\n-   Let $L^{\\prime}$ be the dual lattice of $L$ (a lattice having the\n    same underlying set, but with meet and join operations switched).\n    Then any orthocomplementation $\\perp$ can be viewed as a lattice\n    isomorphism between $L$ and $L^{\\prime}$.\n\n-   From the above conditions, it follows that elements of $L$ satisfy\n    the de Morgan\u2019s laws: for $a,b\\in L$, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n    & a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp}=(a\\vee b)^{\\perp},\\\\\n    & a^{\\perp}\\vee b^{\\perp}=(a\\wedge b)^{\\perp}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n    To derive the first equation, first note $a\\le a\\vee b$. Then\n    $(a\\vee b)^{\\perp}\\le a^{\\perp}$. Similarly,\n    $(a\\vee b)^{\\perp}\\le b^{\\perp}$. So $(a\\vee b)^{\\perp}\\le\n    a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp}$. For the other inequality, we start with\n    $a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp}\\le a^{\\perp}$. Then\n    $a\\le (a^{\\perp}\\wedge\n    b^{\\perp})^{\\perp}$. Similarly,\n    $b\\le (a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp})^{\\perp}$. Therefore,\n    $a\\vee b\\le (a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp})^{\\perp}$, which implies that\n    $a^{\\perp}\\wedge b^{\\perp}\\le (a\\vee b)^{\\perp}$.\n\n-   Conversely, any of two equations in the previous remark can replace\n    the third condition in the definition above. For example, suppose we\n    have the second equation\n    $a^{\\perp}\\vee b^{\\perp}=(a\\wedge b)^{\\perp}$. If $a\\le b$, then\n    $a=a\\wedge b$, so\n    $a^{\\perp}=(a\\wedge b)^{\\perp}=a^{\\perp}\\vee b^{\\perp}$, which shows\n    that $b^{\\perp}\\le a^{\\perp}$.\n\n-   From the example above, one sees that orthocomplementation need not\n    be unique. An orthocomplemented lattice with a unique\n    orthocomplementation is said to be *uniquely orthocomplemented*. A\n    uniquely complemented lattice that is also orthocomplemented is\n    uniquely orthocomplemented.\n\n-   Orthocomplementation can be more generally defined over a bounded\n    poset $P$ by requiring the orthocomplentation operator $^{\\perp}$ to\n    satisfy conditions 2 and 3 above, and a weaker version of condition\n    1: $a\\wedge a^{\\perp}$ exists and $=0$. Since $^{\\perp}$ is an order\n    reversing bijection on $P$, $0^{\\perp}=1$ and $1^{\\perp}=0$. From\n    this, one deduces that $a\\wedge a^{\\perp}=0$ iff\n    $a\\vee a^{\\perp}=1$. A bounded poset in which an\n    orthocomplementation is defined is called an *orthocomplemented\n    poset*.\n\n-   In the category of orthocomplemented lattices, the morphism between\n    a pair of objects is a $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$- $f$ that preserves\n    orthocomplementation: $$f(a^{\\perp})=f(a)^{\\perp}.$$\n\n[8]{} G.
