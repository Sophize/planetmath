  "definition": "Let us recall that a function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is an\nassignment that takes each element of $A$ to a *unique* element of $B$.\nOne way to generalize this notion is to remove the *uniqueness* aspect\nof this assignment, and what results is a *multivalued function*.\nAlthough a multivalued function is in general not a function, one may\nformalize this notion mathematically as a function:\n\n**Definition**. A *multivalued function* $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$\nis a function $f: A\\to P(B)$, the power set of $B$, such that $f(a)$ is\nnon-empty for every $a\\in A$. Let us denote $f:A\\Rightarrow B$ the\nmultivalued function $f$ from $A$ to $B$.\n\nA multivalued function is said to be *single-valued* if $f(a)$ is a\nsingleton for every $a\\in A$.\n\nFrom this definition, we see that every function $f:A\\to B$ is naturally\nassociated with a multivalued function $f^*:A\\Rightarrow B$, given by\n$$f^*(a)=\\lbrace f(a)\\rbrace.$$ Thus a function is just a single-valued\nmultivalued function, and vice versa.\n\nAs another example, suppose $f:A\\to B$ is a surjective function. Then\n$f^{-1}:B\\Rightarrow A$ defined by\n$f^{-1}(b)=\\lbrace a\\in A \\mid f(a)=b\\rbrace$ is a multivalued function.\n\nAnother way of looking at a multivalued function is to interpret it as a\nspecial type of a relation, called a *total relation*. A relation $R$\nfrom $A$ to $B$ is said to be *total* if for every $a\\in A$, there\nexists a $b\\in B$ such that $aRb$.\n\nGiven a total relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$, the function\n$f_R: A\\Rightarrow B$ given by $$f_R(a)=\\lbrace b\\in B\\mid aRb\\rbrace$$\nis multivalued. Conversely, given $f:A \\Rightarrow  B$, the relation\n$R_f$ from $A$ to $B$ defined by\n$$a R_f b \\qquad\\mbox{iff}\\qquad b\\in f(a)$$ is total.\n\nBasic notions such as functional composition, injectivity and\nsurjectivity on functions can be easily translated to multivalued\nfunctions:\n\n**Definition**. A multivalued function $f:A\\Rightarrow B$ is *injective*\nif $f(a)=f(b)$ implies $a=b$, *absolutely injective* if $a\\ne b$ implies\n$f(a)\\cap f(b)=\\varnothing$, and *surjective* if every $b\\in B$ belongs\nto some $f(a)$ for some $a\\in A$. If $f$ is both injective and\nsurjective, it is said to be *bijective*.\n\nGiven $f:A\\Rightarrow B$ and $g:B\\Rightarrow C$, then we define the\n*composition* of $f$ and $g$, written $g\\circ f:A\\Rightarrow C$, by\nsetting\n$$(g\\circ f)(a):=\\lbrace c\\in C\\mid c\\in g(b)\\mbox{ for some }b\\in f(a)\\rbrace.$$\nIt is easy to see that $R_{g\\circ f}=R_g\\circ R_f$, where the $\\circ$ on\nthe right hand side denotes relational composition.\n\nFor a subset $S\\subseteq A$, if we define\n$f(S)=\\lbrace b\\in B\\mid b\\in f(s)\\mbox{ for some }s\\in S\\rbrace$, then\n$f:A\\Rightarrow B$ is surjective iff $f(A)=B$, and functional\ncomposition has a simplified and familiar form:\n$$(g\\circ f)(a)=g(f(a)).$$\n\nA bijective multivalued function $i:A\\Rightarrow A$ is said to be an\n*identity* (on $A$) if $a\\in i(a)$ for all $a\\in A$ (equivalently, $R_f$\nis a reflexive relation). Certainly, the function $id_A$ on $A$, taking\n$a$ into itself (or equivalently, $\\lbrace a\\rbrace$), is an identity.\nHowever, given $A$, there may be more than one identity on it:\n$f:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(n)=\\lbrace n,n+1\\rbrace$ is an\nidentity that is not $id_{\\mathbb{Z}}$. An absolute identity on $A$ is\nnecessarily $id_A$.\n\nSuppose $i:A\\Rightarrow A$, we have the following equivalent\ncharacterizations of an identity:\n\n1.  $i$ is an identity on $A$\n\n2.  $f(x)\\subseteq (f\\circ i)(x)$ for every $f:A\\Rightarrow B$ and every\n    $x\\in A$\n\n3.  $g(y)\\subseteq (i\\circ g)(y)$ for all $g:C\\Rightarrow A$ and\n    $y\\in C$\n\nTo see this, first assume $i$ is an identity on $A$. Then $x\\in i(x)$,\nso that $f(x)\\subseteq f(i(x))$. Conversely,\n$id_A(x)\\subseteq (id_A\\circ i)(x)$ implies that\n$\\lbrace x\\rbrace \\subseteq id_A(i(x)) = \\lbrace y\\mid y\\in i(x)\\rbrace$,\nso that $x\\in i(x)$. This proved the equivalence of (1) and (2). The\nequivalence of (1) and (3) are established similarly.\n\nA multivalued function $g:B\\Rightarrow A$ is said to be an *inverse* of\n$f:A\\Rightarrow B$ if $f\\circ g$ is an identity on $B$ and $g\\circ f$ is\nan identity on $A$. If $f$ possesses an inverse, it must be surjective.\nGiven that $f:A\\Rightarrow B$ is surjective, the multivalued function\n$f^{-1}: B\\Rightarrow A$ defined by\n$f^{-1}(b)=\\lbrace a\\in A\\mid b\\in f(a)\\rbrace$ is an inverse of $f$.\nLike identities, inverses are not unique.\n\n**Remark**. More generally, one defines a *multivalued partial function*\n(or *partial multivalued function*) $f$ from $A$ to $B$, as a\nmultivalued function from a subset of $A$ to $B$. The same notation\n$f:A\\Rightarrow B$ is used to mean that $f$ is a multivalued partial\nfunction from $A$ to $B$. A multivalued partial function\n$f:A\\Rightarrow B$ can be equivalently characterized, either as a\nfunction $f':A \\to P(B)$, where $f'(a)$ is undefined iff\n$f'(a)=\\varnothing$, or simply as a relation $R_f$ from $A$ to $B$,\nwhere $a R_f b$ iff $f(a)$ is defined and $b\\in f(a)$. Every partial\nfunction $f:A\\to B$ has an associated multivalued partial function\n$f^*:A\\Rightarrow B$, so that $f^*(a)$ is defined and is equal to\n$\\lbrace b\\rbrace$ iff $f(a)$ is and $f(a)=b$.",
