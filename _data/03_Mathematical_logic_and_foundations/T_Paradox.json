  "definition": "A [*paradox*]{} is an assertion that is apparently self-contradictory,\nthough based on a valid deduction from acceptable premises.\n\nParadoxes typically lead to a reevaluation of the axioms of mathematics.\nafter axioms are assumed so that the paradox is averted, the statement\nis still usually referred to as a paradox.\n\nOccasionally, one may refer to a surprising result as a paradox. Such is\nthe case in the birthday paradox, which is not apparently\nself-contradictory.\n\nExamples of paradoxes include:\n\n-   Banach-Tarski paradox\n\n-   binary tree paradox\n\n-   -   Burali-Forti paradox\n\n-   Cantor\u2019s paradox\n\n-   Hausdorff paradox\n\n-   Russell\u2019s paradox\n\n-   Simpson\u2019s paradox\n\n-   Zeno\u2019s paradox",
