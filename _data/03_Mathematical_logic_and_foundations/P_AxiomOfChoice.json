  "statement": "The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory are often accepted as a basis\nfor an axiomatic set theory. On the other hand, the *axiom of choice* is\nsomewhat controversial, and it is currently segregated from the ZF\nsystem of set theory axioms. When the axiom of choice is combined with\nthe ZF axioms, the whole axiom system is called \u201cZFC\u201d (for\n\u201cZermelo-Fraenkel with Choice\u201d).\n\nLet $C$ be a set of nonempty sets. Then there exists a function\n$$f\\colon C\\to \\bigcup_{S\\in C} S$$ such that $f(x) \\in x$ for all\n$x \\in C$.\n\nThe function $f$ is sometimes called a *choice function* on $C$.\n\nFor finite sets $C$, a choice function can be constructed without\nappealing to the axiom of choice. In particular, if $C=\\varnothing$,\nthen the choice function is clear: it is the empty set! It is only for\ninfinite (and usually uncountable) sets $C$ that the existence of a\nchoice function becomes an issue. Here one can see why it is not\nconsidered \u201cobvious\u201d and always taken for an axiom by everyone: one\nreally cannot imagine any process which makes uncountably many\nselections without also imagining some rule for making the selections.\nGiven such a rule, the axiom of choice is not needed. Thus, objects that\nare proved to exist using the axiom of choice cannot generally be\ndescribed by any kind of systematic rule, for if they could it would not\nbe necessary to their construction.\n\nLet us consider a couple of examples. Imagine that there are infinitely\nmany pairs of shoes (each consisting of one left shoe and one right\nshoe). Let $\\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of all pairs of shoes. In this\nscenario, it can be verified that the function\n$\\displaystyle f \\colon \\mathcal{P} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{P}$ defined by\n$f(P)=\\text{ the left shoe of }P$ is a choice function. Similarly,\nimagine that there are infinitely many pairs of socks. Let $\\mathcal{S}$\ndenote the set of all pairs of socks. In this scenario, one cannot\nassume that a function\n$\\displaystyle g \\colon \\mathcal{S} \\to \\bigcup \\mathcal{S}$ exists\nwithout appealing to the axiom of choice (or something equivalent to\nit). Note that this scenario cannot be resolved in the same manner as\nthe previous scenario because most people do not a \u201cleft sock\u201d and a\n\u201cright sock\u201d.\n\nStrange objects that can be constructed using the axiom of choice\ninclude non-measurable sets (leading to the and ), and Hamel bases for\nany vector space. A Hamel basis may not seem strange, but try to imagine\na set $S$ of continuous functions such that every continuous function\ncan be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of *finitely many*\nelements of $S$. Since in fact the existence of a basis for every vector\nspace is equivalent to the axiom of choice, it is almost guaranteed that\nno such set $S$ can ever be described. It is for this reason that some\nmathematicians dislike the axiom of choice.\n\nOn the other hand, many very useful facts can be proven using the axiom\nof choice. For example, the fact that every vector space has a basis,\nevery ring with identity element $1\\neq 0$ has a maximal ideal and many\nother algebraic theorems which are difficult or impossible to prove\nwithout using the axiom of choice.\n\nIn pure set theory, the axiom of choice is only relevant where most\npeople\u2019s intuition more or less breaks down, when dealing with\nhierarchies of uncountable infinities.\n\nThe relevance of the axiom of choice to various of mathematics has led\nto a detailed study of its truth. It turns out that if the\nZermelo-Fraenkel axioms are consistent, then they remain consistent upon\nadding the axiom of choice. But they also remain consistent upon adding\nthe negation of the axiom of choice (see\u00a0[@G] and\u00a0[@C]).\n\nSome mathematicians have suggested an axiom that would result in all\nsubsets of the real numbers being measurable; this would of course imply\nthe negation of the axiom of choice.\n\nThere are many alternative formulations of the axiom of choice, although\nit is not always trivial to prove . These include:\n\n-   The generalized Cartesian product of a non-empty family of sets is\n    non-empty iff every set is non-empty. Due to this equivalence the\n    axiom of choice is sometimes called the *multiplicative axiom* ().\n\n-   Every relation $R$ is a union of functions with the same domain as\n    $R$ ().\n\n-   Every ring with identity element $1\\neq 0$ has a maximal ideal ().\n\n-   Every surjection is a ().\n\n-   Every tree has a branch.\n\n-   Every vector space has a basis (for AC implying existence of vector\n    bases, see , and its converse, proved by Andreas Blass in 1984, ).\n\n-   Given any two sets, there exists an injection from one to another\n    ().\n\n-   Hausdorff\u2019s maximum principle ().\n\n-   .\n\n-   Kuratowski\u2019s lemma ().\n\n-   Tukey\u2019s lemma ().\n\n-   Tychonoff\u2019s theorem (for AC implying Tychonoff, see , and its\n    converse ).\n\n-   Zermelo\u2019s postulate ().\n\n-   Zermelo\u2019s well-ordering theorem ().\n\n-   Zorn\u2019s lemma ().\n\nFigure\u00a0\\[fig:implications\\] shows how these equivalences are proven on\nPlanetMath.\n\n\\[fig:implications\\]\n\n![Structure of the equivalence proofs on PlanetMath.
