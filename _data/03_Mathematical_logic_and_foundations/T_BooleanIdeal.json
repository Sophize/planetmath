  "definition": "Let $A$ be a Boolean algebra and $B$ a subset of $A$. The following are\nequivalent:\n\n1.  If $A$ is interpreted as a Boolean ring, $B$ is a ring ideal.\n\n2.  If $A$ is interpreted as a Boolean lattice, $B$ is a lattice ideal.\n\nBefore proving this equivalence, we want to mention that a Boolean ring\nis equivalent to a Boolean lattice, and a more commonly used terminology\nis a Boolean algebra, which is also valid, as it is an algebra over the\nring of integers. The standard way of characterizing the ring structure\nfrom the lattice structure is by defining\n$a+b:=(a'\\wedge b)\\vee (a\\wedge b')$ (called the symmetric difference)\nand $a\\cdot b=a\\wedge b$. From this, we can \u201csolve\u201d for $\\vee $ in terms\nof $+$ and $\\cdot$: $a\\vee b=a+b+a\\cdot b$.\n\nFirst, suppose $B$ is an ideal of the \u201cring\u201d $A$. If $a,b\\in B$, then\n$a\\vee b= a+b+a\\cdot b\\in B$. Suppose now that $a\\in B$ and $c\\in A$\nwith $c\\le a$. Then $c=c\\wedge a=c\\cdot a \\in B$ as well. So $B$ is a\nlattice ideal of $A$.\n\nNext, suppose $B$ is an ideal of the \u201clattice\u201d $A$. If $a,b\\in B$, then\nboth $a'\\wedge b$ and $a\\wedge b'$ are in $B$ since the first one is\nless than or equal to $b$ and the second less than or equal to $a$, so\ntheir join is in $B$ as well, this means that\n$a-b=a+b=(a'\\wedge b)\\vee (a\\wedge b')\\in B$. Furthermore, if $a\\in B$\nand $c\\in A$, then $c\\cdot a=c\\wedge a\\le a\\in B$ as well. As a result,\n$B$ is a ring ideal of $A$.\n\nA subset of a Boolean algebra satisfying the two equivalent conditions\nabove is called a *Boolean ideal*, or an *ideal* for short. A *prime\nBoolean ideal* is a prime lattice ideal, and a *maximal Boolean ideal*\nis a maximal lattice ideal. Again, these notions and their ring\ntheoretic counterparts match exactly. In fact, one can say more about\nthese ideals in the case of a Boolean algebra: prime ideals are\nprecisely the maximal ideals. If $A$ is a Boolean ring, and $M$ is a\nmaximal ideal of $A$, then $A/M$ is isomorphic to $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$.\n\n**Remark**. The dual notion of a Boolean ideal is a *Boolean filter*, or\na filter for short. A Boolean filter is just a lattice filter of the\nBoolean algebra when considered as a lattice. To see the connection\nbetween a Boolean ideal and a Boolean lattice, let us define, for any\nsubset $S$ of a Boolean algebra $A$, the set\n$S':=\\lbrace a'\\mid a\\in S\\rbrace$. It is easy to see that $S''=S$. Now,\nif $I$ is an ideal, then $I'$ is a filter. Conversely, if $F$ is a\nfilter, $F'$ is a ideal. In fact, given any Boolean algebra, there is a\nGalois connection $$I\\mapsto I',\\qquad F\\mapsto F'$$ between the set of\nBoolean ideals and the set of Boolean filters in $A$. In addition, $I$\nis prime iff $I'$ is. As a result, a filter is prime iff it is an\nultrafilter (maximal filter).",
