  "definition": "The *union* of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set which contains all\n$x \\in A$ and all $x \\in B$, denoted $A \\cup B$. In the Venn diagram\nbelow, $A\\cup B$ is the entire area shaded in blue.\n\n(0,0)(6,4) (2,2)[2]{} (4,2)[2]{} (1,2)[$A$]{} (5,2)[$B$]{} (-1,0)[$.$]{}\n(7,4)[$.$]{}\n\nWe can extend this to any (finite or infinite) family $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$,\nwriting $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$ for the union of this family. Formally,\nfor a family $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$ of sets:\n$$x \\in \\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i\\; \\Leftrightarrow \\;\\bigvee_{i\\in I}\\, (x\\in A_i)$$\nAlternatively, and equivalently,\n$$x \\in \\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i\\; \\Leftrightarrow \\;\\exists i\\in I\\text{ such that } x\\in A_i$$\nThis characterization makes it much clearer that if $I$ is itself the\nempty set (that is, if we are taking the union of an empty family), then\nthe union is empty; that is, $$\\bigcup_{i\\in\\emptyset}A_i=\\emptyset$$\n\nOften elements of sets are taken from some universe $U$ of elements\nunder consideration (for example, the real numbers ${\\mathbb{R}}$, or\nliving things on the planet, or words in a particular book). When this\nis the case, it is meaningful to discuss the *complement* of a set: if\n$A$ is a set of elements from some universe $U$, then the complement of\n$A$ is the set $$A^C = U\\backslash A= \\{x\\in U{\\ \\mid\\ }x\\notin A\\}$$\n\nFrom an axiomatic point of view, the existence of the union is\nguaranteed by the axiom of union.\n\nNote that the sets $A_i$ may be, but need not be, disjoint. Unions\nsatisfy some basic properties that are obvious from the definitions:\n\n-   Idempotency: $A \\cup A = A$\n\n-   $A \\cup A^C = U$ where $U$ is the *universe* of $A$\n\n-   Commutativity: $A \\cup B = B \\cup A$\n\n-   Associativity: $(A \\cup B) \\cup C = A \\cup (B \\cup C)$\n\nHere are some examples of set unions: $$\\begin{gathered}\n\\{1,2\\}\\cup\\{3,4\\} = \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\\\\n\\{blue, green\\}\\cup\\emptyset = \\{blue, green\\}\\\\\n\\{x\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\ \\mid\\ x{\\geqslant}1\\}\\cup\\{x\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\ \\mid\\ x{\\leqslant}-1\\} = \\{x\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\ \\mid\\ x\\neq 0\\}\\\\\n\\{1,2\\}\\cup\\{1,4\\} = \\{1,2,4\\}\\\\\n\\{x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}\\ \\mid\\ x{\\geqslant}2\\}\\cup\\{x\\in{\\mathbb{R}}\\ \\mid\\ x{\\leqslant}2\\} = {\\mathbb{R}}\\\\\n\\bigcup_{\\substack{n\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\n>0}} \\left\\{\\frac{p}{n}\\,\\mid\\,p\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\right\\} = {\\mathbb{Q}}\\end{gathered}$$\nThe first three of these are the union of disjoint sets, while the\nlatter three are not - in those cases, the sets overlap each other.",
