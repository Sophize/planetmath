  "statement": "In this entry, we show that the deduction theorem below holds for\nintuitionistic propositional logic. We use the axiom system provided in\n.\n\nIf $\\Delta, A \\vdash_i B$, where $\\Delta$ is a set of wff\u2019s of the\nintuitionistic propositional logic, then $\\Delta \\vdash_i A\\to B$.\n\nThe proof is very similar to that of the classical propositional logic,\ngiven , in that it uses induction on the length of the deduction of $B$.\nIn fact, the proof is simpler as only two axiom schemas are used:\n$A\\to (B\\to A)$ and $(A\\to B) \\to ((A\\to (B\\to C)) \\to (A\\to C))$.\n\nThere are two main cases to consider:\n\n-   If $B$ is an axiom or in $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$, then\n    $$B, B\\to (A\\to B), A\\to B$$ is a deduction of $A\\to B$ from\n    $\\Delta$, where $A\\to B$ is obtained by modus ponens applied to $B$\n    and the axiom $B\\to (A\\to B)$. So $\\Delta \\vdash_i A\\to B$.\n\n-   Now, suppose that $$A_1,\\ldots, A_n$$ is a deduction of $B$ from\n    $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A \\rbrace$, with $B$ obtained from earlier\n    formulas by modus ponens.\n\n    We use induction on the length $n$ of deduction of $B$. Note that\n    $n\\ge 3$. If $n=3$, then $C$ and $C\\to B$ are either axioms or in\n    $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$.\n\n    -   If $C$ is $A$, then $C\\to B$ is either an axiom or in $\\Delta$.\n        So $\\Delta \\vdash_i A\\to B$.\n\n    -   If $C\\to B$ is $A$, then $C$ is either an axiom or in $\\Delta$.\n        Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n        &&\\mathcal{E}_0, C\\to (A\\to C), C, A\\to C, (A\\to C)\\to ((A\\to (C\\to B))\\to (A\\to B)), \\\\\n        &&(A\\to (C\\to B))\\to (A\\to B), A\\to B\\end{aligned}$$ is a\n        deduction of $A\\to B$ from $\\Delta$, where $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is a\n        deduction of the theorem $A\\to A$, followed by an axiom\n        instance, then $C$, then the result of modus ponens, then an\n        axiom instance, and finally two applications of modus ponens.\n        Note the second to the last formula is just\n        $(A\\to A)\\to (A\\to B)$.\n\n    -   If $C$ and $C\\to B$ are axioms or in $\\Delta$, then\n        $\\Delta \\vdash_i A\\to B$ based on the deduction\n        $C, C\\to B, B, B\\to (A\\to B), A\\to B$.\n\n    Next, assume there is a deduction $\\mathcal{E}$ of $B$ of length\n    $n>3$. So one of the earlier formulas is $A_k \\to B$, and a\n    subsequence of $\\mathcal{E}$ is a deduction of $A_k \\to B$, which\n    has length less than $n$, and therefore by induction,\n    $\\Delta \\vdash_i A \\to (A_k \\to B)$. Likewise, a subsequence of\n    $\\mathcal{E}$ is a deduction of $A_k$, so by induction,\n    $\\Delta \\vdash_i A \\to A_k$. With the axiom instance\n    $(A\\to A_k)\\to ((A\\to (A_k\\to B))\\to (A\\to B))$, and two\n    applications of modus ponens, we get $\\Delta\\vdash_i A\\to B$ as\n    required.\n\nIn both cases, $\\Delta \\vdash_i A\\to B$, and the proof is complete.\n\n**Remark** The deduction theorem can be used to prove the deduction\ntheorem for the first and second order intuitionistic predicate logic.\n\n[7]{} J.
