  "definition": "A *cylindric algebra* is a quadruple $(B,V,\\exists,d)$, where $B$ is a\nBoolean algebra, $V$ is a set whose elements we call *variables*,\n$\\exists$ and $d$ are functions\n$$\\exists:V\\to B^B\\qquad \\mbox{ and } \\qquad d:V\\times V\\to B$$ such\nthat\n\n1.  $(B,\\exists x)$ is a monadic algebra for each $x\\in V$,\n\n2.  $\\exists x\\circ \\exists y = \\exists y\\circ \\exists x$ for any\n    $x,y\\in V$,\n\n3.  $d_{xx}=1$ for all $x\\in V$,\n\n4.  for any $x,y\\in V$ with $x\\ne y$, and any $a \\in B$, we have the\n    equality\n    $$\\exists x(a\\wedge d_{xy})\\wedge \\exists x\\big(a'\\wedge d_{xy}\\big)=0$$\n\n5.  for any $x,y,z\\in V$ with $x\\ne y$ and $x\\ne z$, we have the\n    equality $$\\exists x (d_{xy}\\wedge d_{xz})=d_{yz}.$$\n\nwhere $\\exists x$ and $d_{xy}$ are the abbreviations for $\\exists(x)$\nand $d(x,y)$ respectively.\n\nBasically, the first two conditions say that the $(B,V,\\exists)$ portion\nof the cylindric algebra is very similar to a quantifier algebra, except\nthe domain is no longer the subsets of $V$, but the elements of $V$\ninstead. The function $d$ is the algebraic abstraction of equality.\nCondition 3 says that $x=x$ is always true, condition 4 says that the\nproposition $a$ and its complement $a'$, where any occurrences of the\nvariable $x$ are replaced by the variable $y$, distinct from $x$, is\nalways false, while condition 5 says $y=z$ iff there is an $x$ such that\n$x=y$ and $x=z$.\n\nBelow are some elementary properties of $d$:\n\n-   (symmetric property) $d_{xy}=d_{yx}$\n\n-   (transitive property) $d_{xy}\\wedge d_{yz}\\le d_{xz}$\n\n-   $\\exists x(d_{xy})=1$\n\n-   $\\exists x(d_{yz})=d_{yz}$ provided that\n    $x\\notin \\lbrace y,z\\rbrace$\n\n-   if $x\\ne y$, then\n\n    1.  $\\exists x(d_{xy}\\wedge a')= (\\exists x(d_{xy}\\wedge a))'$,\n\n    2.  $d_{xy} \\wedge a =d_{xy} \\wedge \\exists x(a\\wedge d_{xy})$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n1.  The *dimension* of a cylindric algebra $(B,V,\\exists,d)$ is the\n    cardinality of $V$.\n\n2.  From the definition above, a cylindric algebra is a two-sorted\n    structure, with $B$ and $V$ as the two distinct universes. However,\n    it is often useful to view a cylindric algebra as a one-sorted\n    structure. The way to do this is to dispense with $V$ and identify\n    each $\\exists x$ as a unary operator on $B$, and each $d_{xy}$ as a\n    constant in $B$. As a result, the cylindric algebra\n    $(B,V,\\exists,d)$ becomes a Boolean algebra with possibly infinitely\n    many operators: $$(B,\\exists x,d_{xy})_{x,y\\in V}.$$\n\n3.  Let $L$ be a the language of a first order logic, and $S$ a set of\n    sentences in $L$. Define $\\equiv$ on $L$ so that\n    $$\\varphi \\equiv \\psi\\quad \\mbox{ iff }\\quad S \\vdash (\\varphi\\leftrightarrow \\psi).$$\n    Then $\\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on $L$. For each formula\n    $\\varphi\\in L$, let $[\\varphi]$ be the equivalence class containing\n    $\\varphi$. Let $V$ be a countably infinite set of variables\n    available to $L$. Now, define operations\n    $\\vee,\\wedge,',\\exists x,d_{xy}$ as follows:\n\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    [\\varphi] \\vee [\\psi] &:=& [\\varphi \\vee \\psi], \\\\ \n    \\left[ \\varphi \\right] \\wedge [\\psi] &:=& [\\varphi \\wedge \\psi], \\\\ \n    \\left[ \\varphi \\right]' &:=& [\\neg \\varphi], \\\\ \n    0 &:=& [\\neg  x=x], \\\\ \n    1 &:=& [x=x], \\\\\n    \\exists x[\\varphi] &:=& [\\exists x \\varphi], \\\\\n    d_{xy} &:=& [x=y].\\end{aligned}$$\n\n    Then it can be shown that $(L/\\equiv, V,\\exists,d)$ is a cylindric\n    algebra. Thus a cylindric algebra can be thought of as an\n    \u201calgebraization\u201d of first order logic (with equality), much the same\n    way as a Boolean algebra (Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra) as the\n    algebraic counterpart of propositional logic.\n\n[8]{} P.
