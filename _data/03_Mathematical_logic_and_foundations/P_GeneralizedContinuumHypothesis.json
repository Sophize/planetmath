  "statement": "The *generalized continuum hypothesis* states that for any infinite\ncardinal $\\lambda$ there is no cardinal $\\kappa$ such that\n$\\lambda <\\kappa <2^{\\lambda}$.\n\nAn equivalent condition is that $\\aleph_{\\alpha+1}=2^{\\aleph_\\alpha}$\nfor every ordinal $\\alpha$. Another equivalent condition is that\n$\\aleph_\\alpha=\\beth_\\alpha$ for every ordinal $\\alpha$.\n\nLike the continuum hypothesis, the generalized continuum hypothesis is\nknown to be independent of the axioms of ZFC.",
