  "definition": "Let $L$ be a many-sorted language and $S$ the set of sorts. A\n*many-sorted structure* $M$ for $L$, or simply an $L$-structure consists\nof the following:\n\n1.  for each sort $s\\in S$, a non-empty set $A_s$,\n\n2.  for each function symbol $f$ of sort type $(s_1,\\ldots, s_n)$:\n\n    -   if $n>1$, a function\n        $f_M: A_{s_1}\\times \\cdots \\times A_{s_{n-1}} \\to A_{s_n}$\n\n    -   if $n=1$ (constant symbol), an element $f_M\\in A_{s_1}$\n\n3.  for each relation symbol $r$ of sort type $(s_1,\\ldots,s_n)$, a\n    relation (or subset)\n    $$r_M\\subseteq A_{s_1}\\times \\cdots \\times A_{s_n}.$$\n\nA *many-sorted algebra* is a many-sorted structure without any\nrelations.\n\n**Remark**. A many-sorted structure is a special case of a more general\nconcept called a *many-sorted interpretation*, which consists all of\nitems 1-3 above, as well as the following:\n\n-   an element $x_M\\in A_s$ for each variable $x$ of sort $s$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  A left module over a ring can be thought of as a two-sorted algebra\n    (say, with sorts $\\lbrace s_1,s_2\\rbrace$), for there are\n\n    -   there are two non-empty sets $M$ (corresponding to sort $s_1$)\n        and $R$ (corresponding to sort $s_2$), where\n\n    -   $M$ has the structure of an abelian group (equipped with three\n        operations: $0,-,+$, corresponding to function symbols of sort\n        types $(s_1), (s_1,s_1)$, and $(s_1,s_1,s_1)$)\n\n    -   $R$ has the structure of a ring (equipped with at least four\n        operations: $0,-,+,\\times$, corresponding to function symbols of\n        sort types $(s_2), (s_2,s_2)$ and $(s_2,s_2,s_2)$ for $+$ and\n        $\\times$, and possibly a fifth operation $1$ of sort type\n        $(s_2)$)\n\n    -   a function $\\cdot: R\\times M\\to M$, which corresponds to a\n        function symbol of sort type $(s_2,s_1,s_1)$. Clearly, $\\cdot$\n        is the scalar multiplication on the module $M$.\n\n    For a right module over a ring, one merely replaces the sort type of\n    the last function symbol by the sort type $(s_1,s_2,s_1)$.\n\n2.  A deterministic semiautomaton $A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta)$ is a two-sorted\n    algebra, where\n\n    -   $S$ and $\\Sigma$ are non-empty sets, corresponding to sorts,\n        say, $s_1$ and $s_2$,\n\n    -   $\\delta: S\\times \\Sigma \\to S$ is a function corresponding to a\n        function symbol of sort type $(s_1,s_2,s_1)$.\n\n3.  A deterministic automaton $B=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,\\sigma,F)$ is a\n    two-sorted structure, where\n\n    -   $(S,\\Sigma,\\delta)$ is a semiautomaton discussed earlier,\n\n    -   $\\sigma$ is a constant corresponding to a nullary function\n        symbol of sort type $(s_1)$,\n\n    -   $F$ is a unary relation corresponding to a relation symbol of\n        sort type $(s_1)$.\n\n    Because $F$ is a relation, $B$ is not an algebra.\n\n4.  A complete sequential machine $M=(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\delta,\\lambda)$\n    is a three-sorted algebra, where\n\n    -   $(S,\\Sigma,\\delta)$ is a semiautomaton discussed earlier,\n\n    -   $\\Delta$ is a non-empty sets, corresponding to sort, say, $s_3$,\n\n    -   $\\lambda: S\\times \\Sigma \\to \\Delta$ is a function corresponding\n        to a function symbol of sort type $(s_1,s_2,s_3)$.\n\n[9]{} J.
