  "definition": "A *permutation* of a finite set $\\{a_1,\\,a_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,a_n\\}$ is an\narrangement of its elements. For example, if $S=\\{A,\\,B,\\,C\\}$ then\n$A B C$, $C A B$ , $C B A$ are three different permutations of $S$.\n\nThe number of permutations of a set with $n$ elements is $n!$ (see the\nrule of product).\n\nA permutation can also be seen as a bijective function of a set into\nitself. For example, the permutation $A B C \\mapsto C A B$ could be seen\na function $f:\\{A,B,C\\} \\to \\{A,B,C\\}$ that assigns:\n$$f(A)=C,\\qquad f(B)=A,\\qquad f(C)=B.$$\n\nIn fact, every bijection of a set into itself gives a permutation, and\nany permutation gives rise to a bijective function.\n\nTherefore, we can say that there are $n!$ bijective functions from a set\nwith $n$ elements into itself.\n\nUsing the function approach, it can be proved that any permutation can\nbe expressed as a composition of disjoint cycles and also as composition\nof (not necessarily disjoint) transpositions.\n\nMoreover, if $\\sigma=\\tau_1\\tau_2\\cdots\\tau_m=\\rho_1\\rho_2\\cdots\\rho_n$\nare two factorization of a permutation $\\sigma$ into transpositions,\nthen $m$ and $n$ must be both even or both odd. So we can label\npermutations as *even* or *odd* depending on the number of\ntranspositions for any decomposition.\n\nPermutations (as functions) form in general a non-abelian group with\nfunction composition as binary operation called *symmetric group of\norder $n$*. The subset of even permutations becomes a subgroup called\nthe alternating group of order $n$.",
