  "statement": "The signature of a permutation is well-defined, as proved in the\narticle. This note characterizes odd permutations.\n\nA permutation $\\sigma$ is odd if and only if the number of even-order\ncycles in its cycle type is odd.\n\nThus, for example, this theorem asserts that $(1~2~3)$ is an even\npermutation, since it has zero even-order cycles, while $(1~2)(3~4~5)$\nis odd, since it has precisely one even-order cycle.\n\nNote that the function taking a permutation to its signature is a\nhomomorphism from $S_n\\to {\\mathbb{Z}}/2{\\mathbb{Z}}$, and we thus get\nthe following multiplication rules for even and odd permutations:\n\n  --------------------------------------------------\n   (even)$\\cdot$(even)\u00a0=\u00a0(odd)$\\cdot$(odd)\u00a0=\u00a0(even)\n   (even)$\\cdot$(odd)\u00a0=\u00a0(odd)$\\cdot$(even)\u00a0=\u00a0(odd)\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that we can represent a single cycle as a product of\ntranspositions:\n$$(a_1~a_2~a_3~\\ldots~a_k)=(a_1~a_k)(a_1~a_{k-1})\\ldots(a_1~2)$$ and\nthat therefore an even-length cycle is odd (since it is equivalent to an\nodd number of transpositions) while an odd-length cycle is even.\n\nBy the multiplication rules above, then, a given permutation is odd if\nand only if the product of the signs of its cycles is odd, which happens\nif and only if there are an odd number of cycles whose sign is odd,\nwhich happens if and only if there are an odd number of cycles of even\nlength.",
