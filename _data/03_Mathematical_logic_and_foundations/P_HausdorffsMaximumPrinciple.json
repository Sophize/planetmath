Then there exists a\nmaximal totally ordered subset of $X$.\n\nThe Hausdorff\u2019s maximum principle is one of the many theorems equivalent\nto the . The below proof uses Zorn\u2019s lemma, which is also equivalent to\nthe .\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all totally ordered subsets of $X$. $S$ is not\nempty, since the empty set is an element of $S$. Partial order $S$ by\ninclusion. Let $\\tau$ be a chain (of elements) in $S$. Being each\ntotally ordered, the union of all these elements of $\\tau$ is again a\ntotally ordered subset of $X$, and hence an element of $S$, as is easily\nverified. This shows that $S$, ordered by inclusion, is inductive. The\nresult now follows from Zorn\u2019s lemma.",
