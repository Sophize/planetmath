By the well-ordering\nprinciple, $\\displaystyle \\bigcup_{S \\in C} S$ is well-ordered under\nsome relation $<$. Since each $S$ is a nonempty subset of\n$\\displaystyle \\bigcup_{S \\in C} S$, each $S$ has a least member $m_S$\nwith respect to the relation $<$.\n\nDefine $\\displaystyle f \\colon C \\to \\bigcup_{S \\in C} S$ by $f(S)=m_S$.\nThen $f$ is a choice function. Hence, the axiom of choice holds.",
