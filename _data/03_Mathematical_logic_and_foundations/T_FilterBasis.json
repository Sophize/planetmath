  "definition": "A *filter subbasis* for a set $S$ is a collection of subsets of $S$\nwhich has the finite intersection property.\n\nA *filter basis* $B$ for a set $S$ is a non-empty collection of subsets\nof $S$ which does not contain the empty set such that, for every\n$u \\in B$ and every $v \\in B$, there exists a $w \\in B$ such that\n$w \\subset u \\cap v$.\n\nGiven a filter basis $B$ for a set $S$, the set of all supersets of\nelements of $B$ forms a filter on the set $S$. This filter is known as\nthe filter generated by the basis.\n\nGiven a filter subbasis $B$ for a set $S$, the set of all supersets of\nfinite intersections of elements of $B$ is a filter. This filter is\nknown as the filter generated by the subbasis.\n\nTwo filter bases are said to be *equivalent* if they generate the same\nfilter. Likewise, two filter subbases are said to be equivalent if they\ngenerate the same filter.\n\n**Note:** Not every author requires that filters do not contain the\nempty set. Because every filter is a filter basis then accordingly some\nauthors allow that a filter base can contain the empty set.",
