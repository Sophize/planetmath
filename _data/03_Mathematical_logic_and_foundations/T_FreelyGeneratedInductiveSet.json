  "definition": "In the parent entry, we see that an *inductive set* is a set that is\nclosed under the successor operator. If $A$ is a non-empty inductive\nset, then $\\mathbb{N}$ can be embedded in $A$.\n\nMore generally, fix a non-empty set $U$ and a set $F$ of finitary\noperations on $U$. A set $A\\subseteq U$ is said to be *inductive* (with\nrespect to $F$) if $A$ is closed under each $f\\in F$. This means, for\nexample, if $f$ is a binary operation on $U$ and if $x,y\\in A$, then\n$f(x,y)\\in A$. $A$ is said to be inductive over $X$ if $X\\subseteq A$.\nThe intersection of inductive sets is clearly inductive. Given a set\n$X\\subseteq U$, the intersection of all inductive sets over $X$ is said\nto be the *inductive closure* of $X$. The inductive closure of $X$ is\nwritten $\\langle X\\rangle$. We also say that $X$ generates\n$\\langle X\\rangle$.\n\nAnother way of defining $\\langle X\\rangle$ is as follows: start with\n$$X_0 :=X.$$ Next, we \u201cinductively\u201d define each $X_{i+1}$ from $X_i$, so\nthat\n$$X_{i+1}:= X_i \\cup \\bigcup \\lbrace f(X_i^n)\\mid f\\in F, f \\mbox{ is } n\\mbox{-ary}\\rbrace.$$\nFinally, we set $$\\overline{X}: = \\bigcup_{i=0}^{\\infty} X_i.$$ It is\nnot hard to see that $\\overline{X}=\\langle X\\rangle$.\n\nBy definition, $X\\subseteq \\overline{X}$. Suppose $f\\in F$ is $n$-ary,\nand $a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\in \\overline{X}$, then each $a_i \\in X_{m(i)}$.\nTake the maximum $m$ of the integers $m(i)$, then $a_i \\in X_m$ for each\n$i$. Therefore $f(a_1,\\ldots, a_n) \\in X_{m+1} \\subseteq \\overline{X}$.\nThis shows that $\\overline{X}$ is inductive over $X$, so\n$\\langle X\\rangle \\subseteq \\overline{X}$, since $\\langle X\\rangle$ is\nminimal. On the other hand, suppose $a\\in \\overline{X}$. We prove by\ninduction that $a\\in \\langle X\\rangle$. If $a\\in X$, this is clear.\nSuppose now that $X_i\\subseteq \\langle X\\rangle$, and $a\\in X_{i+1}$. If\n$a\\in X_i$, then we are done. Suppose now $a\\in X_{i+1}-X_i$. Then there\nis some $n$-ary operation $f\\in F$, such that $a=f(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$,\nwhere each $a_j\\in X_i$. So $a_j\\in \\langle X\\rangle$ by hypothesis.\nSince $\\langle X\\rangle$ is inductive,\n$f(a_1,\\ldots, a_n) \\in \\langle X\\rangle$, and hence\n$a\\in \\langle X\\rangle$ as well. This shows that $X_{i+1}\\subseteq A$,\nand consequently $\\overline{X} \\subseteq \\langle X\\rangle$.\n\nThe inductive set $A$ is said to be freely generated by $X$ (with\nrespect to $F$), if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.  $A=\\langle X\\rangle$,\n\n2.  for each $n$-ary $f\\in F$, the restriction of $f$ to $A^n$ is\n    one-to-one;\n\n3.  for each $n$-ary $f\\in F$, $f(A^n)\\cap X=\\varnothing$;\n\n4.  if $f,g\\in F$ are $n,m$-ary, then $f(A^n)\\cap g(A^m)=\\varnothing$.\n\nFor example, the set $\\overline{V}$ of well-formed formulas (wffs) in\nthe classical proposition logic is inductive over the set of $V$\npropositional variables with respect to the logical connectives (say,\n$\\neg$ and $\\vee$) provided. In fact, by unique readability of wffs,\n$\\overline{V}$ is freely generated over $V$. We may readily interpret\nthe above \u201cfreeness\u201d conditions as follows:\n\n1.  $\\overline{V}$ is generated by $V$,\n\n2.  for distinct wffs $p,q$, the wffs $\\neg p$ and $\\neg q$ are\n    distinct; for distinct pairs $(p,q)$ and $(r,s)$ of wffs, $p\\vee q$\n    and $r\\vee s$ are distinct also\n\n3.  for no wffs $p,q$ are $\\neg p$ and $p\\vee q$ propositional variables\n\n4.  for wffs $p,q$, the wffs $\\neg p$ and $p\\vee q$ are never the same\n\nA characterization of free generation is the following:\n\nThe following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $A$ is freely generated by $X$ (with respect to $F$)\n\n2.  if $V\\ne \\varnothing$ is a set, and $G$ is a set of finitary\n    operations on $V$ such that there is a function $\\phi: F\\to G$\n    taking every $n$-ary $f\\in F$ to an $n$-ary $\\phi(f)\\in G$, then\n    every function $h: X \\to B$ has a unique extension\n    $\\overline{h}: A\\to B$ such that\n    $$\\overline{h}(f(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))=\\phi(f)(\\overline{h}(a_1),\\ldots, \\overline{h}(a_n)),$$\n    where $f$ is an $n$-ary operation in $F$, and $a_i\\in A$.\n\n[7]{} H.
