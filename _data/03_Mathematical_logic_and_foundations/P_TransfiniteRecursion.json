  "statement": "Transfinite recursion, roughly speaking, is a statement about the\nability to define a function recursively using transfinite induction. In\nits most general and intuitive form, it says\n\nLet $G$ be a (class) function on $V$, the class of all sets. Then there\nexists a unique (class) function $F$ on $\\mathbf{On}$, the class of\nordinals, such that $$F(\\alpha)=G(F|\\alpha)$$ where $F|\\alpha$ is the\nfunction whose domain is\n$\\operatorname{seg}(\\alpha):=\\lbrace \\beta\\mid \\beta<\\alpha\\rbrace$ and\nwhose values coincide with $F$ on every\n$\\beta\\in \\operatorname{seg}(\\alpha)$. In other words, $F|\\alpha$ is the\nrestriction of $F$ to $\\operatorname{\\alpha}$.\n\nNotice that the theorem above is not provable in ZF set theory, as $G$\nand $F$ are both classes, not sets. In order to prove this statement,\none way of getting around this difficulty is to convert both $G$ and $F$\ninto formulas, and modify the statement, as follows:\n\nLet $\\varphi(x,y)$ be a formula such that\n$$\\forall x\\exists y \\forall z (\\varphi(x,z)\\leftrightarrow z=y).$$\nThink of $G=\\lbrace (x,y)\\mid \\varphi(x,y)\\rbrace$. Then there is a\nunique formula $\\psi(\\alpha,z)$ (think of $F$ as\n$\\lbrace (\\alpha,z)\\mid \\psi(\\alpha,z)\\rbrace$) such that the following\ntwo sentences are derivable using ZF axioms:\n\n1.  $\\forall x\\exists y \\forall z \\big(\\mathbf{On}(x)\\wedge (\\psi(x,z)\\leftrightarrow z=y) \\big),$\n    where $\\mathbf{On}(x)$ means \u201c$x$ is an ordinal\u201d,\n\n2.  $\\forall x\\forall y \\Big(\\mathbf{On}(x)\\wedge \\big(\\psi(x,y)\\leftrightarrow \\exists f (A\\wedge B \\wedge C \\wedge D) \\big) \\Big)$,\n    where\n\n    -   $A$ is the formula \u201c$f$ is a function\u201d,\n\n    -   $B$ is the formula \u201c$\\operatorname{dom}(f)=x$\u201d,\n\n    -   $C$ is the formula\n        $\\forall z \\big(z\\in x \\wedge \\varphi(f|z,f(z))\\big)$, and\n\n    -   $D$ is the formula $\\varphi(f,y)$.\n\nA stronger form of the transfinite recursion theorem says:\n\nLet $\\varphi(x,y)$ be any formula (in the language of set theory). Then\nthe following is a theorem: assume that $\\varphi$ satisfies property\nthat, for every $x$, there is a unique $y$ such that $\\varphi(x,y)$. If\n$A$ be a well-ordered set (well-ordered by $\\le$), then there is a\nunique function $f$ defined on $A$ such that\n$$\\varphi(f|\\operatorname{seg}(s),f(s))$$ for every $s\\in A$. Here,\n$\\operatorname{seg}(s):=\\lbrace t\\in A\\mid t<s\\rbrace$, the initial\nsegment of $s$ in $A$.\n\nThe above theorem is actually a collection of theorems, or known as a\ntheorem schema, where each theorem corresponds to a formula. The other\ndifference between this and the previous theorem is that this theorem is\nprovable in ZF, because the domain of the function $f$ is now a set.",
