  "definition": "Let $\\Sigma$ be a signature. The *first order language*\n$\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$ on $\\Sigma$ contains the following:\n\n1.  the set $S(\\Sigma)$ of *symbols* of $\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$,\n    which is the disjoint union of the following sets:\n\n    1.  $\\Sigma$ (the *non-logical symbols*),\n\n    2.  a countably infinite set $V$ of variables,\n\n    3.  the set of logical symbols\n        $\\lbrace {\\wedge}, {\\vee}, \\neg, {\\Rightarrow}, {\\Leftrightarrow}, \\forall, \\exists \\rbrace$,\n\n    4.  the singleton consisting of the equality symbol\n        $\\lbrace =\\rbrace$, and\n\n    5.  the set of parentheses (left and right) $\\lbrace (, )\\rbrace$;\n\n2.  the set $T(\\Sigma)$ of *terms* of $\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$, which\n    is built inductively from $S(\\Sigma)$, as follows:\n\n    1.  Any variable $v\\in V$ is a term;\n\n    2.  Any constant symbol in $\\Sigma$ is a term;\n\n    3.  If $f$ is an $n$-ary function symbol in $\\Sigma$, and\n        $t_1,...,t_n$ are terms, then $f(t_1,...,t_n)$ is a term.\n\n3.  the set $F(\\Sigma)$ of *formulas* of $\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$,\n    which is built inductively from $T(\\Sigma)$, as follows:\n\n    1.  If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $(t_1=t_2)$ is a formula;\n\n    2.  If $R$ is an $n$-ary relation symbol and $t_1,...,t_n$ are\n        terms, then $(R(t_1,...,t_n))$ is a formula;\n\n    3.  If $\\varphi$ is a formula, then so is $(\\neg\\varphi)$;\n\n    4.  If $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are formulas, then so is\n        $(\\varphi{\\vee}\\psi)$;\n\n    5.  If $\\varphi$ is a formula, and $x$ is a variable, then\n        $(\\exists x(\\varphi))$ is a formula.\n\nIn other words, $T(\\Sigma)$ and $F(\\Sigma)$ are the smallest sets, among\nall sets satisfying the conditions given for terms and formulas,\nrespectively.\n\nFormulas in 3(a) and 3(b), which do not contain any logical connectives,\nare called the *atomic formulas*.\n\nFor example, in the first order language of partially ordered rings,\nexpressions such as $$0,\\quad x^2,\\quad\\mbox{ and } \\quad y+zx$$ are\nterms, while\n$$(x=xy),\\quad (x+y \\le yz),\\quad \\mbox{ and }\\quad (\\exists x ((x\\le 0) {\\vee}(0\\le x)))$$\nare formulas, and the first two of which are atomic.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  Generally, one omits parentheses in formulas, when there is no\n    ambiguity. For example, a formula $(\\varphi)$ can be simply written\n    $\\varphi$. As such, the parentheses are also called the *auxiliary\n    symbols*.\n\n2.  The other logical symbols are obtained in the following way :\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\varphi\\varphi{\\wedge}\\psi&{\\overset{\\operatorname{def}}{:=}}\\neg(\\neg\\varphi{\\vee}\\neg\\psi)&\\qquad\n    \\varphi{\\Rightarrow}\\psi&{\\overset{\\operatorname{def}}{:=}}\\neg\\varphi{\\vee}\\psi\\\\\n    \\varphi{\\Leftrightarrow}\\psi&{\\overset{\\operatorname{def}}{:=}}(\\varphi{\\Rightarrow}\\psi){\\wedge}(\\psi{\\Rightarrow}\\varphi)&\\qquad\n    \\forall x(\\varphi)&{\\overset{\\operatorname{def}}{:=}}\\neg(\\exists x(\\neg\\varphi))\\end{aligned}$$\n    where $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are formulas. All logical symbols are\n    used when building formulas.\n\n3.  In the literature, it is a common practice to write\n    $\\Sigma_{\\omega \\omega}$ for $\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$. The first\n    subscript means that every formula in $\\operatorname{FO}(\\Sigma)$\n    contains a finite number of $\\vee$\u2019s (less than $\\omega$), while the\n    second subscript signifies that every formula has a finite number of\n    $\\exists$\u2019s. In general, $\\Sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}$ denotes a language\n    built from $\\Sigma$ such that, in any given formula, the number of\n    occurrences of $\\vee$ is less than $\\alpha$ and the number of\n    occurrences of $\\exists$ is less than $\\beta$. When the number of\n    occurrences of $\\vee$ (or $\\exists$) in a formula is not limited, we\n    use the symbol $\\infty$ in place of $\\alpha$ (or $\\beta$). Clearly,\n    if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not $\\omega$, we get a language that is\n    not first-order.\n\n### First Order Languages as Formal Languages {#first-order-languages-as-formal-languages .unnumbered}\n\nIf the signature $\\Sigma$ and the set $V$ of variables are countable,\nthen $S(\\Sigma), T(\\Sigma)$, and $F(\\Sigma)$ can be viewed as formal\nlanguages over a certain (finite) alphabet $\\Gamma$. The set $\\Gamma$\nshould include all of the logical connectives, the equality symbol, and\nthe parentheses, as well as the following symbols $$R,F,V,I,\\#,$$ where\nthey are used to form words for relation, formula, and variable symbols.\nMore precisely,\n\n-   $VI^n\\#$ stands for the variable $v_n$,\n\n-   $RI^n\\#I^m\\#$ stands for the $m$-th relation symbol of arity $n$,\n    and\n\n-   $FI^n\\#I^m\\#$ stands for the $m$-th function symbol of arity $n$,\n\nwhere $m,n\\ge 0$ are integers. The symbol $\\#$ is used as a delimiter or\nseparator. Note that the constant symbols are then words of the form\n$F\\#I^m\\#$. It can shown that $S(\\Sigma), T(\\Sigma)$ and $F(\\Sigma)$ are\ncontext-free over $\\Gamma$, and in fact unambiguous.\n\n[99]{} W.\u00a0Hodges, [*A Shorter Model Theory*]{}, Cambridge University\nPress, (1997).
