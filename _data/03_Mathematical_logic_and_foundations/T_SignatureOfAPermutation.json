  "definition": "Let $X$ be a finite set, and let $G$ be the group of permutations of $X$\n(see permutation group). There exists a unique homomorphism $\\chi$ from\n$G$ to the multiplicative group $\\{-1,1\\}$ such that $\\chi(t)=-1$ for\nany transposition (loc. sit.) $t\\in G$. The value $\\chi(g)$, for any\n$g\\in G$, is called the *signature* or *sign* of the permutation $g$. If\n$\\chi(g)=1$, $g$ is said to be of even *parity*; if $\\chi(g)=-1$, $g$ is\nsaid to be of odd parity.\n\n**Proposition:** If $X$ is totally ordered by a relation $<$, then for\nall $g\\in G$, $$\\chi(g)=(-1)^{k(g)}$$ where $k(g)$ is the number of\npairs $(x,y)\\in X\\times X$ such that $x<y$ and $g(x)>g(y)$. (Such a pair\nis sometimes called an *inversion* of the permutation $g$.)\n\n**Proof:** This is clear if $g$ is the identity map $X\\to X$. If $g$ is\nany other permutation, then for some *consecutive* $a,b\\in X$ we have\n$a<b$ and $g(a)>g(b)$. Let $h\\in G$ be the transposition of $a$ and $b$.\nWe have $$\\begin{aligned}\nk(g \\circ h)&=&k(g)-1 \\\\\n\\chi(g \\circ h)&=&-\\chi(g)\\end{aligned}$$ and the proposition follows by\ninduction on $k(g)$.",
