  "statement": "G\u00f6del\u2019s first and second incompleteness theorems are perhaps the most\ncelebrated results in mathematical logic. The basic idea behind G\u00f6del\u2019s\nproofs is that by the device of G\u00f6del numbering, one can formulate\nproperties of theories and sentences as arithmetical properties of the\ncorresponding G\u00f6del numbers, thus allowing 1st order arithmetic to speak\nof its own consistency, provability of some sentence and so forth.\n\nThe original result G\u00f6del proved in his classic paper [*On Formally\nUndecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related\nSystems*]{} can be stated as\n\nNo theory $\\mathbf{T}$ axiomatisable in the type system of PM (i.e., in\nRussell\u2019s theory of types) which contains Peano-arithmetic and is\n$\\omega$-consistent proves all true theorems of arithmetic (and no false\nones).\n\nStated this way, the theorem is an obvious corollary of Tarski\u2019s result\non the undefinability of truth. This can be seen as follows. Consider a\nG\u00f6del numbering G, which assigns to each formula $\\phi$ its G\u00f6del number\n$^\\lceil\\phi^\\rceil$. The set of G\u00f6del numbers of all true sentences of\narithmetic is $\\{^\\lceil\\phi^\\rceil \\mid \\mathbb{N}\\models \\phi\\}$, and\nby Tarski\u2019s result it isn\u2019t definable by any arithmetic formula. But\nassume there\u2019s a theory $T$ an axiomatisation $\\mathbf{Ax}_T$ of which\nis definable in arithmetic and which proves all true statements of\narithmetic. But now $\\exists P(P$ is a proof of $x$ from\n$\\mathbf{Ax}_T)$ defines the set of (G\u00f6del numbers of) true sentences of\narithmetic, which contradicts Tarski\u2019s result.\n\nThe proof given above is highly non-constructive. A much stronger\nversion can actually be extracted from G\u00f6del\u2019s paper, namely that\n\nThere is a primitive recursive function $\\Godel$, such that if $T$ is a\ntheory with a p.r. axiomatisation $\\alpha$, and if all primitive\nrecursive functions are representable in $T$ then\n$\\mathbb{N}\\models\\Godel(\\alpha)$ but $T \\not\\vdash\\Godel(\\alpha)$\n\nThis second form of the theorem is the one usually proved, although the\ntheorem is usually stated in a form for which the nonconstructive proof\nbased on Tarski\u2019s result would suffice. The proof for this stronger\nversion is based on a similar idea as Tarski\u2019s result.\n\nConsider the formula $\\exists P (P$ is a proof of $x$ from $\\alpha)$,\nwhich defines a predicate $$\\Prov_\\alpha(x)$$ which represents\nprovability from $\\alpha$. Assume we have numerated the open formulae\nwith one variable in a sequence $B_i$, so that every open formula\noccurs. Consider now the sentence $\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(B_x)$, which defines\nthe non-provability from $\\alpha$ predicate. Now, since\n$\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(B_x)$ is an open formula with one variable, it must be\n$B_k$ for some $k$. Thus we can consider the closed sentence $B_k(k)$.\nThis sentence is equivalent to\n$\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(subst(^\\lceil\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(x)^\\rceil),k))$, but\nsince $subst(^\\lceil\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(x)^\\rceil),k)$ is just $B_k(k)$, it\n\u201casserts its own unprovability\u201d.\n\nSince all the steps we took to get the undecided but true sentence\n$subst(^\\lceil\\neg\\Prov_\\alpha(x)^\\rceil),k)$ is just $B_k(k)$ were very\nsimple mechanic manipulations of G\u00f6del numbers guaranteed to terminate\nin bounded time, we have in fact produced the p.r. function $\\Godel$\nrequired by the statement of the theorem.\n\nThe first version of the proof can be used to show that also many\nnon-axiomatisable theories are incomplete. For example, consider $PA$ +\nall true $\\Pi_1$ sentences. Since $\\Pi_1$ truth is definable at\n$\\Pi_2$-level, this theory is definable in arithmetic by a formula\n$\\alpha$. However, it\u2019s not complete, since otherwise $\\exists p (p$ is\na proof of $x$ from $\\alpha)$ would be the set of true sentences of\narithmetic. This can be extended to show that no arithmetically\ndefinable theory with sufficient expressive power is complete.\n\nThe second version of G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem suggests a\nnatural way to extend theories to stronger theories which are exactly as\nsound as the original theories. This sort of process has been studied by\nTuring, Feferman, Fenstad and others under the names of ordinal logics\nand transfinite recursive progressions of arithmetical theories.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem concerns what a theory can prove\nabout its own provability predicate, in particular whether it can prove\nthat no contradiction is provable. The answer under very general\nsettings is that a theory can\u2019t prove that it is consistent, without\nactually being inconsistent.\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem is best presented by means of a\nprovability logic. Consider an arithmetic theory $T$ which is p.r.\naxiomatised by $\\alpha$. We extend the language this theory is expressed\nin with a new sentence forming operator $\\Box$, so that any sentence in\nparentheses prefixed by $\\Box$ is a sentence. Thus for example,\n$\\Box(0=1)$ is a formula. Intuitively, we want $\\Box(\\phi)$ to express\nthe provability of $\\phi$ from $\\alpha$. Thus the semantics of our new\nlanguage is exactly the same as that of the original language, with the\nadditional rule that $\\Box(\\phi)$ is true if and only if\n$\\alpha \\vdash \\phi$. There is a slight difficulty here; $\\phi$ might\nitself contain boxed expressions, and we haven\u2019t yet provided any\nsemantics for these. The answer is simple, whenever a boxed expression\n$\\Box(\\psi)$ occurs within the scope of another box, we replace it with\nthe arithmetical statement $\\Prov_\\alpha(\\psi)$. Thus for example the\ntruth of $\\Box(\\Box(0=1))$ is equivalent to\n$\\alpha \\vdash \\Prov_\\alpha(^\\lceil 0=1 ^\\rceil)$. Assuming that\n$\\alpha$ is strong enough to prove all true instances of\n$\\Prov_\\alpha(^\\lceil\\phi^\\rceil)$ we can in fact interprete the whole\nof the new boxed language by the translation. This is what we shall do,\nso formally $\\alpha \\vdash \\phi$ (where $\\phi$ might contain boxed\nsentences) is taken to mean $\\alpha \\vdash \\phi*$ where $\\phi*$ is\nobtained by replacing the boxed expressions with arithmetical formulae\nas above.\n\nThere are a number of restrictions we must impose on $\\alpha$ (and thus\non $\\Box$, the meaning of which is determined by $\\alpha$). These are\nknown as Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions and they are as follows\n\n-   if $\\alpha \\vdash \\phi$ then $\\alpha \\vdash \\Box(\\phi)$\n\n-   $\\alpha \\vdash \\Box(\\phi) \\rightarrow \\Box\\Box(\\phi)$\n\n-   $\\alpha \\vdash \\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\Box\\phi\\rightarrow\\Box\\psi)$\n\nA statement $Cons$ asserts the consistency of $\\alpha$ if its equivalent\nto $\\neg\\Box(0=1)$. G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem shows that\nthere is a sentence $B_k(k)$ for which the following is true\n$\\neg\\Box(0=1) \\rightarrow \\Diamond(B_k(k)) \\wedge \\Diamond(\\neg(B_k(k))$,\nwhere $\\Diamond$ is the dual of $\\Box$, i.e.\n$\\Diamond(\\phi) \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\Box(\\neg\\phi)$. A careful analysis\nreveals that this is [*provable*]{} in any $\\alpha$ which satisfied the\nderivability conditions, i.e.\n$\\alpha \\vdash \\neg\\Box(0=1) \\rightarrow \\Diamond(B_k(k)) \\wedge \\Diamond(\\neg(B_k(k))$.\nAssume now that $\\alpha$ can prove $\\neg\\Box(0=1)$, i.e. that $\\alpha$\ncan prove its own consistency. Then $\\alpha$ can prove\n$\\Diamond(B_k(k)) \\wedge \\Diamond(\\neg(B_k(k))$. But this means that\n$\\alpha$ can prove $B_k(k)$! Thus $\\alpha$ is inconsistent.",
