  "definition": "The *Burali-Forti* paradox demonstrates that the class of all ordinals\nis not a set. If there were a set of all ordinals, $Ord$, then it would\nfollow that $Ord$ was itself an ordinal, and therefore that\n$Ord\\in Ord$. if sets in general are allowed to contain themselves,\nordinals cannot since they are defined so that $\\in$ is well founded\nover them.\n\nThis paradox is similar to both Russell\u2019s paradox and Cantor\u2019s paradox,\nalthough it predates both. All of these paradoxes prove that a certain\nobject is \u201ctoo large\u201d to be a set.",
