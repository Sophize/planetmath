  "definition": "A *perfect ruler* of length $n$ is a ruler with a subset of the integer\nmarkings $\\{0,a_2,\\ldots,n\\}\\subset\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ that appear on a\nregular ruler. The defining criterion of this subset is that there\nexists an $m$ such that any positive integer $k\\leq m$ can be expresses\nuniquely as a difference $k=a_i-a_j$ for some $i,j$. This is referred to\nas an *$m$-perfect ruler*.\n\nA 4-perfect ruler of length $7$ is given by $\\{0,1,3,7\\}$. To verify\nthis, we need to show that every number $1,2,\\ldots,4$ can be expressed\nas a difference of two numbers in the above set:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n1&=1-0\\\\\n2&=3-1\\\\\n3&=3-0\\\\\n4&=7-3\\\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAn optimal perfect ruler is one where for a fixed value of $n$ the value\nof $a_n$ is minimized.",
