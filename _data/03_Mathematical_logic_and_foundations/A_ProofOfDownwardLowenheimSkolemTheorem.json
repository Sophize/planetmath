  "argumentText": "We present here a proof of the Downward Lowenheim Skolem Theorem. The\nidea is to construct a submodel that meets the requirements of the DLS\nTheorem: we take $K$ and close it under a procedure of choosing\nappropriate witnesses for the existential formulas satisfied by\n$\\mathcal{A}$. Choosing the appropriate witnesses is done with the help\nof the so-called *Skolem functions* and thus rests upon the *choice\nfunction*.\n\n*Proof*: First of all we introduce a usefull tool for the proof. Lemma:\n(*Tarski\u2019s Lemma*) If $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are $L$-structures\nwith the domain of $\\mathcal{A}$ being a subset of the domain of\n$\\mathcal{B}$ then $\\mathcal{A}$ is an elementary substructure of\n$\\mathcal{B}$ if for every $L$-formula $\\phi(\\emph{x},y)$ with $a \\in A$\nand $b \\in B$, we have $\\mathcal{B}\\models \\phi(a,b)$ &lt;-&gt; For some\n$a' \\in A$ we have $\\mathcal{A}\\models \\phi(a,a')$\n\n*Proof*. Let\u2019s supposes the biconditionnal holds, then we need to show\nthat $\\mathcal{A}$ is a substructure of $\\mathcal{B}$. This means that\nwe need to show that every formula that is true in $\\mathcal{A}$ is true\nin $\\mathcal{B}$. The proof is straighforward with an induction on the\ncomplexity of formulas (connectives, negation, quantifiers).\n\nNow, fix a point $p \\in {dom}(\\mathcal{A})$. For each $L$-formula\n$\\phi(\\emph{x},y)$, define the *Skolem function* of $\\phi$,\n$g_\\phi : A^n \\to A$ (with $A={dom}(\\mathcal{A})$) by:\n\n$p \\in A^n \\to$ some $p' \\in A$ such that\n$\\mathcal{A}\\models \\phi(p,p')$ if such a $p'$ exists and $p$ otherwise.\nThe set of *Skolem functions* has a cardinality equal to that of $L$.\n\nThe purpose here is to construct a model $\\mathcal{B}$ whose domain $B$\nis closed under the skolem functions. This means that the domain of\n$\\mathcal{A}$ contains all the witnesses we\u2019ve appropriately choosen. If\nwe take an existential formula $\\exists y \\phi(\\emph{x},y)$ and\n$b \\in B^k$ and if we apply the Skolem function to $b$ we will have a\nwitness for $\\exists x \\phi(\\emph{b},x)$. In other words, this means\nthat\n$\\mathcal{A}\\models \\exists x \\phi(b,x) \\to \\mathcal{A}\\models \\phi(b,g_\\phi(b))$.\nBy construction $g_\\phi(b)$ is in $B$ and thus $\\mathcal{B}$ meets the\nrequirements of Tarski\u2019s Lemma. We can find an elementary substructure\nof $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nLet\u2019s take $K$ of above and set $K_0:=K$ and $K_{i+1}$ is the set of the\n$g_\\phi(p), p \\in K_i \\wedge  g_\\phi$ (with $g_\\phi$ a Skolem function).\nLet $B:= \\bigcup K_i$. Then $B$ is closed under Skolem functions. And we\nhave $|K|\\leq \\omega .|L|+|K|= |L|+|K|$. This comes from the fact that\n$|L|+|K_i|=|\\emph{SF}|+|K_i|= \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N} }|(SF)_k|+|K_i|= \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N} }|(SF)_k|*|K_i|$\nbut we have $|K_{i+1}| \\leq \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N} }|(SF)_k|*|K_i|$. We\nneed now to provide interpretations of relations, predicates, functions\nand constants so it can fit $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe have because $B$ is closed under $L$-terms and for an $L$-function\nsymbol $f$, the Skolem function of the $L$-formula $f(x)=y$ takes the\nvalue $f^\\mathcal{A}(p)$ at p:\n\nfor any n-ary relation symbol $P$:\n$P^\\mathcal{B}=P^\\mathcal{A}\\bigcap B^n$\n\nfor an m-ary function symbol $f$ and $p \\in B^m , p' \\in B$ we have\n$f^\\mathcal{A}(p)=p'$ &lt;-&gt; $f^\\mathcal{B}(p)=p'$.\n\nfor a constant symbol $c$, we have $c^\\mathcal{A}=c^\\mathcal{B}$ We have\nconstructed a substructure $\\mathcal{B}$ of $\\mathcal{A}$.",
