  "statement": "In this short article we will provide an example where one\u2019s intuition\ncan be faulty, and that strict formalization is always needed when one\ndoes mathematics in order to avoid possible hidden intuitive\ninconsistencies. A striking example is the erroneous but intuitively\nobvious thesis: \u201cif a formal system $F$ proves that there exists proof\nof formula $A$ in $F$, then $F$ has proved $A$\u201d or slightly differently\nversion is this one: \u201cit must be always provable in all formal systems\nthat from formula saying that there exists proof of $A$ in $F$, indeed\nfollows $A$ in $F$\u201d. Both formulations of this naive intuition\nconcerning basics of math logic severely fail. We will show that a\nconsistent $F$ cannot prove for arbitrary formula $\\phi_{n}$ that from\nformula that asserts \u201cexists proof of $\\phi_{n}$\u201d follows $\\phi_{n}$.\nThis is a major ingredient of a theorem proved by L\u00f6b in 1955.\n\n> L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem: If $F\\vdash\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$,\n> where $x$ is the G\u00f6del number of the proof of the formula with G\u00f6del\n> number $n$, and $\\check{n}$ is the numeral of the G\u00f6del number of the\n> formula $\\phi_{n}$, then $F\\vdash\\phi_{n}$.\n\nThe proof presented here follows Karlis Podnieks (2006):\n\nSuppose $F\\vdash\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$. Let $F^{*}$\nbe the new proof system that is equal to $F$ plus the new axiom\n$\\neg\\phi_{n}$. By modus tollens\n$F^{*}\\vdash\\neg\\phi_{n}\\Rightarrow\\neg\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})$. Since\n$F^{*}$ has as axiom $\\neg\\phi_{n}$ by modus ponens\n$F^{*}\\vdash\\neg\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})$. In this case $F^{*}$ proves\nthat $\\phi_{n}$ is not provable in $F$ (and also that $F$ is\nconsistent). This however leads to proof that $F^{*}$ is also consistent\nbecause it contains only $F$ and $\\neg\\phi_{n}$, and we already know\nboth that $F$ is consistent and that $F$ does not prove $\\phi_{n}$. Thus\n$F^{*}$ proves its own consistency. According to G\u00f6del\u2019s second theorem\nhowever $F^{*}$ cannot prove its own consistency unless being\ninconsistent. Therefore $F+\\neg\\phi_{n}$ must be always inconsistent\ntheory, and we conclude that $F\\vdash\\phi_{n}$.\n\nNow see that the intuitive notion that\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$ is not provable within\narbitrary formal system. If the formal system is inconsistent obviously\nit proves every formula so the above intuitive notion will be provable.\nIf however $F$ is consistent it cannot prove\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$ for arbitrary formula,\nbecause *if it could*, for formally refutable formula\n$\\phi_{k}\\equiv[0=1]$, $F$ *could* prove by modus tollens\n$\\neg\\phi_{k}\\Rightarrow\\neg\\exists xP(x,\\check{k})$, and since\n$\\neg\\phi_{k}$ is formally provable formula, then the formal system\n*could* infer its own consistency, or said in ordinary language: from\n$\\neg\\phi_{k}$, $F$ *could* have proved \u201cthere exists at least one\nunprovable formula in $F$\u201d, which is impossible according to G\u00f6del\u2019s\nsecond theorem.\n\n> Corollary: If $F$ is consistent formal system then $F$ cannot prove\n> for arbitrary formula $\\phi_{n}$ that from formula that asserts\n> \u201cexists proof of $\\phi_{n}$\u201d follows $\\phi_{n}$.\n\nThe proof of the corollary is straigthforward either directly from L\u00f6b\u2019s\ntheorem, or by independent reasoning using the fact that consistent $F$\ncannot prove $\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{k}$ for refutable\n$\\phi_{k}$.\n\nThe relationship between the direct text of L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem in the proof\nprovided by Podnieks, and the corrolary is this one: if the system $F$\nis consistent, it might be able to prove\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$ for provable formulas\n$\\phi_{n}$, because the provability of $\\phi_{n}$ taken together with\nthe consistency of $F$ ensure unprovability of $\\neg \\phi_{n}$ and hence\nmodus tollens reversed formula of\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{n}$ cannot be used for $F$ to\nprove its own consistency. Also taking into account the second G\u00f6del\ntheorem it is easy to be seen that $F$ should not be able to prove\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{k}$ for disprovable (refutable)\nformulas $\\phi_{k}$, a result that alone is sufficient to prove the\ncorollary. Still the corollary is a weaker result than L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem,\nbecause the corrolary does not give us clue whether\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{p}$ is provable for undecidable\nformulas $\\phi_{p}$. This was indeed the \u201copen problem\u201d proposed by Leon\n. The L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem answers this question, and shows that it is\nimpossible for consistent $F$ to prove\n$\\exists xP(x,\\check{n})\\Rightarrow\\phi_{p}$ for undecidable formulas\n$\\phi_{p}$. Therefore summarized, L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem says that for refutable\nor undecidable formulas $\\phi$, the intuition \u201cif \u201cexists proof of\n$\\phi$\u201d then $\\phi$\u201d is erroneous.\n\n> Modus tollens inversed L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem: If $F$ is consistent formal\n> system then $F$ cannot prove for any unprovable formula $\\phi_{k}$\n> that from formula that asserts \u201cexists proof of $\\phi_{k}$\u201d follows\n> $\\phi_{k}$.\n\nComparing the above theorem with the corrolary shows small but\nsignificant difference, which makes it stronger proposition (note: in\nconsistent formal system $F$ unprovable formulas are all refutable\n(disprovable) formulas, as well as all undecidable formulas).\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.
