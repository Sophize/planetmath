  "definition": "$\\clubsuit_S$ is a combinatoric principle weaker than $\\Diamond_S$. It\nstates that, for $S$ stationary in $\\kappa$, there is a sequence\n$\\langle A_\\alpha\\rangle_{\\alpha\\in S}$ such that\n$A_\\alpha\\subseteq\\alpha$ and $\\operatorname{sup}(A_\\alpha)=\\alpha$ and\nwith the property that for each unbounded subset $T\\subseteq\\kappa$\nthere is some $A_\\alpha\\subseteq X$.\n\nAny sequence satisfying $\\Diamond_S$ can be adjusted so that\n$\\operatorname{sup}(A_\\alpha)=\\alpha$, so this is indeed a weakened form\nof $\\Diamond_S$.\n\nAny such sequence actually contains a stationary set of $\\alpha$ such\nthat $A_\\alpha\\subseteq T$ for each $T$: given any club $C$ and any\nunbounded $T$, construct a $\\kappa$ sequence, $C^*$ and $T^*$, from the\nelements of each, such that the $\\alpha$-th member of $C^*$ is greater\nthan the $\\alpha$-th member of $T^*$, which is in turn greater than any\nearlier member of $C^*$. Since both sets are unbounded, this\nconstruction is possible, and $T^*$ is a subset of $T$ still unbounded\nin $\\kappa$. So there is some $\\alpha$ such that\n$A_\\alpha\\subseteq T^*$, and since\n$\\operatorname{sup}(A_\\alpha)=\\alpha$, $\\alpha$ is also the limit of a\nsubsequence of $C^*$ and therefore an element of $C$.",
