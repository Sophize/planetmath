  "definition": "A **propositional calculus** is a formal system whose expressions\nrepresent formal objects known as *propositions* and whose distinguished\nrelations among expressions represent existing relations among\npropositions. Many different propositional calculi represent what is\nrecognizably the same subject matter of propositions and their\nrelations, which more generic subject matter is conveniently described\nas *propositional logic*. For the purposes of mathematical discussion,\nand especially in computational applications, it is sufficient to\nidentify a proposition with a boolean-valued function, that is, a\nmapping of the type $X \\to \\mathbb{B}$, where $X$ is some set and\n$\\mathbb{B} = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$.\n\nAs a general consideration, a calculus is a formal system that consists\nof a set of syntactic expressions, a distinguished subset of these\nexpressions, plus a set of transformation rules that define a binary\nrelation on the space of expressions.\n\nWhen the expressions are interpreted for mathematical purposes, the\ntransformation rules are typically intended to preserve some type of\nsemantic equivalence relation among the expressions. In particular, when\nthe expressions are intepreted as a logical system, the semantic\nequivalence is typically intended to be logical equivalence. In this\nsetting, the transformation rules can be used to derive logically\nequivalent expressions from any given expression. These derivations\ninclude as special cases (1) the problem of *simplifying* expressions\nand (2) the problem of deciding whether a given expression is equivalent\nto an expression in the distinguished subset, typically interpreted as\nthe subset of logical *axioms*.\n\nThe formal language component of a propositional calculus consists of\n(1) a set of primitive symbols, variously referred to as *atomic\nformulas*, *placeholders*, *proposition letters*, or *variables*, and\n(2) a set of operator symbols, variously interpreted as *logical\noperators* or *logical connectives*. A *well-formed formula* (*wff*) is\nany atomic formula or any formula that can be built up from atomic\nformulas by means of operator symbols.\n\nThe following outlines a standard propositional calculus. Many different\nformulations exist which are all more or less equivalent but differ in\n(1) their language, that is, the particular collection of primitive\nsymbols and operator symbols, (2) the set of axioms, or distingushed\nformulas, and (3) the set of transformation rules that are available.\n\nAbstraction and application\n===========================\n\nAlthough it is possible to construct an abstract formal calculus that\nhas no immediate practical use and next to nothing in the way of obvious\napplications, the very name *calculus* indicates that this species of\nformal system owes its origin to the utility of its prototypical members\nin practical calculation. Generally speaking, any mathematical calculus\nis designed with the intention of representing a given domain of formal\nobjects, and typically with the aim of facilitating the computations and\ninferences that need to be carried out in this representation. Thus some\nidea of the intended denotation, the formal objects that the formulas of\nthe calculus are intended to denote, is given in advance of developing\nthe calculus itself.\n\nViewed over the course of its historical development, a formal calculus\nfor any given subject matter normally arises through a process of\ngradual abstraction, stepwise refinement, and trial-and-error synthesis\nfrom the array of informal notational systems that inform prior use,\neach of which covers the object domain only in part or from a particular\nangle.\n\nGeneric description of a propositional calculus\n===============================================\n\nA **propositional calculus** is a formal system\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(A, \\Omega, Z, I)$, whose formulas are\nconstructed in the following manner:\n\n-   The *alpha set* $A$ is a finite set of elements called *proposition\n    symbols* or *propositional variables*. Syntactically speaking, these\n    are the most basic elements of the formal language $\\mathcal{L}$,\n    otherwise referred to as *atomic formulas* or *terminal elements*.\n    In the examples to follow the elements of $A$ are typically the\n    letters $p$, $q$, $r$, and so on.\n\n-   The *omega set* $\\Omega$ is a finite set of elements called\n    *operator symbols* or *logical connectives*. The set $\\Omega$ is\n    partitioned into disjoint subsets as follows:\n\n    > $\\Omega = \\bigcup_{j=0}^m \\Omega_j$.\n\n    In this partition, $\\Omega_j$ is the set of operator symbols of\n    arity $j$.\n\n    In the more familiar propositional calculi, $\\Omega$ is typically\n    partitioned as follows:\n\n    > $\\Omega_1 = \\{ \\lnot \\}$,\n    >\n    > $\\Omega_2 \\subseteq \\{ \\land, \\lor, \\Rightarrow, \\Leftrightarrow \\}$.\n\n    A frequently adopted option treats the constant logical values as\n    operators of arity zero, thus:\n\n    > $\\Omega_0 = \\{0,\\ 1 \\}$.\n\n    Some writers use the tilde $(\\text{\\char126})$ instead of $(\\lnot)$\n    and some use the ampersand $(\\&)$ instead of $(\\land)$. Notation\n    varies even more for the set of logical values, with symbols like\n    $\\{ \\mathrm{false}, \\mathrm{true} \\}$,\n    $\\{ \\mathrm{F}, \\mathrm{T} \\}$, $\\{ 0, 1 \\}$, and $\\{ \\bot, \\top \\}$\n    all being seen in various contexts.\n\n-   Depending on the precise formal grammar or the grammar formalism\n    that is being used, syntactic auxiliaries like the left parenthesis,\n    $``(\"$, and the right parentheses, $``)\"$, may be necessary to\n    complete the construction of formulas.\n\n-   The *zeta set* $Z$ is a finite set of *transformation rules* that\n    are called *inference rules* when they acquire logical applications.\n\n-   The *iota set* $I$ is a finite set of *initial points* that are\n    called *axioms* when they receive logical interpretations.\n\nExample 1. Simple axiom system\n==============================\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L}_1 = \\mathcal{L}(A, \\Omega, Z, I)$, where\n$A, \\Omega, Z, I$ are defined as follows:\n\nThe alpha set $A$ is a finite set of symbols that is large enough to\nsupply the needs of a given discussion, for example:\n\n> $A = \\{ p, q, r, s, t, u \\}$.\n\nThe omega set $\\Omega$ is a set of two symbols\n$\\{ \\lnot\\ , \\Rightarrow \\}$ that partitions as follows:\n\n> $\\Omega_1 = \\{ \\lnot \\}$,\n>\n> $\\Omega_2 = \\{ \\Rightarrow \\}$.\n\nUnder the usual interpretation of these symbols, this choice amounts to\nadopting negation and implication as the primitive operations of the\npropositional calculus $\\mathcal{L}_1$.\n\nOf the three connectives for conjunction $(\\land)$, disjunction\n$(\\lor)$, and implication $(\\Rightarrow)$, one can be taken as primitive\nand the other two can be defined in terms of it and negation $(\\lnot)$.\nThe equivalence $(\\Leftrightarrow)$ is defined in terms of conjunction\nand implication, with $p \\Leftrightarrow q$ defined as\n$(p \\Rightarrow q) \\land (q \\Rightarrow p)$.\n\nThe zeta set $Z$ formalizes the inference rule known as **:\n\n> From $p$, $(p \\Rightarrow q)$, infer $q$.\n\nThe iota set $I$ abstracts an axiom system for propositional logic that\nwas discovered by Jan ukasiewicz:\n\n> $p \\Rightarrow (q \\Rightarrow p)$\n>\n> $(p \\Rightarrow (q \\Rightarrow r)) \\Rightarrow ((p \\Rightarrow q) \\Rightarrow (p \\Rightarrow r))$\n>\n> $(\\lnot p \\Rightarrow \\lnot q) \\Rightarrow (q \\Rightarrow p)$\n\nWe have the following auxiliary definitions:\n\n> $p \\lor q\\ :=\\ \\lnot p \\Rightarrow q$.\n>\n> $p \\land q\\ :=\\ \\lnot(p \\Rightarrow \\lnot q)$.\n\nExample 2. Natural deduction system\n===================================\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L}_2 = \\mathcal{L}(A, \\Omega, Z, I)$, where\n$A, \\Omega, Z, I$ are defined as follows:\n\nThe alpha set $A$ is a finite set of symbols that is large enough to\nsupply the needs of a given discussion, for example:\n\n> $A = \\{ p, q, r, s, t, u \\}$.\n\nThe omega set $\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\cup \\Omega_2$ partitions as follows:\n\n> $\\Omega_1 = \\{ \\lnot \\}$,\n>\n> $\\Omega_2 = \\{ \\land, \\lor, \\Rightarrow, \\Leftrightarrow \\}$.\n\nIn the following example of a propositional calculus, the transformation\nrules are intended to be interpreted as the inference rules of a\nso-called *natural deduction system*. The particular system presented\nhere has no initial points, which means that its interpretation for\nlogical applications derives its theorems from an empty axiom set.\n\nTo be continued $\\ldots$\n\nDocument history\n================\n\nPortions of the above article are adapted from the following sources\nunder the GNU Free Documentation License, under other applicable\nlicenses, or by permission of the copyright holders.\n\n-   , .\n\n-   , .\n\n-   , .\n\n-   , .",
