  "definition": "The [*argument*]{} of a function is its input. For example, in the\nexpression $f(x)$, $x$ is the argument of $f$.\n\nA common error for those who are unfamiliar with mathematics is to treat\na function and its argument as two separate entities. For example, in\nsolving the equation $\\ln x=5$ for $x$, people who are unfamiliar with\nmathematics may give the erroneous answer\n$\\displaystyle x=\\frac{5}{\\ln}$. This error might be circumvented by\nstressing that a function and its argument are not multiplied, but\nrather that a function its argument.\n\nAnother common error is to try to separate the argument of a function.\nThis error is most common when the argument consists of at least two .\nFor example, students may write $f(x+5)=f(x)+f(5)$ regardless of what\nthe function $f$ is.",
