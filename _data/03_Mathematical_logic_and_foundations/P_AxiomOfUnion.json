  "statement": "For any $X$ there exists a set $Y = \\bigcup X$.\n\nThe Axiom of Union is an axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. In\nsymbols, it reads\n$$\\forall X \\exists Y \\forall u (u \\in Y \\leftrightarrow \\exists z (z \\in X \\land u \\in z)).$$\n\nNotice that this means that $Y$ is the set of elements of all elements\nof $X$. More succinctly, the union of any set of sets is a set. By\nExtensionality, the set $Y$ is unique. $Y$ is called the *union* of $X$.\n\nIn particular, the Axiom of Union, along with the Axiom of Pairing\nallows us to define $$X \\cup Y = \\bigcup \\{ X, Y \\},$$ as well as the\ntriple $$\\{ a, b, c \\} = \\{ a, b \\} \\cup \\{ c \\}$$ and therefore the\n$n$-tuple\n$$\\{ a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\} = \\{ a_1 \\} \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\{ a_n \\}$$",
