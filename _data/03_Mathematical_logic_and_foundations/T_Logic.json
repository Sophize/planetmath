  "definition": "Generally, by logic, people mean first order logic, a formal set of\nrules for building mathematical statements out of symbols like $\\neg$\n(negation) and $\\rightarrow$ (implication) along with quantifiers like\n$\\forall$ (for every) and $\\exists$ (there exists).\n\nMore generally, a *logic* is any set of rules for forming sentences (the\nlogic\u2019s *syntax*) together with rules for assigning truth values to them\n(the logic\u2019s *semantics*). Normally it includes a (possibly empty) set\nof *types* $T$ (also called *sorts*), which represent the different\nkinds of objects that the theory discusses (typical examples might be\nsets, numbers, or sets of numbers). In addition it specifies particular\nquantifiers, connectives, and variables. Particular theories in the\nlogic can then add relations and functions to fully specify a logical\nlanguage.",
