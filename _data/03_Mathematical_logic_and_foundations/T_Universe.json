  "definition": "A [*universe*]{} $\\mathbf{U}$ is a nonempty set satisfying the following\naxioms:\n\n1.  If $x\\in \\mathbf{U}$ and $y\\in x$, then $y\\in \\mathbf{U}$.\n\n2.  If $x,y\\in \\mathbf{U}$, then $\\{x,y\\}\\in \\mathbf{U}$.\n\n3.  If $x\\in\\mathbf{U}$, then the power set\n    $\\mathcal{P}(x)\\in\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n4.  If $\\{x_i | i\\in I\\in\\mathbf{U}\\}$ is a family of elements of\n    $\\mathbf{U}$, then $\\cup_{i\\in I} x_i\\in\\mathbf{U}$.\n\nFrom these axioms, one can deduce the following properties:\n\n1.  If $x\\in\\mathbf{U}$, then $\\{x\\}\\in\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n2.  If $x$ is a subset of $y\\in\\mathbf{U}$, then $x\\in\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n3.  If $x,y\\in\\mathbf{U}$, then the ordered pair $(x,y) = \\{\\{x,y\\},x\\}$\n    is in $\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n4.  If $x,y\\in\\mathbf{U}$, then $x\\cup y$ and $x\\times y$ are in\n    $\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n5.  If $\\{x_i | i\\in I\\in\\mathbf{U}\\}$ is a family of elements of\n    $\\mathbf{U}$, then the product $\\prod_{i\\in I} x_i$ is in\n    $\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n6.  If $x\\in \\mathbf{U}$, then the cardinality of $x$ is strictly less\n    than the cardinality of $\\mathbf{U}$. In particular,\n    $\\mathbf{U}\\notin\\mathbf{U}$.\n\nIn order for uncountable universes to exist, it is necessary to adopt an\nextra axiom for set theory. This is usually phrased as:\n\nFor every cardinal $\\alpha$, there exists a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal $\\beta>\\alpha$.\n\nThis axiom cannot be proven using the axioms ZFC. But it seems\n(according to Bourbaki) that it probably cannot be proven not to lead to\na contradiction.\n\nOne usually also assumes\n\nFor every set $X$, there is no infinite descending chain\n$\\cdots\\in x_2 \\in x_1 \\in X$; this is called being *artinian*.\n\nThis axiom does not affect the consistency of ZFC, that is, ZFC is\nconsistent if and only if ZFC with this axiom added is consistent. This\nis also known as the axiom of foundation, and it is often included with\nZFC. If it is not accepted, then one can for all practical purposes\nrestrict oneself to working within the class of artinian sets.\n\nFinally, one must be careful when using relations within universes; the\ndetails are too technical for Bourbaki to work out (!), but see the\nappendix to Expos\u00e9 1 of [@sga4] for more detail.\n\nThe standard reference for universes is [@sga4].\n\n[9]{} Grothendieck et al. *Seminaires en Geometrie Algebrique 4*, Tome\n1, Expos\u00e9 1 (or the appendix to Expos\u00e9 1, by N. Bourbaki for more detail\nand a large number of results there described as \u201cne pouvant servir \u00e0\nrien\u201d). SGA4 is on the Web. (It is in French.)",
