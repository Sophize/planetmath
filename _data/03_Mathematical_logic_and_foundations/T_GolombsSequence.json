  "definition": "[*Golomb\u2019s sequence*]{} is a self-referential ascending order sequence\nof integers $a$ in which the number of times each number $n$ occurrs is\ngiven by $a_n$. The sequence begins 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6,\n6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, ...\n(see A001462 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS). For example, $a_3 = 2$ and indeed 3\noccurs twice in the sequence. $a_4 = 3$, so 4 occurs thrice.\n\nThe recurrence relation for the sequence is $a_1 = 1$ and\n$a_n = a_{n - a_{a_{a_{n - 1}}}} + 1$. Sometimes recurrence relations\nfor this sequence are given which also explicitly set $a_2 = 2$. The\n$n$th term of the sequence can be obtained by the calculating\n$\\phi^{2 - \\phi} n^{\\phi - 1}$ (with $$\\phi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\nbeing the golden ratio) and rounding off to the nearest integer. For\nexample, with precision to five decimal places: 1.20178, 1.84448,\n2.36975, 2.83087, 3.24948, 3.63706, 4.0006, 4.34477, 4.67284, 4.98724,\n5.28984, 5.58209, 5.86518, 6.14005, 6.40753, 6.66827, 6.92286, 7.17178,\n7.41548, etc.",
