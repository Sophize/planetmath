  "statement": "When there is a one-to-one function from a set $A$ to a set $B$, we say\nthat $A$ is *embeddable* in $B$, and write $A \\le B$. Thus $\\le$ is a\n(class) binary relation on the class $V$ of all sets. This relation is\nclearly reflexive and transitive. If $A\\le B$ and $B\\le A$, then, by\nSchr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem, $A$ is bijective to $B$, $A\\sim B$. However,\nclearly $A\\ne B$ in general. Therefore $\\le$ fails to be a partial\norder. However, since $A\\sim B$ iff they have the same cardinality,\n$|A|=|B|$, and since cardinals are by definition sets, the class of all\ncardinals becomes a partially ordered set with partial order $\\le$. We\nrecord this result as a theorem:\n\nIn ZF, the relation $\\le$ is a partial order on the cardinals.\n\nWith the addition of the axiom of choice, one can show that $\\le$ is a\nlinear order on the cardinals. In fact, the statement \u201c$\\le$ is a linear\norder on the cardinals\u201d is equivalent to the axiom of choice.\n\nIn ZF, the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  the axiom of choice\n\n2.  $\\le$ is a linear order on the cardinals\n\nRestating the second statement, we have that for any two sets $A,B$,\nthere is an injection from one to the other. The plan is to use Zorn\u2019s\nlemma to prove the second statement, and use the second statement to\nprove the well-ordering principle (WOP).\n\nZorn implies Statement 2:\n\n:   Suppose there are no injections from $A$ to $B$. We need to find an\n    injection from $B$ to $A$. We may assume that $B\\ne \\varnothing$,\n    for otherwise $\\varnothing$ is an injection from $B$ to $A$. Let $P$\n    be the collection of all partial injective functions from $B$ to\n    $A$. $P$, as a collection of relations between $B$ and $A$, is a\n    set. $P\\ne \\varnothing$, since any function from a singleton subset\n    of $B$ into $A$ is in $P$. Order $P$ by set inclusion, so $P$\n    becomes a poset. Suppose $F$ is a chain of partial functions in $P$,\n    let us look at $f:=\\bigcup F$. Suppose $(a,b),(a,c)\\in f$. Then\n    $(a,b)\\in p$ and $(a,c)\\in q$ for some $p,q\\in F$. Since $F$ is a\n    chain, one is a subset of the other, so say, $p\\subseteq q$. Then\n    $(a,b)\\in q$, and since $q$ is a partial function, $b=c$. This shows\n    that $f$ is a partial function. Next, suppose $(a,c),(b,c)\\in f$. By\n    the same argument used to show that $f$ is a function, we see that\n    $a=b$, so that $f$ is injective. Therefore $f\\in P$. Thus, by Zorn\u2019s\n    lemma, $P$ has a maximal element $g$. We want to show that $g$ is\n    defined on all of $B$. Now, $g$ can not be surjective, or else $g$\n    is a bijection from $\\operatorname{dom}(g)$ onto $A$. Then\n    $g^{-1}: A\\to B$ is an injection, contrary to the assumption.\n    Therefore, we may pick an element $a\\in A-\\operatorname{ran}(g)$.\n    Now, if $\\operatorname{dom}(g)\\ne B$, we may pick an element\n    $b\\in B-\\operatorname{dom}(g)$. Then the partial function\n    $g^*: \\operatorname{dom}(g)\\cup \\lbrace b\\rbrace \\to A$ given by\n    $$g^*(x)= \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    g(x) \\quad \\mbox{ if }x\\in \\operatorname{dom}(g),\\\\\n    a \\quad \\mbox{ if } x = b.\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ Since $g^*$ is injective by construction, $g^*\\in P$.\n    Since $g^*$ properly extends $g$, we have reached a contradiction,\n    as $g$ is maximal in $P$. Therefore the domain of $g$ is all of $B$,\n    and is our desired injective function from $B$ to $A$.\n\nStatement 2 implies WOP:\n\n:   Let $A$ be a set and let $h(A)$ be its Hartogs number. Since $h(A)$\n    is not embeddable in $A$, by statement 2, $A$ is embeddable in\n    $h(A)$. Let $f$ be the injection from $A$ to $h(A)$ is injective.\n    Since $h(A)$ is an ordinal, it is well-ordered. Therefore, as $f(A)$\n    is well-ordered, and because $A\\sim f(A)$, $A$ itself is\n    well-orderable via the well-ordering on $f(A)$.\n\nSince Zorn\u2019s lemma and the well-ordering principles are both equivalent\nto AC in ZF, the theorem is proved.",
