  "definition": "A *well-ordered* set is a totally ordered set in which every nonempty\nsubset has a least member.\n\nAn example of well-ordered set is the set of positive integers with the\nstandard order relation $(\\mathbbmss{Z}^+,<)$, because any nonempty\nsubset of it has least member. However, $\\mathbbmss{R}^+$ (the positive\nreals) is not a well-ordered set with the usual order, because\n$(0,1)=\\{x:0<x<1\\}$ is a nonempty subset but it doesn\u2019t contain a least\nnumber.\n\nA **well-ordering** of a set $X$ is the result of defining a binary\nrelation $\\leq$ on $X$ to itself in such a way that $X$ becomes\nwell-ordered with respect to $\\leq$.",
