  "definition": "In propositional logic, the usual way of forming a well-formed formula\nout of existing ones is by attaching a designated symbol to the existing\nwffs. This designated symbol is variously known as a *logical\nconnective*, *logical symbol*, or simply a *connective*. Given a\nconnective, the number of wffs needed to form a new wff is a fixed\ninteger, and is called the *arity* of the connective. For example, if\n$\\#$ is a connective of arity 3, and $p,q,r$ are three existing wffs,\nthen $$\\#pqr$$ is the wff formed by attaching $\\#$ to the $p,q$ and $r$\n*in order*. Instead of prefixing to the string of wffs as above, the\nconnective may also be attached at the end (as a suffix), or customarily\ninfixed in case it has arity of 2 (binary). $0$-ary connectives are also\nallowed, in which case it is just a symbol with no wffs attached.\n\nThe common classical logical connectives are:\n\n-   $\\lnot$: ;\n\n-   $\\lor$: logical or;\n\n-   $\\land$: logical and;\n\n-   $\\rightarrow$ or $\\supset$: material implication; and\n\n-   $\\leftrightarrow$ or $\\equiv$: .\n\nThe symbols $\\supset$ and $\\equiv$ are due to Russell.\n\n**Remark**. \u201c*Logical implication*\u201d $\\to$ and \u201c*logical is equivalent\nto*\u201d $\\leftrightarrow$ symbols are typically used for logicians.\nNevertheless, the symbols $\\Rightarrow$ for material implication and\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ for material equivalence are commonly used in the\nliterature. In particular, $\\to$ is usually reserved for the concept of\nlimit.\n\nUsually, given a logical connective $\\#$, a truth function is\nassociated. The arity of the truth function is defined to be the arity\nof the connective. When there is no confusion, the symbol for the\nassociated truth function is the same as the symbol of the connective. A\ntruth function of small arity can be easily represented by a table,\ncalled the *truth table* of the truth function. The truth functions and\ntruth tables associated with the connectives listed above are\n\n-   $\\lnot: \\boldsymbol{2} \\to \\boldsymbol{2}$ given by $\\lnot(x)=1-x$;\n\n       $P$   $\\lnot P$\n      ----- -----------\n        F        T\n        T        F\n\n-   $\\lor: \\boldsymbol{2}^2 \\to \\boldsymbol{2}$ given by\n    $\\lor(x,y)=\\max(x,y)$;\n\n       $P$   $Q$   $P \\lor Q$\n      ----- ----- ------------\n        F     F        F\n        F     T        T\n        T     F        T\n        T     T        T\n\n-   $\\land: \\boldsymbol{2}^2 \\to \\boldsymbol{2}$ given by\n    $\\land(x,y)=\\min(x,y)$;\n\n       $P$   $Q$   $P \\land Q$\n      ----- ----- -------------\n        F     F         F\n        F     T         F\n        T     F         F\n        T     T         T\n\n-   $\\rightarrow: \\boldsymbol{2}^2 \\to \\boldsymbol{2}$ given by\n    $\\rightarrow(x,y)=\\max(1-x,y)$; and\n\n       $P$   $Q$   $P \\rightarrow Q$\n      ----- ----- -------------------\n        F     F            T\n        F     T            T\n        T     F            F\n        T     T            T\n\n-   $\\leftrightarrow: \\boldsymbol{2}^2 \\to \\boldsymbol{2}$ given by\n    $\\leftrightarrow(x,y)=(x+y+1) \\pmod 2$.\n\n       $P$   $Q$   $P \\leftrightarrow Q$\n      ----- ----- -----------------------\n        F     F              T\n        F     T              F\n        T     F              F\n        T     T              T\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{2}=\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$. Note that $0$ and $1$ have\nbeen converted to $F$ and $T$ in the tables above.\n\nAny truth function of any finite arity can be written as a finite\ncombination of these connectives (see the entry on functional\ncompleteness). However, the collection is redundant; the final three\nsymbols, $\\land$, $\\rightarrow$, and $\\leftrightarrow$, can be defined\nin terms of prior ones. By DeMorgan\u2019s law, we can define logical and by\n$$P\\land Q := \\lnot P\\lor \\lnot Q.$$ Material implication can be defined\nby $$P\\rightarrow Q := \\lnot P\\lor Q.$$ Finally, material equivalence\ncan be defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\nP\\leftrightarrow Q \n&:= (P\\rightarrow Q)\\land(Q\\rightarrow P) \\\\\n&= \\lnot(\\lnot P\\lor Q)\\lor\\lnot(\\lnot Q\\lor P).\\end{aligned}$$ Hence\n$\\lnot$ and $\\vee$ suffice to define all other connectives.",
