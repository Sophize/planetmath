  "definition": "A *Mealy machine* $M$ is a five-tuple\n$(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\sigma,\\lambda)$, where\n\n1.  $S$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *states*,\n\n2.  $\\Sigma$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *input symbols*,\n\n3.  $\\Delta$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *output symbols*,\n\n4.  $\\sigma: S\\times \\Sigma \\to S$ is a function called the *state\n    transition function*,\n\n5.  $\\lambda: S\\times \\Sigma \\to \\Delta$ is a function called the\n    *output function*.\n\nGiven an a pair $(s,a)$ of state $s$ and input symbol $a$, the value\n$\\sigma(s,a)$ is the *next state* of $(s,a)$ and $\\lambda(s,a)$ is the\n*output* of $(s,a)$.\n\nSince all of the sets involved are finite, there are two ways to\nvisualize a Mealy machine: via a table called the *flow table*\ndescribing the transition and the output functions, or via a directed\ngraph called the *state diagram* (see details below).\n\nFor example, consider a Mealy machine $M$ where $S=\\lbrace s,t\\rbrace$,\n$\\Sigma = \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and $\\Delta = \\lbrace x,y\\rbrace$. The\nstate transition function $\\sigma$ and the output function $\\lambda$ are\ndefined by the following table:\n\n         $a$   $b$   $a$   $b$\n  ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n   $s$   $t$   $s$   $y$   $y$\n   $t$   $s$   $t$   $x$   $y$\n\nThe first column represents all the states of $M$; the second and third\ncolumns are the next states corresponding to the input symbols specified\non the top row; and the last two columns show the corresponding output\nsymbols.\n\nIn addition, one can visualize a Mealy machine $M$ by way its state\ndiagram $G_M$, which is a (labeled) directed graph. $G_M$ is constructed\nas follows: the vertices of $G_M$ are states of $M$. An edge from\nvertices $s$ to $t$ is constructed iff there is an input $a$ such that\n$\\sigma(s,a)=t$. Let $x=\\lambda(s,a)$ be the corresponding output. Then\nthe edge from $s$ to $t$ is given a label $a|x$. In the example above,\nthe state diagram $G_M$ of $M$ is the following\n\n![image](mealy.eps)\n\n**Remark**.\n\n-   A Mealy machine with only one state is called a *combinational\n    circuit*. It is nothing more than a finite function $\\lambda$ from\n    the set of inputs $I$ to the set of outputs $O$.\n\n-   A Mealy machine can be thought of as a state-output machine, if one\n    treats the values of $\\sigma$ and $\\lambda$ as singleton subsets of\n    $S$ and $\\Delta$ respectively. In this regard, a Mealy machine is\n    complete because both $\\sigma(s,a)$ and $\\lambda(s,a)$ contain at\n    least one element each, for all pairs $(s,a)\\in S\\times \\Sigma$, and\n    sequential because both $\\sigma(s,a)$ and $\\lambda(s,a)$ contain at\n    most one element each. As such, a Mealy machine is also known as a\n    *complete sequential machine*.\n\nViewed as a state-output machine, the transition and output functions of\na Mealy machine can be extended so input words may be applied to the\nmachine. For the transition function $\\sigma$, the extension is defined\ninductively on the length of input words:\n$$\\sigma(s,\\epsilon):=s, \\mbox{ and } \\sigma(s,ua):=\\sigma(\\sigma(s,u),a), \\mbox{ where }s\\in S, u\\in \\Sigma^*, a\\in \\Sigma.$$\nLike the transition function $\\sigma$, the output function $\\lambda$ is\nalso extended inductively on the length of input words:\n$$\\lambda(s,ua):=\\lambda(\\sigma(s,u),a), \\mbox{ where }s\\in S, u\\in \\Sigma^*, a\\in \\Sigma.$$\nHowever, unlike $\\sigma$, $\\lambda$ is not defined for the empty input\nword $\\epsilon$.\n\n[8]{} S.
