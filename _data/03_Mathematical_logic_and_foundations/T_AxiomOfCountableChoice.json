  "definition": "The *Axiom of Countable Choice* (CC) is a weak form of the . It states\nthat every countable set of nonempty sets has a choice function.\n\n(that is, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the Axiom of\nCountable Choice) suffices to prove that the union of countably many\ncountable sets is countable. It also suffices to prove that every\ninfinite set has a countably infinite subset, and that a set $X$ is\ninfinite if and only if there is a bijection between $X$ and a proper\nsubset of $X$.",
