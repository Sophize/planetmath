  "statement": "In this entry, we show that the Ackermann function $A(x,y)$, given by\n$$A(0,y)=y+1, \\qquad A(x+1,0)=A(x,1), \\qquad A(x+1,y+1) = A(x,A(x+1,y))$$\nis not primitive recursive. We will utilize the properties of $A$ listed\nin .\n\nThe key to showing that $A$ is not primitive recursive, is to find a\nproperties shared by all primitive recursive functions, but not by $A$.\nOne such property is in showing that $A$ in some way \u201cgrows\u201d faster than\nany primitive recursive function. This is formalized by the notion of\n\u201cmajorization\u201d, which is explained .\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all functions majorized by $A$. Then\n$\\mathcal{PR} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nWe break this up into three parts: show all initial functions are in\n$\\mathcal{A}$, show $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under functional\ncomposition, and show $\\mathcal{A}$ is closed under primitive recursion.\nThe proof is completed by realizing that $\\mathcal{PR}$ is the smallest\nset satisfying the three conditions.\n\nIn the proofs below, $\\boldsymbol{x}$ denotes some tuple of non-negative\nintegers $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ for some $n$, and\n$x = \\max\\lbrace x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\rbrace$. Likewise for $\\boldsymbol{y}$\nand $y$.\n\n1.  We show that the zero function, the successor function, and the\n    projection functions are in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n    -   $z(n)=0 < n+1=A(0,n)$, so $z\\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\n    -   $s(n)=n+1 < n+2 = A(1,n)$, so $s\\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\n    -   $p_m^k(x_1,\\ldots, x_k)=x_m \\le x < x+1 = A(0,x)$, so\n        $p_m^k \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\n2.  Next, suppose $g_1, \\ldots, g_m$ are $k$-ary, and $h$ is $m$-ary,\n    and that each $g_i$, and $h$ are in $\\mathcal{A}$. This means that\n    $g_i(\\boldsymbol{x}) < A(r_i,x)$, and $h(\\boldsymbol{y}) < A(s,y)$.\n    Let\n    $$f=h(g_1,\\ldots,g_m), \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad g_j(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\max \\lbrace g_i(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\mid i=1,\\ldots, m \\rbrace.$$\n    Then\n    $f(\\boldsymbol{x}) < A(s,g_j(\\boldsymbol{x})) < A(s, A(r_j, x)) < A(s+ r_j+2,x)$,\n    showing that $f\\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\n3.  Finally, suppose $g$ is $k$-ary and $h$ is $(k+2)$-ary, and that\n    $g,h\\in \\mathcal{A}$. This means that $g(\\boldsymbol{x})< A(r,x)$\n    and $h(\\boldsymbol{y}) < A(s,y)$. We want to show that $f$, defined\n    by primitive recursion via functions $g$ and $h$, is in\n    $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n    We first prove the following claim:\n    $$f(\\boldsymbol{x},n)<A(q,n+x), \\quad \\mbox{for some }q\\mbox{ not depending on }x\\mbox{ and }n.$$\n\n    Pick $q=1+\\max \\lbrace r,s\\rbrace$, and induct on $n$. First,\n    $f(\\boldsymbol{x},0) = g(\\boldsymbol{x}) < A(r,x) <  A(q,x)$. Next,\n    suppose $f(\\boldsymbol{x},n)< A(q,n+x)$. Then\n    $f(\\boldsymbol{x},n+1) = h(\\boldsymbol{x},n, f(\\boldsymbol{x},n)) < A(s, z)$,\n    where $z=\\max \\lbrace x,n, f(\\boldsymbol{x},n)\\rbrace$. By the\n    induction hypothesis, together with the fact that\n    $\\max\\lbrace x,n\\rbrace \\le n+x < A(q,n+x)$, we see that\n    $z<A(q,n+x)$. Thus,\n    $f(\\boldsymbol{x},n+1) < A(s,z) < A(s,A(q,n+x)) \\le A(q-1,A(q,n+x)) = A(q,n+1+x)$,\n    proving the claim.\n\n    To finish the proof, let $z=\\max\\lbrace x,y\\rbrace$. Then, by the\n    claim,\n    $f(\\boldsymbol{x},y) < A(q,x+y) \\le A(q,2z) < A(q,2z+3) = A(q,A(2,z))=A(q+4,z)$,\n    showing that $f\\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{PR}$ is by definition the smallest set containing the\ninitial functions, and closed under composition and primitive recursion,\n$\\mathcal{PR}\\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nAs a corollary, we have\n\nThe Ackermann function $A$ is not primitive recursive.\n\nOtherwise, $A\\in \\mathcal{A}$, which is impossible.",
