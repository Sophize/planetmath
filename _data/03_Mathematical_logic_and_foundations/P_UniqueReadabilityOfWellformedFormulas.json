  "statement": "Suppose $V$ is an alphabet. Two words $w_1$ and $w_2$ over $V$ are the\nsame if they have the same length and same symbol for every position of\nthe word. In other words, if $w_1 = a_1\\cdots a_n$ and\n$w_2 = b_1\\cdots b_m$, where each $a_i$ and $b_i$ are symbols in $V$,\nthen $n=m$ and $a_i=b_i$. In other words, every word over $V$ has a\nunique representation as product (concatenation) of symbols in $V$. This\nis called the *unique readability* of words over an alphabet.\n\nUnique readability remains true if $V$ is infinite. Now, suppose $V$ is\na set of propositional variables, and suppose we have two well-formed\nformulas (wffs) $p:=\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n$ and $q:=\\beta q_1 \\cdots q_m$\nover $V$, where $\\alpha, \\beta$ are logical connectives from a fixed set\n$F$ of connectives (for example, $F$ could be the set\n$\\lbrace \\neg, \\vee, \\wedge, \\to, \\leftrightarrow \\rbrace$), and\n$p_i,q_j$ are wffs. Does $p=q$ mean $\\alpha = \\beta$, $m=n$, and\n$p_i=q_i$? This is the notion of *unique readability* of well-formed\nformulas. It is slightly different from the unique readability of words\nover an alphabet, for $p_i$ and $q_j$ are no longer symbols in an\nalphabet, but words themselves.\n\nGiven any countable set $V$ of propositional variables and a set $F$ of\nlogical connectives, well-formed formulas over $V$ constructed via $F$\nare uniquely readable\n\nEvery $p\\in \\overline{V}$ has a representation $\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n$\nfor some $n$-ary connective $\\alpha$ and wffs $p_i$. The rest of the\nproof we show that this representation is unique, establishing unique\nreadability.\n\nDefine a function $\\phi: V\\cup F \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\phi(v)=1$\nfor any $v\\in V$, and $\\phi(f)=1-n$ for any $n$-ary connective $f\\in F$.\nDefined inductively on the length of words over $V\\cup F$, $\\phi$ can be\nextended to an integer-valued function $\\phi^*$ on the set of all words\non $V\\cup F$ so that $\\phi^*(w_1w_2)=\\phi^*(w_1)+\\phi^*(w_2)$, for any\nwords $w_1,w_2$ over $V\\cup F$. We have\n\n1.  $\\phi^*$ is constant (whose value is $1$) when restricted to\n    $\\overline{V}$.\n\n    This can be proved by induction on $V_i$ (for the definition of\n    $V_i$, see the parent entry). By definition, this is true for any\n    atoms. Assume this is true for $V_i$. Pick any $p\\in V_{i+1}$. Then\n    $p=\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n$ for some $n$-ary $\\alpha \\in F$, and\n    $p_j\\in V_i$ for all $j=1,\\ldots, n$ Then\n    $\\phi^*(p)= \\phi^*(\\alpha) + \\phi^*(p_1) + \\cdots + \\phi^*(p_n) = 1 - n + n\\times 1 = 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\phi^*(p)=1$ for all $p\\in \\overline{V}$.\n\n2.  for any non-trivial suffix $s$ of a wff $p$, $\\phi^*(s)>0$. (A\n    *suffix* of a word $w$ is a word $s$ such that $w=ts$ for some word\n    $t$; $s$ is non-trivial if $s$ is not the empty word)\n\n    This is also proved by induction. If $p\\in V_0$, then $p$ itself is\n    its only non-trivial final segment, so the assertion is true.\n    Suppose now this is true for any proposition in $V_i$. If\n    $p \\in V_{i+1}$, then $p=\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n$, where each\n    $p_k\\in V_i$. A non-trivial final segment $s$ of $p$ is either $p$,\n    a final segment of $p_n$, or has the form $tp_j \\cdots p_n$, where\n    $t$ is a non-trivial final segment of $p_{j-1}$. In the first case,\n    $\\phi^*(s)=\\phi^*(p)=1$. In the second case, $\\phi^*(s)>0$ from\n    assumption. In the last case, $\\phi^*(s)=\\phi^*(t)+(n-j+1)>0$.\n\nNow, back to the main proof. Suppose $p=q$. If $p$ is an atom, so must\n$q$, and we are done. Otherwise, assume\n$p = \\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_m = \\beta q_1 \\cdots q_n = q$. Then\n$\\alpha = \\beta$ since the expressions are words over $V\\cup F$, and\n$\\alpha ,\\beta\\in F$. Since the two connectives are the same, they have\nthe same arity: $m=n$, and we have\n$\\alpha p_1 \\cdots p_n = \\alpha q_1 \\cdots q_n$. If $n=0$, then we are\ndone. So assume $n>0$. Then $p_1\\cdots p_n = q_1 \\cdots q_n$. We want to\nshow that $p_n=q_n$, and therefore\n$p_1 \\cdots p_{n-1} = q_1 \\cdots q_{n-1}$, and by induction $p_i = q_i$\nfor all $i< n$ as well, proving the theorem.\n\nFirst, notice that $p_n$ is a non-trivial suffix of $q_1 \\cdots q_n$. So\n$p_n$ is either a suffix of $q_n$ or has the form $t q_j \\cdots q_n$,\nwhere $j\\le n$, and $t$ is a non-trivial suffix of $q_{j-1}$. In the\nlatter case,\n$1 = \\phi^*(p_n) = \\phi^*(t q_j \\cdots q_n)= \\phi^*(t) + n-j+1$. Then\n$\\phi^*(t) = j-n \\le 0$, contradicting 2 above. Therefore $p_n$ is a\nsuffix of $q_n$. By symmetry, $q_n$ is also a suffix of $p_n$, hence\n$p_n=q_n$.\n\nAs a corollary, we see that the well-formed formulas of the classical\npropositional logic, written in Polish notation, are uniquely readable.\nThe unique readability of wffs using parentheses and infix notation\nrequires a different proof.\n\n**Remark**. Unique readability will fail if the $p_i$ and $q_j$ above\nare not wffs, even if $V$ is finite. For example, suppose $v\\in V$ and\n$\\#$ is binary, then $\\# v \\# vv$ can be read in three non-trivial ways:\ncombining $v$ and $\\#vv$, combining $v\\#$ and $vv$, or combining $v\\#v$\nand $v$. Notice that only the first combination do we get wffs.",
