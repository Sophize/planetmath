  "definition": "The following are alternative ways of characterizing a countable set.\n\nLet $A$ be a set and $\\mathbb{N}$ the set of natural numbers. The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n1.  there is a surjection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $A$.\n\n2.  there is an injection from $A$ to $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\n3.  either $A$ is finite or there is a bijection between $A$ and\n    $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nFirst notice that if $A$ were the empty set, then any map to or from $A$\nis empty, so $(1)\\Leftrightarrow (2) \\Leftrightarrow (3)$ vacuously.\nNow, suppose that $A \\ne \\varnothing$.\n\n$(1)\\Rightarrow (2)$. Suppose $f: \\mathbb{N}\\to A$ is a surjection. For\neach $a\\in A$, let $f^{-1}(a)$ be the set\n$\\lbrace n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid f(n)=a\\rbrace$. Since $f^{-1}(a)$ is a\nsubset of $\\mathbb{N}$, which is well-ordered, $f^{-1}(a)$ itself is\nwell-ordered, and thus has a least element (keep in mind\n$A\\ne \\varnothing$, the existence of $a\\in A$ is guaranteed, so that\n$f^{-1}(a)\\ne \\varnothing$ as well). Let $g(a)$ be this least element.\nThen $a \\mapsto g(a)$ is a well-defined mapping from $A$ to\n$\\mathbb{N}$. It is one-to-one, for if $g(a)=g(b)=n$, then $a=f(n)=b$.\n\n$(2)\\Rightarrow (1)$. Suppose $g:A\\to \\mathbb{N}$ is one-to-one. So\n$g^{-1}(n)$ is at most a singleton for every $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. If it is\na singleton, identify $g^{-1}(n)$ with that element. Otherwise, identify\n$g^{-1}(n)$ with a designated element $a_0\\in A$ (remember $A$ is\nnon-empty). Define a function $f:\\mathbb{N} \\to A$ by $f(n):=g^{-1}(n)$.\nBy the discussion above, $g^{-1}(n)$ is a well-defined element of $A$,\nand therefore $f$ is well-defined. $f$ is onto because for every\n$a\\in A$, $f(g(a))=a$.\n\n$(3)\\Rightarrow (2)$ is clear.\n\n$(2)\\Rightarrow (3)$. Let $g: A\\to \\mathbb{N}$ be an injection. Then\n$g(A)$ is either finite or infinite. If $g(A)$ is finite, so is $A$,\nsince they are equinumerous. Suppose $g(A)$ is infinite. Since\n$g(A) \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, it is well-ordered. The (induced)\nwell-ordering on $g(A)$ implies that\n$g(A)=\\lbrace n_1, n_2, \\ldots \\rbrace$, where $n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots$.\n\nNow, define $h: \\mathbb{N}\\to A$ as follows, for each $i\\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n$h(i)$ is the element in $A$ such that $g(h(i))=n_i$. So $h$ is\nwell-defined. Next, $h$ is injective. For if $h(i)=h(j)$, then\n$n_i = g(h(i))=g(h(j)) = n_j$, implying $i=j$. Finally, $h$ is a\nsurjection, for if we pick any $a\\in A$, then $g(a)\\in g(A)$, meaning\nthat $g(a)=n_i$ for some $i$, so $h(i)=g(a)$.\n\nTherefore, countability can be defined in terms of either of the above\nthree statements.\n\nNote that the axiom of choice is not needed in the proof of\n$(1)\\Rightarrow (2)$, since the selection of an element in $f^{-1}(a)$\nis definite, not arbitrary.\n\nFor example, we show that $\\mathbb{N}^2$ is countable. By the\nproposition above, we either need to find a surjection\n$f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}^2$, or an injection\n$g: \\mathbb{N}^2 \\to \\mathbb{N}$. Actually, in this case, we can find\nboth:\n\n1.  the function $f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}^2$ given by $f(a)=(m,n)$\n    where $a=2^m(2n+1)$ is surjective. First, the function is\n    well-defined, for every positive integer has a unique representation\n    as the product of a power of $2$ and an odd number. It is surjective\n    because for every $(m,n)$, we see that $f(2^m(2n+1))=(m,n)$.\n\n2.  the function $g:\\mathbb{N}^2 \\to \\mathbb{N}$ given by\n    $f(m,n)=2^m 3^n$ is clearly injective.\n\nNote that the injectivity of $g$, as well as $f$ being well-defined,\nrely on the unique factorization of integers by prime numbers. In this ,\nwe actually find a bijection between $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{N}^2$.\n\nAs a corollary, we record the following:\n\nLet $A,B$ be sets, $f:A\\to B$ a function.\n\n-   If $f$ is an injection, and $B$ is countable, so is $A$.\n\n-   If $f$ is a surjection, and $A$ countable, so is $B$.\n\nThe proof is left to the reader.",
