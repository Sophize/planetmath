  "definition": "### Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n\nLet $A$ be a poset ordered by $\\le$. A subset $B$ of $A$ is called a\n*chain* in $A$ if any two elements of $B$ are comparable. In other\nwords, if $a,b\\in B$, then either $a\\le b$ or $b\\le a$, that is, $\\le$\nis a total order on $B$, or that $B$ is a linearly ordered subset of\n$A$. When $a\\le b$, we also write $b\\ge a$. When $a\\le b$ and $a\\ne b$,\nwe write $a<b$. When $a\\ge b$ and $a\\ne b$, then we write $a>b$. A poset\nis a *chain* if it is a chain as a subset of itself. The *cardinality*\nof a chain is the cardinality of the underlying set.\n\nBelow are some common examples of chains:\n\n1.  $\\mathbf{n}:=\\lbrace 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\rbrace$ is a chain under the\n    usual order ($a\\le b$ iff $b-a$ is non-negative). This is an example\n    of a *finite chain*: a chain whose cardinality is finite. Any finite\n    set $A$ can be made into a chain, since there is a bijection from\n    $\\mathbf{n}$ onto $A$, and the total order on $A$ is induced by the\n    order on $\\mathbf{n}$. A chain that is not finite is called an\n    *infinite chain*.\n\n2.  $\\mathbb{N}$, the set of natural numbers, is a chain under the usual\n    order. Here we have an example of a well-ordered set: a chain such\n    that every non-empty subset has a minimal element (as in a poset).\n    Other well-ordered sets are the set $\\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ of positive\n    rationals and $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$ of positive reals. The well-ordering\n    principle states that every set can be well-ordered. It can be shown\n    that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the well-ordering\n    principle.\n\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers, is a chain under the usual order.\n\n4.  $\\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rationals, is a chain under the usual\n    order. This is an example of a *dense chain*: a chain such that for\n    every pair of distinct elements $a<b$, there is an element $c$ such\n    that $a<c<b$.\n\n5.  $\\mathbb{R}$, the set of reals, is a chain under the usual order.\n    This is an example of a *Dedekind complete chain*: a chain such that\n    every non-empty bounded subset has a supremum and an infimum.\n\n### Constructing chains {#constructing-chains .unnumbered}\n\nOne easy way to produce a new chain from an existing one is to form the\n*dual* of the existing chain: if $A$ is a chain, form $A^{\\partial}$ so\nthat $a\\le b$ in $A^{\\partial}$ iff $b\\le a$ in $A$.\n\nAnother way to produce new chains from existing ones is to form a *join*\nof chains. Given two chains $A,B$, we can form a new chain $A\\coprod B$.\nThe basic idea is to form the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$, and order\nthis newly constructed set so that the order among elements of $A$ is\npreserved, and similarly for $B$. Furthermore, any element of $A$ is\nalways less than any element of $B$ (See for detail).\n\nWith these two methods, one can construct many more examples of chains:\n\n1.  Take $\\mathbb{R}$, and form $A=\\mathbb{R}\\coprod \\lbrace a\\rbrace$.\n    Then $A$ is a chain with a top element. If we take\n    $B=\\lbrace b\\rbrace \\coprod A$, we get a chain with both a top and a\n    bottom element. In fact, $B$ is an example of a complete chain: a\n    chain such that every subset has a supremum and an infimum. Observe\n    that any finite chain is complete.\n\n2.  We can form $\\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}$ which is a set with $1$ as the\n    top element. We can also form\n    $\\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}\\coprod \\mathbb{N}$, which has neither top nor\n    bottom, or $\\mathbb{N}\\coprod \\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}$, which has both\n    a top and a bottom element, but is not complete, as $\\mathbb{N}$,\n    considered as a subset, has no top. Likewise,\n    $\\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}$ is bottomless.\n\nThe idea of joining two chains can be generalized. Let\n$\\lbrace A_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a family of chains indexed by $I$,\nitself a chain. We form $\\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i$ as follows: take the\ndisjoint union of $A_i$, which we also write as $\\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i$.\nThen $(a,i)\\le (b,j)$ iff either $i=j$ and $a\\le b$, or $i<j$.\n\nFor example, let $I=\\mathbb{R}$ and $A_i=\\mathbb{R}$, with $i\\in I$.\nThen $\\coprod_{i\\in I}A_i$ is a chain, whose total order is the\nlexicographic order on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. If we well-order $I=\\mathbb{R}$,\nthen $\\coprod_{i\\in I}A_i$ is another chain called the long line.\n\n### Chain homomorphisms {#chain-homomorphisms .unnumbered}\n\nLet $A,B$ be chains. A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is said to be a\n*chain homomorphism* if it is a poset homomorphism (it preserves order).\n$f(A)$ is the homomorphic image of $A$ in $B$. Two chains are\nhomomorphic if there is a chain homomorphism from one to another. A\nchain homomorphism is an embedding if it is one-to-one. If $A$ embeds in\n$B$, we write $A\\subseteq B$. A strict embedding is an embedding that is\nnot onto. If $A$ strictly embeds in $B$, we write $A\\subset B$. An onto\nembedding is also called an isomorphism. If $A$ is isomorphic to $B$, we\nwrite $A\\cong B$.\n\nSome properties:\n\n-   Two finite chains are isomorphic iff they have the same cardinality.\n\n-   Top and bottom elements are preserved by chain isomorphisms. In\n    other words, if $f:A\\to B$ is a chain isomorphism and if $a\\in A$ is\n    the top (bottom) element, then $f(a)$ is the top (bottom) element in\n    $B$.\n\n-   In addition, the properties of being well-ordered, dense, Dedekind\n    complete, and complete are all preserved under a chain isomorphism.\n\n-   $A\\subseteq A\\coprod B$. More generally\n    $A_i\\subseteq \\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i$.\n\n-   $(A\\coprod B)\\coprod C\\cong A\\coprod (B\\coprod C)$.\n\n-   If $k$ is the bottom element of $I$, and $A_k$ has a top element\n    $x$, then there is a chain homomorphism\n    $f:\\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i\\to A_k$ given by $f(a,i)=a$ if $i=k$ and\n    $f(a,i)=x$ if $i>k$.\n\n-   Dually, if $k$ is the top of $I$ and $A_k$ has a bottom $x$, then\n    there is a chain homomorphism $f:\\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i\\to A_k$ given\n    by $f(a,i)=a$ if $i=k$ and $f(a,i)=x$ if $i<k$.\n\n-   If $A_k$ has both a bottom $x$ and a top $y$, then we may define\n    $f:\\coprod_{i\\in I} A_i\\to A_k$ by $f(a,i)=a$ if $i=k$, $f(a,i)=x$\n    if $i<k$ and $f(a,i)=y$ if $k<i$.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-   $\\mathbf{n}\\subset \\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n-   $\\mathbf{n}\\coprod \\mathbf{m}\\cong \\mathbf{p}$ iff $p=m+n$ for any\n    non-negative integers $m,n$ and $p$.\n\n-   $\\mathbf{n}\\coprod \\mathbb{N}\\cong \\mathbb{N}$ for any non-negative\n    integer $n$.\n\n-   $\\mathbb{N}\\coprod \\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}\\ncong \\mathbb{N}^{\\partial}\\coprod\\mathbb{N}$.\n\n-   Let $I$ be the chain over $\\mathbb{R}$ under the usual order, and\n    $J$ the chain over $\\mathbb{R}$ under a well-ordering. Then\n    $\\coprod_{i\\in I}\\mathbb{R}\\ncong \\coprod_{j\\in J}\\mathbb{R}$.",
