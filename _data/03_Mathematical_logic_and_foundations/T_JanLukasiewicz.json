  "definition": "*Jan \u0141ukasiewicz* (1878 - 1956) Polish mathematician and logician mainly\nconcerned with logic in mathematics probably best known for the\nthree-valued logics, the Polish notation, the law of excluded middle and\nthe axiomatizations of much classical propositional logic. He studied at\nthe University of Lw\u00f3w, earning doctorates in mathematics and philosophy\nin 1902. In 1919 he was Minister of Education in Poland. After WWII, he\nwas exiled to Belgium. Arguably, the 3-valued logics named after him was\nthe first published report of a non-Boolean, or non-Chrysippean logic\n(with only two logic values, \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, in the Chrysippean\ncase). Subsequently, \u0141ukasiewicz logic algebras were constructed by\nGrigore Moisil in 1940-1945 to define \u2018nuances\u2019 in logics, or\nmany-valued logics, as well as 3-state control logic (electronic)\ncircuits. \u0141ukasiewicz-Moisil ($LM_n$) logic algebras were defined\naxiomatically after 1969 as n-valued logic algebra representations and\nextensions of the \u0141ukasiewcz (3-valued) logics; then, the universal\nproperties of were also investigated and reported in a series of recent\npublications. Recently, several modifications of [*$LM_n$-logic\nalgebras*]{} are under consideration as valid candidates for\nrepresentations of [*quantum logics*]{}, as well as for modeling\nnon-linear biodynamics in genetic \u2018nets\u2019 or networks, as well as in\nsingle-cell organisms, or in tumor growth.",
