  "definition": "The modal logic **S4** is the smallest normal modal logic containing the\nfollowing schemas:\n\n-   \\(T) $\\square A \\to A$, and\n\n-   \\(4) $\\square A \\to \\square \\square A$.\n\nIn , we show that T is valid in a frame iff the frame is reflexive.\n\n4 is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$ iff $\\mathcal{F}$ is transitive.\n\nFirst, suppose $\\mathcal{F}$ is a frame validating 4, with $w R u$ and\n$u R t$. Let $M$ be a model with $V(p)=\\lbrace v\\mid w R v \\rbrace$,\nwhere $p$ a propositional variable. So $\\models_w \\square p$. By\nassumption, we have $\\models_w \\square p \\to \\square \\square p$. Then\n$\\models_w \\square \\square p$. This means $\\models_v \\square p$ for all\n$v$ such that $w R v$. Since $w R u$, $\\models_u \\square p$, which means\n$\\models_s p$ for all $s$ such that $u R s$. Since $u R t$, we have\n$\\models_t p$, or $t\\in V(p)$, or $w R t$. Hence $R$ is transitive.\n\nConversely, let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a transitive frame, $M$ a model based\non $\\mathcal{F}$, and $w$ any world in $M$. Suppose\n$\\models_w \\square A$. We want to show $\\models_w \\square \\square A$, or\nfor all $u$ with $w R u$, we have $\\models_u \\square A$, or for all $u$\nwith $w R u$ and all $t$ with $u R t$, we have $\\models_t A$. If $w R u$\nand $u R t$, $w R t$ since $R$ is transitive. Then $\\models_t A$ by\nassumption. Therefore, $\\models_w \\square A \\to \\square \\square A$.\n\nAs a result,\n\n**S4** is sound in the class of preordered frames.\n\nSince any theorem in **S4** is deducible from a finite sequence\nconsisting of tautologies, which are valid in any frame, instances of T,\nwhich are valid in reflexive frames, instances of 4, which are valid in\ntransitive frames by the proposition above, and applications of modus\nponens and necessitation, both of which preserve validity in any frame,\nwhence the result.\n\nIn addition, using the canonical model of **S4**, which is preordered,\nwe have\n\n**S4** is complete in the class of serial frames.\n\nSince **S4** contains T, its canonical frame $\\mathcal{F}_{\\textbf{S4}}$\nis reflexive. We next show that the canonical frame\n$\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ of any consistent normal logic $\\Lambda$\ncontaining the schema 4 must be transitive. So suppose $w R_{\\Lambda} u$\nand $u R_{\\Lambda} v$. If\n$A \\in \\Delta_w:=\\lbrace B\\mid \\square B\\in w\\rbrace$, then\n$\\square A\\in w$, or $\\square \\square A \\in w$ by modus ponens on 4 and\nthe fact that $w$ is closed under modus ponens. Hence\n$\\square A \\in \\Delta_w$, or $\\square A \\in u$ since $w R_{\\Lambda} u$,\nor $A \\in \\Delta_u$, or $A\\in v$ since $u R_{\\Lambda} v$. As a result,\n$w R_{\\Lambda} v$, and therefore $\\mathcal{F}_{\\textbf{S4}}$ is a\npreordered frame.\n\nBy a proper translation, one can map intuitionistic propositional logic\nPL$_i$ into **S4**, so that a wff of PL$_i$ is a theorem iff its\ntranslate is a theorem of **S4**.",
