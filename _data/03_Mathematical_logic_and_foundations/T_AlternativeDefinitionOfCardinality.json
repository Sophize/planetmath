  "definition": "The concept of cardinality comes from the notion of equinumerosity of\nsets. To define the cardinality $|A|$ of a set $A$, one desirable\nproperty is that $A$ is equinumerous to $B$ precisely when $|A|=|B|$.\nThe first attempt, due to Frege and Russel, is to define a relation\n$\\sim$ on the class $V$ of sets so that $A\\sim B$ iff there is a\nbijection from $A$ to $B$. This relation is an equivalence relation on\n$V$. Then we can define $|A|$ as the equivalence class containing the\nset $A$. However, $|A|$ is not a set, so we can\u2019t do much with $|A|$ in\nZF.\n\nThe second attempt, due to Von Neumann, defines $|A|$ to be the smallest\nordinal ${\\operatorname{card}}(A)$ equinumerous to $A$. Now,\n${\\operatorname{card}}(A)$ exists if $A$ is well-orderable. But in\ngeneral, we do not know if $A$ is well-orderable unless the\nwell-ordering principle is applied, which is just another form of the\naxiom of choice. Thus, this definition depends on AC, and, in everyday\nmathematical usage (which assumes ZFC), $|A|:={\\operatorname{card}}(A)$\nsuffices.\n\nThe third way, due to Scott, of looking at $|A|$, without AC, is to\nmodify the first attempt somewhat, so that $|A|$ is a set. Recall that\nthe rank of a set $A$ is the least ordinal $\\alpha$ such that\n$A\\subseteq V_{\\alpha}$ in the cumulative hierarchy. A set having a rank\nis said to be *grounded*. By the axiom of foundation, every set is\ngrounded. For any set $A$, let\n$R(A):=\\lbrace \\rho(B)\\mid B\\sim A\\rbrace$. Then $R(A)$, as a class of\nordinals, has a least element $r(A)$. So $r(A)\\le \\rho(A)$. Next, we\ndefine (borrowing the terminology used in the first reference below)\n$${\\operatorname{kard}}(A):=\\lbrace B \\mid B\\sim A\\mbox{ and }\\rho(B)=r(A)\\rbrace,$$\nand set $|A|:={\\operatorname{kard}}(A)$. Since every element in\n${\\operatorname{kard}}(A)$ is a subset of $V_{r(A)}$,\n${\\operatorname{kard}}(A)\\subseteq V_{r(A)^+}$, so that $|A|$ is a set.\nThis method is known as Scott\u2019s trick. It can also be used in defining\nother isomorphism types on sets. It is easy to see that $|A|=|B|$ iff\n$A\\sim B$. However, with this definition,\n${\\operatorname{kard}}(n)\\ne n$ in general, where $n$ is a natural\nnumber.\n\nNevertheless, it is known that every finite set is well-orderable, and\nso we come to the fourth definition of the cardinality of a set: given a\nset $A$: $$|A|:= \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n{\\operatorname{card}}(A) \\mbox{ if }A\\mbox{ is well-orderable},\\\\\n{\\operatorname{kard}}(A) \\mbox{ otherwise }.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ The one big advantage of this definition is clear: it does not\nrequire AC, and with AC, it is identical to the second definition above.\nAt the same time, it also resolves the conflict with our intuitive\nnotion about cardinality: the cardinality of a finite set is the number\nof elements in the set. However, the one big disadvantage in this\ndefinition is that we do not have $A\\sim |A|$ in general (of course, $A$\nis infinite). There is no way, without AC, to find a definition of\n$|A|$, such that $A\\sim B$ iff $|A|=|B|$, and $A\\sim |A|$ at the same\ntime.\n\n[8]{} H.
