  "definition": "Let $A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ be an automaton. Recall that a transition\nof $A$ is a triple written in the form\n$$p \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\longrightarrow} q,$$ where $q$ is a next state of\nthe configuration $(p,\\alpha)$. In other words, $q\\in \\delta(p,\\alpha)$.\nHere, $\\alpha$ is a symbol in $\\Sigma$.\n\nThe notion of transitions can be generalized so that\n$p\\stackrel{a}{\\longrightarrow} q$ iff $q\\in \\delta(p,a)$, where\n$a\\in \\Sigma^*$. The definition of the extended transition function\n$\\delta$ dictates that $p\\stackrel{\\lambda}{\\longrightarrow} q$ implies\n$p=q$. This means that if the empty word is fed into an automaton at any\nstate $p$, the next state stays the same. In other words, the automaton\ndoes nothing.\n\nAn $\\epsilon$-transition, informally, is a transition in an \u201cautomaton\u201d\nthat changes the initial state when an empty word is read. This means,\nnotationally, that $p\\stackrel{\\lambda}{\\longrightarrow} q$ where $p$ is\nnot necessarily $q$. The double quotes around the word automaton is to\nsignify the fact that when $\\epsilon$-transitions are considered, the\nmachine is no longer an automaton strictly speaking. The \u201c$\\epsilon$\u201d\nhere refers to the empty word $\\lambda$, which is sometimes denoted by\n$\\epsilon$.\n\nThe consequence of adding $\\epsilon$-transitions is that the set of next\nstates is potentially enlarged whenever a word is read, because at any\npoint during the reading, a next state could result from an alphabet, or\nit could come from any of the next states by inserting several empty\nwords after the alphabet. Outwardly, the insertions of empty words into\na word does not change the word itself. However, the possibility of\naccepting the word is increased. So the question is: does this\n\u201cautomaton with $\\epsilon$-transitoins\u201d offers more computing power than\na traditional automaton? Interestingly, the answer is no, and we will\ndemonstrate this fact in this article.\n\nFirst, we need to define formally what $\\epsilon$-transitions and\nautomata with $\\epsilon$-transitions are.\n\n**Definitions**. There are several concepts that need to be formalized:\n\n1.  An *automaton with $\\epsilon$-transitions*, or\n    *$\\epsilon$-automaton* for short, is a sextuple\n    $$E:=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F,\\epsilon)$$ such that\n    $\\epsilon\\notin \\Sigma$, and\n    $E_{\\epsilon}:=(S,\\Sigma_{\\epsilon}, \\delta,I,F)$, where\n    $\\Sigma_{\\epsilon}:=\\Sigma\\cup \\lbrace \\epsilon\\rbrace$, is an\n    automaton, called the automaton *associated with* $E$.\n\n2.  An *$\\epsilon$-transition* is a transition of $E_{\\epsilon}$ of the\n    form $p\\stackrel{\\epsilon}{\\longrightarrow} q$.\n\n3.  We define the language $L(E)$ accepted by an $\\epsilon$-automaton\n    $E$ to be the set of all words in $\\Sigma^*$ that can be obtained\n    from words accepted by $E_{\\epsilon}$ by deleting any occurrences of\n    $\\epsilon$. Formally, $$L(E):=h(L(E_{\\epsilon})),$$ where\n    $h:\\Sigma_{\\epsilon}^*\\to \\Sigma^*$ is the monoid homomorphism given\n    by $h|\\Sigma=1$ and $h(\\epsilon)=\\lambda$. It is easy to see, by\n    induction, that\n    $$h(a)=\\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\cdots \\alpha_n \\qquad \\mbox{ iff } \\qquad a= \\epsilon^{i_0}\\alpha_1\\epsilon^{i_1}\\alpha_2 \\epsilon^{i_2}\\cdots \\epsilon^{i_{n-1}}\\alpha_n \\epsilon^{i_n},$$\n    where $\\alpha_j\\in \\Sigma$, $j=1,2,\\ldots,n$.\n\n4.  We say that an $\\epsilon$-automaton $E$ is *equivalent* to an\n    automaton $A$ if $L(E)=L(A)$. It is not hard to see that every\n    $\\epsilon$-automaton is equivalent to an automaton ().\n\n**Remark**. $\\epsilon$-transitions are useful in proving the two\nproperties of regular languages: 1. if two languages are regular, so is\ntheir juxtaposition (see proof ), and 2. if a language is regular, so is\nits Kleene star (see proof ).",
