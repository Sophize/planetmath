  "definition": "A *Hilbert system* is a style (formulation) of deductive system that\nemphasizes the role played by the axioms in the system. Typically, a\nHilbert system has many axiom schemes, but only a few, sometimes one,\nrules of inference. As such, a Hilbert system is also called an *axiom\nsystem*. Below we list three examples of axiom systems in mathematical\nlogic:\n\n-   (intuitionistic propositional logic)\n\n    -   axiom schemes:\n\n        1.  $A\\to (B\\to A)$\n\n        2.  $(A\\to (B\\to C))\\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$\n\n        3.  $A\\to A\\vee B$\n\n        4.  $B\\to A\\vee B$\n\n        5.  $(A\\to C)\\to ((B\\to C)\\to (A\\vee B\\to C))$\n\n        6.  $A\\wedge B \\to A$\n\n        7.  $A\\wedge B \\to B$\n\n        8.  $A \\to (B\\to (A\\wedge B))$\n\n        9.  $\\perp \\to A$\n\n    -   rule of inference: (modus ponens): from $A\\to B$ and $A$, we may\n        infer $B$\n\n-   (classical predicate logic without equality)\n\n    -   axiom schemes:\n\n        1.  all of the axiom schemes above, and\n\n        2.  law of double negation: $\\neg (\\neg A) \\to A$\n\n        3.  $\\forall x A \\to A[x/y]$\n\n        4.  $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (A \\to \\forall y B[x/y])$\n\n        In the last two axiom schemes, we require that $y$ is free for\n        $x$ in $A$, and in the last axiom scheme, we also require that\n        $x$ does not occur free in $A$.\n\n    -   rules of inference:\n\n        1.  modus ponens, and\n\n        2.  generalization: from $A$, we may infer $\\forall y A[x/y]$,\n            where $y$ is free for $x$ in $A$\n\n-   (S4 modal propositional logic)\n\n    -   axiom schemes:\n\n        1.  all of the axiom schemes in intuitionistic propositional\n            logic, as well as the law of double negation, and\n\n        2.  Axiom K, or the normality axiom:\n            $\\square (A\\to B) \\to (\\square A \\to \\square B)$\n\n        3.  Axiom T: $\\square A \\to A$\n\n        4.  Axiom 4: $\\square A \\to \\square (\\square A)$\n\n    -   rules of inference:\n\n        1.  modus ponens, and\n\n        2.  necessitation: from $A$, we may infer $\\square A$\n\nwhere $A,B,C$ above are well-formed formulas, $x,y$ are individual\nvariables, and $\\to,\\vee,\\wedge$ are binary, $\\square$ unary, and\n$\\perp$ nullary logical connectives in the respective logical systems.\nThe connective $\\neg$ may be defined as $\\neg A:=A\\to \\perp$ for any\nformula $A$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   Hilbert systems need not be unique for a given logical system. For\n    example, see .\n\n-   For a given logical system, every Hilbert system is deductively\n    equivalent to a Gentzen system: for any axiom $A$ in a Hilbert\n    system $H$, convert it to the sequent $\\Rightarrow A$, and for any\n    rule: from $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ we may deduce $B$, convert it to the\n    rule: from $\\Delta\\Rightarrow A_1,\\ldots,A_n$, we may infer\n    $\\Delta \\Rightarrow B$.\n\n-   Since axioms are semantically valid statements, the use of Hilbert\n    systems is more about deriving other semantically valid statements,\n    or theorems, and less about the syntactical analysis of deductions\n    themselves. Outside of structural proof theory, deductive systems a\n    la Hilbert style are used almost exclusively everywhere in\n    mathematics.\n\n[7]{} H.
