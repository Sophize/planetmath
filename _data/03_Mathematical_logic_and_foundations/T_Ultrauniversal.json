  "definition": "Let $T$ be a first order theory. A model $M$ of $T$ is said to be an\n*ultra-universal model* of $T$ iff for every model $A$ of $T$ there\nexists and ultra-power of $M$ into which $A$ can be embedded. [@VC; @UM]\n\nIf $T$ has an ultra-universal model it is referred to as an\n*ultra-universal theory*. The class of models of an ultra-universal\ntheory is called an *ultra-universal class*. If $T$ is an\nultra-universal theory with elementary class $K$ and ultra-universal\nmodel $M$ then $M$ is said to be *ultra-universal in* $K$. [@UM]\n\n### Characterizations\n\nUltra-universal classes are precisely the non-empty elementary classes\nhaving the joint embedding property. [@UM]\n\nUltra-universal models can be characterized in terms of universal or\nexistential sentences:\n\nLet $T$ be theory and let $M$ be a model of $T$. The following are\nequivalent: [@UM]\n\n1.  $M$ is an ultra-universal model of $T$\n\n2.  Every universal sentence holding in $M$ holds in all models of $T$\n\n3.  Every existential sentence holding in some model of $T$ holds in $M$\n\nA theory $T$ is ultra-universal iff it is consistent and for all\nuniversal sentences $\\phi$ and $\\psi$, $T\\vdash\\phi\\vee\\psi$ implies\n$T\\vdash\\phi$ or $T\\vdash\\psi$. [@UM]\n\nA complete consistent theory is always ultra-universal. More generally\nthe set of universal sentences $\\Sigma$ of a complete consistent theory\n$T$ is always an ultra-universal theory - a model of $T$ is an\nultra-universal model of $\\Sigma$. Ultra-universal theories are\nprecisely those theories $T$ which are consistent and can be extended to\na complete consistent theory without introducing any universal sentences\nthat are not deducible from $T$. [@UM]\n\nIn terms of the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra for a first order language\n$L$, a theory $T$ in $L$ is ultra-universal iff the filter $F$ that it\ngenerates in the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is proper and can be extended\nto an ultrafilter $U$ such that $F \\cap A = U \\cap A$ where $A$ is the\nsub-lattice of universal sentences. Moreover $T$ is ultra-universal iff\n$F \\cap A$ is a prime proper filter in $A$. Thus ultra-universal\ntheories correspond to prime proper filters in the bounded distributive\nlattice of universal sentences. [@UM]\n\n### Examples\n\n-   Any infinite partition lattice is ultra-universal in the variety of\n    lattices [@VC]\n\n-   Any infinite symmetric group is ultra-universal in the variety of\n    groups [@UM]\n\n-   The monoid of functions defined on an infinite set is\n    ultra-universal in the variety of monoids [@UM]\n\n-   The semigroup reduct of the monoid of functions defined on an\n    infinite set is ultra-universal in the varierty of semigroups [@UM]\n\n-   The power set interior (or closure) algebra on Cantor\u2019s discontinuum\n    or on a denumerable co-finite topological space is ultra-universal\n    in the variety of interior (or closure) algebras [@IA]\n\n-   The product of all fintely generated substructures (up to\n    isomorphism) of members of a factor embeddable universal Horn class\n    (in particular a factor embeddable variety of algebraic structures)\n    is ultra-universal in the class. [@UM]\n\n-   More generally, any model in an elementary class having the property\n    that all fintely generated substructures of the class are embeddable\n    in it, is ultra-universal in the class.
