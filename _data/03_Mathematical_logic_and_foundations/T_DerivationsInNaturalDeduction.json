  "definition": "Derivations, or deductions, for natural deduction systems, unlike the\naxiom systems, which are finite sequences of well-formed formulas\n(wff\u2019s) in a logic, are finite tress of wff\u2019s. More precisely, they are\nrooted tress whose vertices are labeled by wff\u2019s of the logic. For\nexample,\n$$\\pstree[treemode=U,radius=3pt,levelsep=7ex]{\\Tc{3pt}~[tnpos=b,tndepth=0pt,radius=4pt]{A\\to A}}\n{\n\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=r]{A}}\n{\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=r]{A\\land A}}{\\TC~[tnpos=l]{A}\\TC~[tnpos=r]{A}}}\n}$$ is a labeled rooted tree, whose root is labeled by the wff\n$A \\to A$. In natural deduction, the trees are presented a little bit\ndifferently, replacing each edge with a horizontal bar separating the\nneighboring vertices. Thus, the tree above looks like\n\nDerivations are defined recursively: from atomic formulas as\nsingle-vertex trees via rules of inference of the system. To see how\nthis is done exactly, recall that a rule of inference generally takes\nthe following form:\n$$\\infer[R]{Y}{X_1 \\quad \\cdots \\quad X_i \\quad \\cdots \\quad \\infer*{X_j}{[A_j]} \\quad \\cdots \\quad X_n}$$\nwhere $R$ is the name of the rule, and the $X_k$\u2019s, $A_k$\u2019s, and $Y$ are\nwff\u2019s of the logic. Each $X_k$ is a *premise*, and $Y$ is the\n*conclusion*. Some of the premises (like $X_j$ above) have optional\n*assumptions* ($A_j$) which can be *cancelled* or *discharged* once the\nconclusion is reached. Just exactly what \u201ccancelled\u201d or \u201cdischarged\u201d\nmeans will be clear shortly.\n\nNow we are ready for the formal definition of derivations.\n\n**Definition**. A labeled rooted tree over a natural deduction system is\na rooted tree whose labels are of the form $A$ or $[A]$, where $A$ is a\nwff of the logical system.\n\n**Definition**. The set $\\mathbb{D}$ of *derivations* of a natural\ndeduction system the smallest set of labeled rooted trees over the wff\u2019s\nof system, such that\n\n1.  for each propositional variable $p$, a one-vertex tree with label\n    $p$ is in $\\mathbb{D}$\n\n2.  for every inference rule $R$ where\n\n    -   $X_1,\\ldots, X_n$ are premises\n\n    -   $Y$ is the conclusion\n\n    -   a subset $\\mathcal{X}$ (may be empty) of the premises where each\n        $X\\in \\mathcal{X}$ has an optional assumption $A_X$ that can be\n        discharged when conclusion $Y$ is reached\n\n    if $T_1,\\ldots, T_n$ are in $\\mathdd{D}$ where each $X_i$ is the\n    label of the root of $T_i$, then the rooted tree $T$, obtained by\n\n    1.  transforming each of the trees $T$ whose root has label\n        $X\\in \\mathcal{X}$ to a tree such that some (or none) of the\n        leaves in $T$ with label $A_X$ are converted to leaves with\n        label $[A_X]$,\n\n    2.  then combining the resulting trees, as well as the rest of the\n        other trees by joining their roots to a new vertex as the root\n        of $T$, with label is $Y$\n\n    is also in $\\mathbb{D}$. Graphically, $T$ can be represented\n\nFor example, using the following rule of inference in classical\npropositional logic, called $\\to I$\n$$\\infer[\\to I]{A\\to B}{\\infer*{B}{[A]}}$$ we have the following\nderivations\n$$\\infer{p\\to q}{q}\\qquad \\qquad \\infer{q\\to (p\\to q)}{\\infer{p\\to q}{[q]}}$$\nThe first one is a derivation because $q$ is a propositional variable by\n$(a)$, and since the rule does not require the presence of an assumption\n(it is optional), the whole tree is a derivation by $(b)$. As a result,\nby $(b)$ once more, the second one is also a derivation, where the label\n$q$ of the leaf (top vertex) has been changed to $[q]$.\n\nFrom now on, if no confusion arises, the vertices of a derivation are\nidentified with their labels.\n\n**Definition**. Given a derivation $T$ in a natural deduction logical\nsystem, the *assumptions* of $T$ are leaves of the form $A$, and\n*discharged assumptions* of $T$ if they are of the form $[A]$. The\n*conclusion* of $T$ is the root of $T$. If $\\Sigma$ is a set of wff\u2019s\nand $A$ a wff, we write $$\\Sigma \\vdash A$$ if there is a derivation $T$\nwhose assumptions are elements of $\\Sigma$, and whose conclusion is $A$.\nWe say that $A$ is *derivable from* $\\Sigma$. The symbol $\\vdash$ is the\n*derivability relation* between sets of wff\u2019s and wff\u2019s. We say that $A$\nis a *theorem* (of the logical system) if it is derivable from the empty\nset, and write $$\\vdash A.$$ In other words, $A$ is a theorem if there\nis a derivation of $A$ whose assumptions are all discharged. For\nexample, from the two derivations above, we see that $q \\vdash p\\to q$\nand $\\vdash q\\to (p\\to q)$.",
