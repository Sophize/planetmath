  "definition": "The modal logic **B** (for Brouwerian) is the smallest normal modal\nlogic containing the following schemas:\n\n-   \\(T) $\\square A \\to A$, and\n\n-   \\(B) $A \\to \\square \\diamond A$.\n\nIn , we show that T is valid in a frame iff the frame is reflexive.\n\nB is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$ iff $\\mathcal{F}$ is symmetric.\n\nFirst, suppose B is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$, and $w R u$. Let $M$\nbe a model based on $\\mathcal{F}$, with $V(p)=\\lbrace w\\rbrace$, $p$ a\npropositional variable. Since $w\\in V(p)$, $\\models_w p$, and\n$\\models_w p \\to \\square \\diamond p$ by assumption,\n$\\models_v \\diamond p$ for all $v$ such that $w R v$. In particular,\n$\\models_u \\diamond p$, which means there is a $t$ such that $u R t$ and\n$\\models_t p$. But this means that $t\\in V(p)$, so $t=w$, whence\n$u R w$, and $R$ is symmetric.\n\nConversely, let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a symmetric frame, $M$ a model based on\n$\\mathcal{F}$, and $w$ a world in $M$. Suppose $\\models_w A$. If\n$\\not \\models_w \\square \\diamond A$, then there is a $u$ such that\n$w R u$, with $\\not \\models_u \\diamond A$. This mean for no $t$ with\n$u R t$, we have $\\models_t A$. Since $R$ is symmetric, $u R w$, so\n$\\not \\models_w A$, a contradiction. Therefore,\n$\\models_w \\square \\diamond A$, and $\\models_w A \\to \\square \\diamond A$\nas a result.\n\nAs a result,\n\n**B** is sound in the class of symmetric frames.\n\nSince any theorem in **B** is deducible from a finite sequence\nconsisting of tautologies, which are valid in any frame, instances of B,\nwhich are valid in symmetric frames by the proposition above, and\napplications of modus ponens and necessitation, both of which preserve\nvalidity in any frame, whence the result.\n\nIn addition, using the canonical model of **B**, we have\n\n**B** is complete in the class of reflexive, symmetric frames.\n\nSince **B** contains T, its canonical frame $\\mathcal{F}_{\\textbf{B}}$\nis reflexive. We next show that any consistent normal logic $\\Lambda$\ncontaining the schema B is symmetric. Suppose $w R_{\\Lambda} u$. We want\nto show that $u R_{\\Lambda} w$, or that\n$\\Delta_u:=\\lbrace B \\mid \\square B\\in u\\rbrace \\subseteq w$. It is then\nenough to show that if $A \\notin w$, then $A\\notin \\Delta_u$. If\n$A\\notin w$, $\\neg A \\in w$ because $w$ is maximal, or\n$\\square \\diamond \\neg A \\in w$ by modus ponens on B, or\n$\\square \\neg \\square A \\in w$ by the substitution theorem on\n$A\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\neg A$, or $\\neg \\square A \\in \\Delta_w$ by the\ndefinition of $\\Delta_w$, or $\\neg \\square A \\in u$ since\n$w R_{\\Lambda} u$, or $\\square A \\notin u$, since $u$ is maximal, or\n$A\\notin \\Delta_u$ by the definition of $\\Delta_u$. So $R_{\\Lambda}$ is\nsymmetric, and $R_{\\textbf{B}}$ is both reflexive and symmetric.",
