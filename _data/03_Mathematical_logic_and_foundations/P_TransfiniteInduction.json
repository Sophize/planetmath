  "statement": "Suppose $\\Phi(\\alpha)$ is a property defined for every ordinal $\\alpha$,\nthe principle of *transfinite induction* states that in the case where\nfor every $\\alpha$, if the fact that $\\Phi(\\beta)$ is true for every\n$\\beta<\\alpha$ implies that $\\Phi(\\alpha)$ is true, then $\\Phi(\\alpha)$\nis true for every ordinal $\\alpha$. Formally :\n\n$$\\forall\\alpha(\\forall\\beta(\\beta<\\alpha{\\Rightarrow}\\Phi(\\beta)){\\Rightarrow}\\Phi(\\alpha)){\\Rightarrow}\\forall\\alpha(\\Phi(\\alpha))$$\n\nThe principle of transfinite induction is very similar to the principle\nof finite induction, except that it is stated in terms of the whole\nclass of the ordinals.",
