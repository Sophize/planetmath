  "statement": "Let $f$ and $g$ be invertible functions such that their composition\n$f \\circ g$ is well defined. Then $f \\circ g$ is invertible and\n$$(f \\circ g)^{-1}=g^{-1} \\circ f^{-1}.$$\n\nBefore proving this theorem, it should be noted that some students\nencounter this result long before they are introduced to formal proof.\nFortunately, there is an intuitive way to think about this theorem:\nThink of the function $g$ as putting on one\u2019s socks and the function $f$\nas putting on one\u2019s shoes. Then $f \\circ g$ denotes the process of\nputting one one\u2019s socks, then putting on one\u2019s shoes. (Recall that\nfunction composition works from right to left.) Note that\n$(f \\circ g)^{-1}$ refers to the reverse process of $f \\circ g$, which\nis taking off one\u2019s shoes (which is $f^{-1}$) followed by taking off\none\u2019s socks (which is $g^{-1}$).\n\nDue to the intuitive argument given above, the theorem is referred to as\nthe *socks and shoes rule*. This name is a mnemonic device which reminds\npeople that, in order to obtain the inverse of a composition of\nfunctions, the original functions have to be undone in the opposite\norder.\n\nNow for the formal proof.\n\nLet $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets such that $g \\colon A \\to B$ and\n$f \\colon B \\to C$. Then the following two equations must be shown to\nhold:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(g^{-1} \\circ f^{-1}) \\circ (f \\circ g)=\\hbox{id}_A\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(f \\circ g) \\circ (g^{-1} \\circ f^{-1})=\\hbox{id}_C\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNote that $\\hbox{id}_X$ denotes the identity function on the set $X$.\n\nThe two equations given above follow easily from the fact that function\ncomposition is associative.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(g^{-1} \\circ f^{-1}) \\circ (f \\circ g) & =g^{-1} \\circ ((f^{-1} \\circ f) \\circ g) \\\\\n                                        & =g^{-1} \\circ (\\hbox{id}_B \\circ g) \\\\\n                                        & =g^{-1} \\circ g \\\\\n                                        & =\\hbox{id}_A\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(f \\circ g) \\circ (g^{-1} \\circ f^{-1}) & =f \\circ ((g \\circ g^{-1}) \\circ f^{-1}) \\\\\n                                        & =f \\circ (\\hbox{id}_B \\circ f^{-1}) \\\\\n                                        & =f \\circ f^{-1} \\\\\n                                        & =\\hbox{id}_C \\qedhere\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe socks and shoes rule has a natural generalization:\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer and $f_1,\\dots,f_n$ be invertible\nfunctions such that their composition $f_1\\circ\\dots\\circ f_n$ is well\ndefined. Then $f_1\\circ\\dots\\circ f_n$ is invertible and\n$$(f_1\\circ\\dots\\circ f_n)^{-1}={f_n}^{-1}\\circ\\dots\\circ{f_1}^{-1}.$$\n\nA sketch of a proof is as follows: Using induction on $n$, the socks and\nshoes rule can be applied with $f=f_1\\circ\\dots\\circ f_{n-1}$ and\n$g=f_n$.",
