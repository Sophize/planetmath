  "definition": "Given a set $\\Sigma$, a *word* (or a string) over $\\Sigma$ is a\njuxtaposition (variously called concatenation or multiplication) of a\nfinite number of elements in $\\Sigma$. The juxtaposition is taken as an\nassociative binary operation on $\\Sigma$. A word with zero number of\nelements is called an *empty word*, typically denoted by $\\lambda$ or\n$\\epsilon$. The set of words over $\\Sigma$ is denoted $\\Sigma^*$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  If $\\Sigma = \\lbrace a,b,c,\\ldots, x,y,z\\rbrace$, the English\n    alphabet written in the lower case, then \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cmathematics\u201d,\n    \u201cfasluiwh\u201d are all words (without the double quotes) over $\\Sigma$,\n    where as \u201cPlanetMath\u201d is not, because it contains upper case\n    letters, which are not in $\\Sigma$.\n\n2.  Let $\\Sigma=\\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,=\\rbrace$. Then \u201c$12$\u201d,\n    \u201c$0345$\u201d, \u201c$9+3$\u201d, \u201c$87=123$\u201d, \u201c$++231++$\u201d, \u201c$6+7=13$\u201d, \u201c$7=$\u201d are\n    also words over $\\Sigma$.\n\n3.  The notion of words is used extensively in group theory. The\n    juxtaposition here is the group multiplication, as the\n    multiplication is associative. In other words, if $g_1,g_2,...,g_m$\n    are elements in $G$ then we can form the word\n    $w=g_1g_2\\cdots g_m\\in G$. For example, in the free group\n    $\\langle a,b|\\quad\\rangle$ a word could be the commutator\n    $[a,b]=aba^{-1}b^{-1}$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   $\\Sigma^*$ is a monoid with juxtaposition as the monoid\n    multiplication, and $\\lambda$, the empty word, as the multiplicative\n    identity.\n\n-   For any element $a$ in $\\Sigma$, define $a^0=\\lambda$, and\n    $a^{n+1}=a^na$ for non-negative integers $n$. Then $a^{n+m}=a^na^m$\n    since juxtaposition is associative.\n\n-   Words, by definition, are finite in length. This notion can be\n    generalized: an *infinite word*, or more precisely, a\n    *$\\omega$-word*, over an alphabet $\\Sigma$ is just a function from\n    $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\Sigma$. The set of all words over $\\Sigma$, finite\n    or infinite, is $\\Sigma^* \\cup \\Sigma^{\\mathbb{N}}$, and is denoted\n    by $\\Sigma^{\\infty}$ or $\\Sigma^{\\omega}$.\n\n### Subwords {#subwords .unnumbered}\n\nA word $u$ is called a *subword* of $v$ if $v=xuy$, for some words $x$\nand $y$ (may be empty words). If $u$ is a subword of $v$, we also say\nthat $u$ *occurs in* $v$, or that $v$ *contains* $u$. For example,\n\u201cmath\u201d is a subword of \u201cmathematics\u201d.\n\nGiven the equation $v=xuy$, we call the triple $(x,u,y)$ an *occurrence*\nof $u$ in $v$. The collection of occurrences of $u$ in $v$ is denoted\n$O(u,v)$. The *number of occurrences* of $u$ in $v$ defined as the\ncardinality of $O(u,v)$, and written $|u|_v$. The *position of\noccurrence* $(x,u,y)$ of $u$ in $v$ is the length of $x$ plus $1$.\n\nFor example, the number of occurrences of subword $a^3$ in $a^3ba^5c$ is\n$4$, since\n$$O(a^3,a^3ba^5c)=\\lbrace (\\lambda,a^3,ba^5c),(a^3b,a^3,a^2c), (a^3ba, a^3, ac), (a^3ba^2,a^3,c)\\rbrace.$$\nThe positions of these occurrences are $1,5,6$, and $7$, respectively.\n\n### Generating Words using Rules {#generating-words-using-rules .unnumbered}\n\nSome of the words in the second example above, such as \u201c$++231++$\u201d and\n\u201c$7=$\u201d, do not make any mathematical sense. The way to define words that\nmake sense is through a process called definition by recursion. First,\nwe declare that certain words over $\\Sigma$ are sensible. Then, we have\na set of rules or a grammar that dictates how new sensible words can be\nformed from the old ones. Any word that can be formed from the old words\nby these rules in a finite number of steps is called sensible.\n\nIn the last example, we could declare that all symbols $0,1,\\ldots,9$\nare sensible words. To form new sensible words, we have the rules:\n\n1.  if $a,b$ do not contain either $+$ or $=$, then $ab$ is a sensible\n    word;\n\n2.  if a two sensible words $a,b$ do not contain the symbol $=$, then\n    $a+b$ and $a=b$ are sensible words;\n\n3.  the only sensible words are the initially declared sensible words\n    and those that can be formed by the previous two rules.\n\nIt is not hard to see based on the initially declared sensible words and\nthe rules has one of the forms\n\n-   $a$\n\n-   $a_1+a_2+\\cdots +a_n$\n\n-   $a_1+a_2+\\cdots + a_n = b_1+b_2+\\cdots + b_m$.\n\nwhere $a,a_i,b_j$ are words without any occurrence of $+$ and $=$, over\n$\\Sigma$. As a result, we see that all words in the previous example are\nsensible (whether they are right or wrong), except \u201c++231++\u201d and \u201c7=\u201d,\nsince they are not in any one of the forms specified above. Note that\nthe third rule above ensures that \u201c++231++\u201d and \u201c7=\u201d are not sensible.\nWithout it, we would be unable to say for sure if these words are\nsensible or not.\n\nGenerally, any collection of words is called a *language*. The\ncollection of all sensible words described above is called *the language\ngenerated by* $0,\\ldots,9$ under the rules above. In logic, one calls\nthese sensible words *well-formed formulas*, or *formulas* or *wff* for\nshort.",
