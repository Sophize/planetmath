  "definition": "*Reductio ad Absurdum* is a process of inference by means of which one\ncan derive a proposition $\\neg X$ from the fact the the assumption of\n$X$ leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe underlying ideia is the following: if a contradiction can be deduced\nfrom a proposition $X$ then $X$ can not be true and one can therefore\nassert $\\neg X$. It is a useful method to derive negative statements.\nThe hypothesis from which the contradiction is derived is known as \u201cthe\nreductio\u2019s hypothesis\u201d.\n\nIn Gentzen\u2019s system of natural deduction the reductio\u2019s hypotheses\ndiffers from the other hypotheses by the fact that is not included in\nthe set of premisses on which the conclusion depends and thus behaves\nlike the assumption of a conditional proof.\n\nAssume that one has as hypothesis $$x_1 \\to \\neg x_1$$ and one aims at\nderiving $$\\neg x_1.$$\n\nUsing *Reductio ad Absurdum* one can assume $x_1$ as the reductio\u2019s\nhypothesis and therefore by *Modus Ponens* one gets $\\neg x_1$. Thus one\nhas $$x_1 \\wedge \\neg x_1$$ which is the contradiction that one is led\nto. Therefore one can assert $\\neg x_1$.\n\nThe derivation looks liked this:\n\n>   ------ ----- ---------------------- -----------------------\n>   1      (1)   $x_1 \\to \\neg x_1$     Hyp.\n>   2      (2)   $x_1$                  Red. Hyp.\n>   1, 2   (3)   $\\neg x_1$             1, 2, MP\n>   1, 2   (4)   $x_1 \\land \\neg x_1$   1, 2, 3, $\\land$-Int.\n>   1      (5)   $\\neg x_1$             Red. *ad* Abs.\n>   ------ ----- ---------------------- -----------------------\n>\nIn the *Prior Analytics*, I, 23 (41-26) Aristotle compares the method of\nthe *Reductio ad Absurdum*, used by Euclid in his proof that the Square\nroot of 2 is irrational with his own method of the *Reductio ad\nImpossibile*, used in the reduction of the syllogisms $\\bf Baroco$ and\n$\\bf Bocardo$ to the First Figure.\n\nFor these two syllogisms Aristotle\u2019s problem consists in the fact that\nboth have a type 0 premiss, which converts neither by simple conversion\nnor by conversion per accidens. Both *modi* must be reduced by the\nmethod of indirect reduction or reduction ad impossibile.\n\nThe $\\bf Baroco$ syllogism has the form:\n\n>   ------ ----------------------------\n>   (S1)   All $X$ is $M$\n>          Some $Y$ is $\\neg M$\n>          Ergo Some $Y$ is $\\neg X$.\n>   ------ ----------------------------\n>\nTo carry out the reduction one takes as premiss the negation of the\nconclusion of S1:\n\nAll $Y$ is $X$\n\ntogether with the Major Premiss of S1:\n\nAll $X$ is $M$.\n\nOne gets then a First Figure ($\\bf Barbara$) syllogism:\n\n>   ------ ----------------------\n>   (S2)   All $X$ is $M$\n>          All $Y$ is $X$\n>          Ergo All $Y$ is $M$.\n>   ------ ----------------------\n>\nBut the conclusion of S2 is the negation of the Minor Premiss of S1.\nTherefore the hypothesis that the conclusion of S1 is false leads to a\ncontradiction and is considered to be established indirectly via the\nBarbara syllogism.\n\nThis is a new meaning of the concept of reduction and it is in this new\nmeaning that one says that Baroco syllogism can be reduced to Barbara.\nThe same argument applies to the Bocardo type of syllogism.\n\nA very common form of the use of the *Reductio ad Absurdum* consists in\na proof of $X$ assuming as Reductio Hypothesis $\\neg X$. When the\ncontradiction is reached one is then entitled to reject the Reductio\nHypothesis thus obtaining $\\neg \\neg X$.\n\nIn classical logic this Double Negation implies $X$ and we have reached\nour goal. In Heyting\u2019s system this form of Double Negation is not\naccepted and therefore the *Reductio ad Absurdum* or \u201cIndirect Method of\nProof\u201d is not allowed in intuitionistic mathematics.\n\nIt is instructive to consider a misformed proof by *Reductio ad\nAbsurdum*, such as John Kelley\u2019 proof that in 2-space two lines that do\nnot intersect are parallel, on pg. 295 of his *Algebra a Modern\nIntroduction*. Due to a recurring misprint the negation signs have not\nbeen inserted and the proof seems to use as hypothesis the very\nassertion that he wants to prove.\n\n[70]{} Aristotle, *Prior and Posterior Analytics*, ed. by W.D.
