  "definition": "[*Non-standard analysis*]{} is a branch of mathematics that formulates\nanalysis using a rigorous notion of infinitesimal, where an element of\nan ordered field $F$ is infinitesimal if and only if its absolute value\nis smaller than any element of $F$ of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$, for $n$ a\nnatural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also\ncalled non-Archimedean. More generally, non-standard analysis is any\nform of mathematics that relies on non-standard models and the transfer\nprinciple. A field which satisfies the transfer principle for real\nnumbers is a hyperreal field, and non-standard real analysis uses these\nfields as non-standard models of the real numbers.\n\nNon-standard analysis was introduced in the early 1960s by the\nmathematician Abraham Robinson. Robinson\u2019s original approach was based\non these non-standard models of the field of real numbers. His classic\nfoundational book on the subject [*Non-standard Analysis*]{} was\npublished in 1966 and is still in print.\n\nSeveral technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of\ninfinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered\nfield with infinitesimals. See the article on hyperreal numbers for a\ndiscussion of some of the relevant ideas.\n\nGiven any set $S$, the superstructure over a set $S$ is the set $V(S)$\ndefined by the conditions\n\n$$V_0(\\mathbf{S}) = \\mathbf{S}$$\n\n$$V_{n+1}(\\mathbf{S}) =V_{n}(\\mathbf{S}) \\cup 2^{V_{n}(\\mathbf{S})}$$\n\n$$V(\\mathbf{S}) = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} V_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$$\n\nThus the superstructure over $S$ is obtained by starting from $S$ and\niterating the operation of adjoining the power set of $S$ and taking the\nunion of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real\nnumbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it\ncontains isomorphic copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable\ntopological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests\nan analyst goes on within $V(R)$.\n\nThe working view of nonstandard analysis is a set $*R$ and a mapping\n$$*: V(\\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow V(*\\mathbb{R})$$ which satisfies some\nadditional properties. $*\\mathbb{R}$ is of course embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo formulate these principles we state first some definitions: A formula\nhas bounded quantification if and only if the only quantifiers which\noccur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of\nthe form:\n\n$$\\forall x \\in A, \\Phi(x, \\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$$\n$$\\exists x \\in A, \\Phi(x, \\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$$\n\nFor example, the formula\n\n$$\\forall x \\in A, \\ \\exists y \\in 2^B, \\ x \\in y$$ has bounded\nquantification, the universally quantified variable $x$ ranges over $A$,\nthe existentially quantified variable $y$ ranges over the powerset of\n$B$. On the other hand, $$\\forall x \\in A, \\ \\exists y, \\ x \\in y$$ does\nnot have bounded quantification because the quantification of $y$ is\nunrestricted.\n\nA set $x$ is internal if and only if x is an element of $*A$ for some\nelement $A$ of $V(R)$. $*A$ itself is internal if $A$ belongs to $V(R)$.\n\nWe now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:\nExtension principle: The mapping $*$ is the identity on $R$.\n\nTransfer principle: For any formula $P(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ with bounded\nquantification and with free variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, and for any\nelements $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ of $V(R)$, the following equivalence holds:\n:$$P(A_1, \\ldots, A_n) \\iff P(*A_1, \\ldots, *A_n)$$\n\nCountable saturation: If ${A_k}_k$ is a decreasing sequence of nonempty\ninternal sets, with $k$ ranging over the natural numbers, then\n:$$\\bigcap_k A_k \\neq \\emptyset$$\n\nOne can show using ultraproducts that such a map \\* exists. Elements of\n$V(R)$ are called standard. Elements of $*R$ are called hyperreal\nnumbers.\n\nThe symbol $*N$ denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the\nextension principle, this is a superset of $N$. The set $*N - N$ is not\nempty. To see this, apply countable saturation to the sequence of\ninternal sets\n\n$$A_k = \\{k \\in *\\mathbb{N}: k \\geq n\\}$$\n\nThe sequence ${A_k}_k$ is in $N$ has a non-empty intersection, proving\nthe result.\n\nWe begin with some definitions: Hyperreals $r$, $s$ are infinitely close\nif and only if\n\n$$r \\cong s \\iff \\forall \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^+, \\ |r - s| \\leq \\theta$$\n\nA hyperreal $r$ is infinitesimal if and only if it is infinitely close\nto 0. $r$ is limited or bounded if and only if its absolute value is\ndominated by a standard integer. The bounded hyperreals form a subring\nof $*R$ containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals\nare an ideal. For example, if $n$ is an element of $*N - N$, then\n${1 \\over n}$ is an infinitesimal.\n\nThe set of bounded hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are\nexternal subsets of $V(*R)$; what this means in practice is that bounded\nquantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over\nthese sets.\n\n[*This entry was adapted from the Wikipedia article as of December 19,\n2006.*]{}",
