If there are injections $S \\to T$ and\n$T \\to S$, then there is a bijection $S\\to T$.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem is useful for proving many results about\ncardinality, since it replaces one hard problem (finding a bijection\nbetween $S$ and $T$) with two generally easier problems (finding two\ninjections).",
