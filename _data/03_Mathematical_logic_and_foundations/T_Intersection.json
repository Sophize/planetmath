  "definition": "The *intersection* of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set that contains all\nthe elements $x$ such that $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$. The intersection of\n$A$ and $B$ is written as $A \\cap B$. The following Venn diagram\nillustrates the intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$:\n\n(0,0)(6,4) (2,2)[2]{} (4,2)[2]{} (1,2)[$A$]{} (3,2)[$A\\cap B$]{}\n(5,2)[$B$]{} (0,0)[$.$]{} (6,4)[$.$]{}\n\n**Example**. If $A=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $B=\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ then\n$A\\cap B=\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n\nWe can also define the intersection of an arbitrary number of sets. If\n$\\{A_j\\}_{j\\in J}$ is a family of sets, we define the intersection of\nall them, denoted $\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_j$, as the set consisting of those\nelements belonging to every set $A_j$:\n$$\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_ j = \\{x: x\\in A_j  \\mbox{ for all } j\\in J \\}.$$\n\nA set $U$ *intersects*, or *meets*, a set $V$ if $U\\cap V$ is non-empty.\n\nSome elementary properties of $\\cap$ are\n\n-   (idempotency) $A\\cap A = A$,\n\n-   (commutativity) $A\\cap B=B\\cap A$,\n\n-   (associativity) $A\\cap (B\\cap C) = (A\\cap B)\\cap C$,\n\n-   $A\\cap A^\\complement = \\varnothing$, where $A^\\complement$ is the\n    complement of $A$ in some fixed universe $U$.\n\n**Remark**. What is $\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_j$ when $J=\\varnothing$? In\nother words, what is the intersection of an empty family of sets? First\nnote that if $I\\subseteq J$, then\n$$\\bigcap_{j\\in J} A_j \\subseteq \\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i.$$ This leads the\nconclusion that the intersection of an empty family of sets should be as\nlarge as possible. How large should it be? In addition, is this\nintersection a set? The answer depends on what versions of set theory we\nare working in. Some theories (for example, von Neumann-G\u00f6del-Bernays)\nsay this is the class $V$ of all sets, while others do not define this\nnotion at all. However, if there is a fixed set $U$ in advance such that\neach $A_j\\subseteq U$, then it is sometimes a matter of convenience to\n*define* the intersection of an empty family of $A_j$ to be $U$.",
