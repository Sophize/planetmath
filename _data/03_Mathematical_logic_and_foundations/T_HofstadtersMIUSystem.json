  "definition": "The alphabet of the system contains three symbols $M, I, U$. The set of\ntheorem is the set of string constructed by the rules and the axiom, is\ndenoted by $\\mathcal{T}$ and can be built as follows:\n\n1.  $MI\\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\n2.  If $xI\\in \\mathcal{T}$ then $xIU\\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\n3.  If $Mx \\in \\mathcal{T}$ then $Mxx\\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\n4.  In any theorem, $III$ can be replaced by $U$.\n\n5.  In any theorem, $UU$ can be omitted.\n\n**example:**\\\n\n-   Show that $MUII \\in \\mathcal{T}$\\\n\n      -------------------------------------- --------------------------------\n      $MI\\in \\mathcal{T}$                    by axiom\n      $\\implies MII\\in \\mathcal{T}$          by rule (ii) where $x=I$\n      $\\implies MIIII\\in \\mathcal{T}$        by rule (ii) where $x=II$\n      $\\implies MIIIIIIII\\in \\mathcal{T}$    by rule (ii) where $x=IIII$\n      $\\implies MIIIIIIIIU\\in \\mathcal{T}$   by rule (i) where $x=MIIIIIII$\n      $\\implies MIIIIIUU\\in \\mathcal{T}$     by rule (iii)\n      $\\implies MIIIII\\in \\mathcal{T}$       by rule (iv)\n      $\\implies MUII\\in \\mathcal{T}$         by rule (iii)\n      -------------------------------------- --------------------------------\n\n-   Is $MU$ a theorem?\\\n    No. Why? Because the number of $I$\u2019s of a theorem is never a\n    multiple of 3. We will show this by structural induction.\\\n    \\\n    *base case:* The statement is true for the base case. Since the\n    axiom has one $I$ . Therefore not a multiple of 3.\\\n    *induction hypothesis:* Suppose true for premise of all rule.\\\n    *induction step:* By induction hypothesis we assume the premise of\n    each rule to be true and show that the application of the rule keeps\n    the staement true.\\\n    *Rule 1:* Applying rule 1 does not add any $I$\u2019s to the formula.\n    Therefore the statement is true for rule 1 by induction hypothesis.\\\n    *Rule 2:* Applying rule 2 doubles the amount of $I$\u2019s of the formula\n    but since the initial amount of $I$\u2019s was not a multiple of 3 by\n    induction hypothesis. Doubling that amount does not make it a\n    multiple of 3 *(i.e. if $n \\not\\equiv 0 \\operatorname{mod} 3$ then\n    $2n \\not\\equiv 0 \\operatorname{mod} 3$)*. Therefore the statement is\n    true for rule 2.\\\n    *Rule 3:* Applying rule 3 replaces $III$ by $U$. Since the initial\n    amount of $I$\u2019s was not a multiple of 3 by induction hypothesis.\n    Removing $III$ will not make the number of $I$\u2019s in the formula be a\n    multiple of 3. Therefore the statement is true for rule 3.\\\n    *Rule 4:* Applying rule 4 removes $UU$ and does not change the\n    amount of $I$\u2019s. Since the initial amount of $I$\u2019s was not a\n    multiple of 3 by induction hypothesis. Therefore the statement is\n    true for rule 4.\\\n    \\\n    Therefore all theorems do not have a multiple of 3 $I$\u2019s.\n\n[@1]\n\n[1]{} Hofstader, R.
