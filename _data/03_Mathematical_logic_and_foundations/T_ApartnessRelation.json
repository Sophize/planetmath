  "definition": "Given two arbitrary real numbers $r,s$, how does one (better yet, a\ncomputer) prove $r=s$? Given decimal representations of $r$ and $s$:\n$$r=r_0.r_1 r_2 r_3 \\ldots\\qquad s=s_0.s_1 s_2 s_3 \\ldots$$ one needs to\nshow that $r_0 =s_0$, $r_1=s_1$, $r_2=s_2$, etc... which involves\ndemonstrating an infinite number of equalities. On the other hand,\nshowing that $r\\ne s$ is a finitary process, in that one proceeds as\nabove, and then stops when he/she finds a decimal place $n$ where the\ntwo corresponding digits differ: $r_n \\ne s_n$. Therefore, in\nconstructive mathematics, inequality is a more appropriate choice of\nstudy than equality. The formal notion of inequality in constructive\nmathematics is that of an apartness relation.\n\nAn *apartness relation* on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\\#$ on $X$\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n\n1.  $\\forall x (\\neg x \\#x) $,\n\n2.  $\\forall x \\forall y (x \\#y  \\to y \\#x )$, and\n\n3.  $\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z (x \\# y \\to (x \\# z \\lor y \\#z))$.\n\nAnd if in addition, we have the following\n\n4.  $\\forall x \\forall y(\\neg x \\# y \\leftrightarrow x=y) $\n\nThen $\\#$ is said to be *tight*.\n\nIn classical mathematics where the law of the excluded middle is\naccepted, the following are true:\n\n1.  the first condition is redundant if $\\#$ is assumed to be tight.\n\n2.  the second condition above is redundant, for if $x\\# y$, then\n    $x\\# x$ or $y\\# x$ by condition 3, but then by condition 1, $x \\# x$\n    is false, therefore $y\\# x$.\n\n3.  the converse of an apartness relation is an equivalence relation:\n    define $x R y$ iff not $x \\# y$. Since $x \\# x$ is false for all\n    $x \\in X$, $x R x$ for all $x\\in X$. Also, the contrapositive of the\n    second condition above shows that $R$ is symmetric. Now, suppose\n    $x R y$ and $y R z$. Then not $x \\# y$ and not $y \\# z$, or not\n    $(x \\# y \\lor z \\# y)$. Applying the contrapositive of the third\n    condition, we have not $x \\# z$, or $x R z$. So $R$ is transitive.\n\n4.  Conversely, the converse of an equivalence relation is an apartness\n    relation: suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation, and define\n    $x \\# y$ iff not $x R y$. Then irreflexivity and symmetry of $\\#$\n    are clear from the reflexivity and symmetry of $R$. Now, suppose\n    $x \\# y$. Pick any $z\\in X$. If not $x \\# z$ and not $y \\# z$, then\n    $x R z$ and $y R z$, or $z R y$, which means $x R y$ since $R$ is\n    transitive. But this contradicts the assumption $x \\# y$, or not\n    $x R y$.\n\nBased on the last two observations, we see that the notion of apartness\nis not a very useful in mathematics based on classical logic, as the\nstudy of equivalence relation suffices.\n\nOn the other hand, arguing constructively, the second and the last\nstatements above no longer hold, because the law of the excluded middle\n(and proof by contradiction) is used to derive both results. In other\nwords, the apartness relation is a distinct concept in constructive\nmathematics. Below are some examples (and non-examples) of tight\napartness relations:\n\n-   $\\ne$ is a tight apartness relation on the set of rationals\n    $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n-   more generally, $\\ne$ is a tight apartness relation on a set $X$ if\n    \u201c$=$\u201d on $X$ is a deciable predicate, that is, for any pair\n    $x,y \\in X$, either $x=y$ or $x\\ne y$.\n\n-   However, $\\ne$ is not a tight apartness relation on the set of reals\n    $\\mathbb{R}$, since if $x\\ne y$, it may not be possible to prove\n    constructively that, for any given real number $z$, $x\\ne z$ or\n    $y\\ne z$ (because such a proof may be infinite in length).\n\n-   However, if we define $x\\# y$ iff there is a rational number $r$\n    such that $$(x<r<y)\\lor (y<r<x),$$ then $\\#$ is a tight apartness\n    relation. To see this, first note that $\\#$ is irreflexive and\n    symmetric. Also, it is not hard to see that the converse of $\\#$ is\n    $=$. Now, suppose $x\\#y$. Pick any real number $z$. If not $x\\#z$,\n    then $x=z$, which means $y\\#z$. Similarly, if not $y\\#z$, then\n    $x\\#z$.",
