  "definition": "The modal logic **D** (for deontic) is the smallest normal modal logic\ncontaining the schema D: $$\\square A \\to \\diamond A$$ A binary relation\n$R$ on $W$ is *serial* if for any $w\\in W$, there is a $u\\in W$ such\nthat $w R u$. In other words, $R$ is first order definable:\n$$\\forall w \\exists u (w R u).$$ The Kripke frames corresponding to\n**D** are serial, in the following sense:\n\nD is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$ iff $\\mathcal{F}$ is serial.\n\nFirst, assume $D$ valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}:=(W,R)$, and $w\\in W$.\nLet $M$ be a model based on $\\mathcal{F}$, with\n$V(p)=\\lbrace u\\mid w R u\\rbrace$. Then $\\models_w \\square p$, so that\n$\\models_w \\diamond p$. This means there is a $v$ such that $w R v$, and\nhence $R$ is serial.\n\nConversely, let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a serial frame, $M$ a model based on\n$\\mathcal{F}$, and $w$ a world in $M$. Then there is a $u$ such that\n$w R u$. Suppose $\\models_w \\square A$. Then for all $v$ such that\n$w R v$, we have $\\models_v A$. In particular, $\\models_u A$. Therefore,\n$\\models_w \\diamond A$, whence $\\models_w \\square A \\to \\diamond A$.\n\nAs a result,\n\n**D** is sound in the class of serial frames.\n\nSince any theorem in **D** is deducible from a finite sequence\nconsisting of tautologies, which are valid in any frame, instances of D,\nwhich are valid in serial frames by the proposition above, and\napplications of modus ponens and necessitation, both of which preserve\nvalidity in any frame, whence the result.\n\nIn addition, using the canonical model of **D**, we have\n\n**D** is complete in the class of serial frames.\n\nWe show that the canonical frame $\\mathcal{F}_{\\textbf{D}}$ is serial.\nLet $w$ be any maximally consistent set containing **D**. For any\n$A \\in \\Delta_w:=\\lbrace B \\mid \\square B \\in w \\rbrace$, we have\n$\\square A \\in w$, so that $\\diamond A\\in w$ by modus ponens on D. This\nmeans that $\\square \\neg A \\notin w$ since $w$ is maximal. As a result,\n$\\neg A \\notin \\Delta_w$, showing that $\\Delta_w$ is consistent, and\nhence can be enlarged to a maximally consistent set $u$. As a result,\n$A \\in u$, whence $w R_{\\textbf{D}} u$.\n\n**D** is a subsystem of **T**, for any reflexive relation is serial. As\na result, any theorem of **D** is valid in any serial frame, and\ntherefore in any reflexive frame in particular, and as a result a\ntheorem of **T** by the completeness of **T** in reflexive frames.",
