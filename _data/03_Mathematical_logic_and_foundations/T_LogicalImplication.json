  "definition": "Short version\n=============\n\n**Logical implication** is an operation on two logical values, typically\nthe values of two , that produces a value of false just in case the\nfirst operand is true and the second operand is false.\n\nThe truth table for the logical implication operation that is written as\n$p \\Rightarrow q$ and read as $``p\\ \\operatorname{implies}\\ q\",$ also\nwritten as $p \\rightarrow q$ and read as\n$``\\operatorname{if}\\ p\\ \\operatorname{then}\\ q\",$ is as follows:\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> $p$ & $q$ & $p \\Rightarrow q$\\\n> F & F & T\\\n> F & T & T\\\n> T & F & F\\\n> T & T & T\\\n\nLong version\n============\n\nThe mathematical objects that inform our capacity for logical reasoning\nare easier to describe in a straightforward way than it is to reconcile\ntheir traditional accounts. Still, some discussion of the language that\noccurs in the literature cannot be avoided.\n\nThe concept of **logical implication** encompasses a specific logical\nfunction, a specific logical relation, and the various symbols that are\nused to denote this function and this relation. In order to define the\nspecific function, relation, and symbols in question it is first\nnecessary to establish a few ideas about the connections among them.\n\nClose approximations to the concept of logical implication are expressed\nin ordinary language by means of linguistic forms like the following:\n\n-   $p$ implies $q$.\n\n-   If $p$ then $q$.\n\nHere $p$ and $q$ are propositional variables that stand for any\npropositions in a given language. In a statement of the form \u201cif $p$\nthen $q$\", the first term, $p$, is called the *antecedent* and the\nsecond term, $q$, is called the *consequent*, while the statement as a\nwhole is called either the *conditional* or the *consequence*. Assuming\nthat the conditional statement is true, then the truth of the antecedent\nis a *sufficient condition* for the truth of the consequent, while the\ntruth of the consequent is a *necessary condition* for the truth of the\nantecedent.\n\nMany writers draw a technical distinction between the form \u201c$p$ implies\n$q$\" and the form \u201cif $p$ then $q$\". In this view, writing \u201c$p$ implies\n$q$\" asserts the existence of a certain relation between the logical\nvalue of $p$ and the logical value of $q$ while writing \u201cif $p$ then\n$q$\" simply forms a compound sentence whose logical value is a function\nof the logical values of $p$ and $q$. Notice that a relation is a\nmathematical object while a sentence, whether open or closed, is a\nsyntactic form that exists in the domain of .\n\nTwo factors enter at cross-purposes to our understanding at this point,\nand they have historically been the source of many divergent thinkers\ntalking skew to each other on this score.\n\n-   There is the contrast between \u201cobject\" and \u201csign\". Objects include\n    among their number abstract, formal, and mathematical objects. Signs\n    include the full variety of syntactic forms in general. For some\n    thinkers, objects are the primary concerns and language merely\n    accessory to them. For other thinkers, signs are the primary\n    business and objects always mediated by them, with formal objects\n    being perhaps the mere illusions that are produced in our minds by\n    forms of words.\n\n-   There is the contrast between the relational aspect and the\n    functional aspect of the mathematical objects in question. This\n    issue is less problematic within mathematics itself, it being\n    axiomatic that a binary operation is a ternary relation and because\n    there are standard ways of relating characteristic functions with\n    the sets and relations that are their fibers.\n\nDefinition\n----------\n\nThe concept of logical implication is associated with an operation on\ntwo logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that\nproduces a value of false just in case the first operand is true and the\nsecond operand is false.\n\nIn the interpretation where $0 = \\mathrm{false}$ and\n$1 = \\mathrm{true}$, the truth table associated with the statement \u201c$p$\nimplies $q$\", symbolized as $p \\Rightarrow q$, is as follows:\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> $p$ & $q$ & $p \\Rightarrow q$\\\n> 0 & 0 & 1\\\n> 0 & 1 & 1\\\n> 1 & 0 & 0\\\n> 1 & 1 & 1\\\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nThe usage of the terms *logical implication* and *material conditional*\nvaries from field to field and even across different contexts of\ndiscussion. One way to minimize the potential confusion is to begin with\na focus on the various types of formal objects that are being discussed,\nof which there are only a few, taking up the variations in language as a\nsecondary matter.\n\nThe main formal object under discussion is a logical operation on two\nlogical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces\na value of false just in case the first operand is true and the second\noperand is false. By way of a temporary name, the logical operation in\nquestion may be written as $\\operatorname{cond}(p, q)$, where $p$ and\n$q$ are logical values. The truth table associated with this operation\nis as follows:\n\n> [|c|c|c|]{}\\\n> $p$ & $q$ & $\\operatorname{cond}(p, q)$\\\n> 0 & 0 & 1\\\n> 0 & 1 & 1\\\n> 1 & 0 & 0\\\n> 1 & 1 & 1\\\n\nSome writers draw a firm distinction between the *conditional\nconnective* (the syntactic sign $``\\rightarrow\"$) and the implication\nrelation (the formal object denoted by the sign $``\\Rightarrow\"$). These\nwriters use the phrase \u201cif\u2013then\" for the conditional connective and the\nterm \u201cimplies\" for the implication relation. The difference is sometimes\nexplained by saying that the conditional is the \u201ccontemplated\" relation\nwhile the implication is the \u201casserted\" relation. In most areas of\nmathematics, the distinction is treated as a variation in the usage of\nthe single sign $``\\Rightarrow\"$, not requiring two separate signs. Not\nall of those who use the sign $``\\rightarrow\"$ for the conditional\nconnective regard it as a sign that denotes any kind of formal object,\nbut treat it as a so-called *syncategorematic sign*, that is, a sign\nwith a purely syntactic function. For the sake of clarity and simplicity\nin the present introduction, it is convenient to use the two-sign\nnotation, but allow the sign $``\\rightarrow\"$ to denote the boolean\nfunction that is associated with the truth table of the material\nconditional. These considerations result in the following scheme of\nnotation.\n\n> $\\begin{matrix}\n> p \\rightarrow q                  & \\quad & \\quad & p \\Rightarrow q        \\\\\n> \\mathrm{if}\\ p\\ \\mathrm{then}\\ q & \\quad & \\quad & p\\ \\mathrm{implies}\\ q \\\\\n> \\end{matrix}$\n\nLet $\\mathbb{B} = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$, where 0 is interpreted as the logical\nvalue $\\mathrm{false}$ and 1 is interpreted as the logical value\n$\\mathrm{true}$. The truth table shows the ordered triples of a triadic\nrelation $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B}$\nthat is defined as follows:\n\n> $L = \\{ (p, q, r) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} : \\operatorname{cond}(p, q) = r \\}$.\n\nRegarded as a set, this triadic relation is the same thing as the binary\noperation:\n\n> $\\operatorname{cond} : \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\to \\mathbb{B}$.\n\nThe relationship between $\\operatorname{cond}$ and $L$ exemplifies the\nstandard association that exists between any binary operation and its\ncorresponding triadic relation.\n\nThe conditional sign $``\\rightarrow\"$ denotes the same formal object as\nthe function name $\\operatorname{cond}$, the only difference being that\nthe first is written infix while the second is written prefix. Thus we\nhave the following equation:\n\n> $(p \\rightarrow q) = \\operatorname{cond}(p, q)$.\n\nConsider once again the triadic relation\n$L \\subseteq \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B}$ that is\ndefined in the following equivalent fashion:\n\n> $L = \\{ (p, q, \\operatorname{cond}(p, q)) : (p, q) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\}$.\n\nAssociated with the 3-adic relation $L$ is a 2-adic relation\n$L_{..1} \\subseteq \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B}$ that is called the\n*fiber* of $L$ with 1 in the third place. This object is defined as\nfollows:\n\n> $L_{..1} := \\{ (p, q) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} : (p, q, 1) \\in L \\}$.\n\nThe same object is achieved in the following way. Begin with the 2-adic\noperation:\n\n> $\\operatorname{cond} : \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} \\to \\mathbb{B}$.\n\nForm the 2-adic relation that is called the *fiber* of\n$\\operatorname{cond}$ at 1, notated as follows:\n\n> $\\operatorname{cond}^{-1}(1) \\subseteq \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B}$.\n\nThis object is defined as follows:\n\n> $\\operatorname{cond}^{-1}(1) = \\{ (p, q) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{B} : \\operatorname{cond}(p, q) = 1 \\}$.\n\nThe implication sign $``\\Rightarrow\"$ denotes the same formal object as\nthe relation names $``L_{..1}\"$ and $``\\operatorname{cond}^{-1}(1)\"$,\nthe only differences being purely syntactic. Thus we have the following\nlogical equivalence:\n\n> $(p \\Rightarrow q) \\iff (p, q) \\in L_{..1} \\iff (p, q) \\in \\operatorname{cond}^{-1}(1)$.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the mathematical objects that are\ndenoted by the signs $``\\rightarrow\"$ and $``\\Rightarrow\"$ in this\ndiscussion. It needs to be remembered, though, that not all writers\nobserve this distinction in every context. Especially in mathematics,\nwhere the sign $``\\rightarrow\"$ is reserved for function notation, it is\ncommon to see the sign $``\\Rightarrow\"$ being used for both concepts.\n\nBibliography\n============\n\n-   Brown, Frank Markham (2003), *Boolean Reasoning : The Logic of\n    Boolean Equations*, 1st edition, Kluwer Academic Publishers,\n    Norwell, MA, 1990. 2nd edition, Dover Publications, Mineola, NY.\n\n-   Church, Alonzo (1962), \u201cLogic, formal\", pp. 170\u2013181 in Runes (1962).\n\n-   Church, Alonzo (1996), *Introduction to Mathematical Logic*.\n    Originally published, Annals of Mathemtics Studies, 1944.
