  "definition": "Boole (1854) defines **universe of discourse** in the following manner:\n\n> In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own\n> thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there\n> is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its\n> operation are confined. $\\ldots$ Now, whatever may be the extent of\n> the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found,\n> that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. (Boole\n> 1854/1958, p. 42).\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n-   Boole, George (1854/1958), *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought\n    on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and\n    Probabilities*, Macmillan Publishers, 1854.
