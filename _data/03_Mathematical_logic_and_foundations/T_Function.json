  "definition": "A *function* is a triplet $(f,A,B)$ where:\n\n1.  $A$ is a set (called the *domain* of the function).\n\n2.  $B$ is a set (called the *codomain* of the function).\n\n3.  $f$ is a binary relation between $A$ and $B$.\n\n4.  For every $a \\in A$, there exists $b \\in B$ such that $(a,b) \\in f$.\n\n5.  If $a \\in A$, $b_1,b_2 \\in B$, and $(a,b_1) \\in f$ and\n    $(a,b_2) \\in f$, then $b_1 = b_2$.\n\nThe triplet $(f,A,B)$ is usually written with the specialized notation\n$f\\colon A \\to B$. This notation visually conveys the fact that $f$ maps\nelements of $A$ into elements of $B$.\n\nOther standard notations for functions are as follows:\n\n-   For $a \\in A$, one denotes by $f(a)$ the unique element $b \\in B$\n    such that $(a,b) \\in f$.\n\n-   The *image* of $(f,A,B)$, denoted $f(A)$, is the set\n    $$\\{b \\in B \\mid f(a) = b \\text{ for some } a \\in A\\}$$ consisting\n    of all elements of $B$ which equal $f(a)$ for some element\n    $a \\in A$. Note that, by abuse of notation, the set $f(A)$ is almost\n    always called the image of $f$, rather than the image of $(f,A,B)$.\n\n-   In cases where the function $f$ is clear from context, the notation\n    $a \\mapsto b$ is equivalent to the statement $f(a) = b$.\n\n-   Given two functions $f\\colon A \\to B$ and $g\\colon B \\to C$, there\n    exists a unique function $g \\circ f\\colon A \\to C$ satisfying the\n    equation $g \\circ f(a) = g(f(a))$. The function $g \\circ f$ is\n    called the *composition* of $f$ and $g$, and a function constructed\n    in this manner is called a *composite function*. Composition is\n    associative, meaning that\n    $h \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f$ provided that either\n    expression is defined.\n\n-   When a function $f\\colon A \\to A$ has its domain equal to its\n    codomain, one often writes $f^n$ for the $n$-fold composition\n    $$\\underbrace{f \\circ f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f}_{n\\text{ times}}$$\n    where $n$ is any natural number. Occasionally this can be confused\n    with ordinary exponentiation (for example the function\n    $x\\mapsto (\\sin x)(\\sin x)$ is conventionally written as $\\sin^2$);\n    in such cases one usually writes $f^{[n]}$ to denote the $n$-fold\n    composition.\n\nThere is no universal agreement as to the definition of the *range* of a\nfunction. Some authors define the range of a function to be equal to the\ncodomain, and others define the range of a function to be equal to the\nimage.\n\n**Remark**. In set theory, a function is defined as a relation $f$, such\nthat whenever $(a,b),(a,c)\\in f$, then $b=c$. Notice that the sets $A,B$\nare not specified in advance, unlike the defintion given in the\nbeginning of the article. The *domain* and *range* of the function $f$\nis the domain and range of $f$ as a relation. Using this definition of a\nfunction, we may recapture the defintion at the top of the entry by\nsaying that a function $f$ *maps from a set $A$ into a set $B$*, if the\ndomain of $f$ is $A$, and the range of $f$ is a subset of $B$.",
