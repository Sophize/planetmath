  "definition": "The intercession is an alternative measure for infinite sets of finite\nnumbers.\n\nDefinition: Two infinite sets, *A* and *B*, *intercede* (each other) if\nthey can be put in an *intercession*, i.e., if they can be ordered such\nthat *A* is dense in *B* and *B* is dense in *A*. In other words,\nbetween two elements of *A* there is at least one element of *B* and,\n*vice versa*, between two elements of *B* there is at least one element\nof *A*.\n\nThe intercession of sets with nonempty intersection, e.g., the\nintercession of a set with itself, requires distinction of identical\nelements. As an example an intercession of the set of positive integers\nand the set of even positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ... and 2\u2019, 4\u2019, 6\u2019, ...,\nis given by 1, 2\u2019, 2, 4\u2019, 3, 6\u2019, ....\n\nThe intercession includes Cantor\u2019s definition of equivalent (or\nequipotent) sets by one-to-one correspondence (or bijection): Two\nequivalent sets always intercede each other, i.e., they can always be\nput in an intercession. The intercession is an equivalence relation. All\ninfinite sets of finite numbers (like the integers, the rationals or the\nreals) belong, under this relation, to the same equivalence class.\n\n**Literature** W.
