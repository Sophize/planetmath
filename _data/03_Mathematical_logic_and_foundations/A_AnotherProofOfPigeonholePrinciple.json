Otherwise, $f[m] \\subseteq m$, so that\nby the induction hypothesis, $f[m] = m$. Then $f[n] =\nf[m]$, since $f[n] \\subseteq m$. Therefore, for some $k < m$,\n$f(k) = f(m)$.\n\nLet $g : f[n] \\to f[n]$ transpose $m$ and $f(m)$. Then $h \\vert_m\n: m \\to m$ is injective, where $h = g \\circ f$. By the induction\nhypothesis, $h \\vert_m[m] = m$. Therefore: $$\\begin{aligned}\nf[n] &= g \\circ h[n]\n\\\\\n&= h[n]\n\\\\\n&= m \\cup \\{m\\}\n\\\\\n&= m + 1\n\\\\\n&= n \\text{.}\\end{aligned}$$",
