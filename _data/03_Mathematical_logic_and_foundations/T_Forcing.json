  "definition": "Forcing is the method used by Paul Cohen to prove the independence of\nthe continuum hypothesis (CH). In fact, the method was used by Cohen to\nprove that CH could be violated.\n\nAdding a set to a model of set theory via forcing is similar to\nadjoining a new element to a field. Suppose we have a field $k$, and we\nwant to add to this field an element $\\alpha$ such $\\alpha^2=-1$. We see\nthat we cannot simply drop a new $\\alpha$ in $k$, since then we are not\nguaranteed that we still have a field. Neither can we simply assume that\n$k$ already has such an element. The standard way of doing this is to\nstart by adjoining a generic indeterminate $X$, and impose a constraint\non $X$, saying that $X^2+1=0$. What we do is take the quotient\n$k[X]/(X^2+1)$, and make a field out of it by taking the quotient field.\nWe then obtain $k(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the equivalence class of\n$X$ in the quotient. The general case of this is the theorem of algebra\nsaying that every polynomial $p$ over a field $k$ has a root in some\nextension field.\n\nWe can rephrase this and say that \u201cit is consistent with standard field\ntheory that $-1$ have a square root\u201d.\n\nWhen the theory we consider is ZFC, we run in exactly the same problem :\nwe can\u2019t just add a \u201cnew\u201d set and pretend it has the required\nproperties, because then we may violate something else, like foundation.\nLet ${\\mathfrak{M}}$ be a transitive model of set theory, which we call\nthe [**ground model**]{}. We want to \u201cadd a new set\u201d $S$ to\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$ in such a way that the extension ${\\mathfrak{M}}'$ has\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$ as a subclass, and the properties of ${\\mathfrak{M}}$\nare preserved, and $S\\in{\\mathfrak{M}}'$.\n\nThe first step is to \u201capproximate\u201d the new set using elements of\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$. This is the analogue of finding the irreducible\npolynomial in the algebraic example. The set $P$ of such\n\u201capproximations\u201d can be ordered by how much information the\napproximations give : let $p,q\\in\nP$, then $p\\leq q$ if and only if $p$ \u201cis stronger than\u201d $q$. We call\nthis set a set of [**forcing conditions**]{}. Furthermore, it is\nrequired that the set $P$ itself and the order relation be elements of\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$.\n\nSince $P$ is a partial order, some of its subsets have interesting\nproperties. Consider $P$ as a topological space with the order topology.\nA subset $D\\subseteq P$ is [**dense**]{} in $P$ if and only if for every\n$p\\in P$, there is $d\\in D$ such that $d\\leq p$. A filter in $P$ is said\nto be [**${\\mathfrak{M}}$-generic**]{} if and only if it intersects\nevery one of the dense subsets of $P$ which are in ${\\mathfrak{M}}$. An\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$-generic filter in $P$ is also referred to as a\n[**generic set of conditions**]{} in the literature. In general, even\nthough $P$ is a set in ${\\mathfrak{M}}$, generic filters are not\nelements of ${\\mathfrak{M}}$.\n\nIf $P$ is a set of forcing conditions, and $G$ is a generic set of\nconditions in $P$, all in the ground model ${\\mathfrak{M}}$, then we\ndefine ${\\mathfrak{M}}[G]$ to be the least model of ZFC that contains\n$G$. The big theorem is this :\n\n${\\mathfrak{M}}[G]$ is a model of ZFC, and has the same ordinals as\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$, and ${\\mathfrak{M}}\\subseteq {\\mathfrak{M}}[G]$.\n\nThe way to prove that we can violate CH using a generic extension is to\nadd many new \u201csubsets of $\\omega$\u201d in the following way : let\n${\\mathfrak{M}}$ be a transitive model of ZFC, and let $(P,\\leq)$ be the\nset (in ${\\mathfrak{M}}$) of all functions $f$ whose domain is a finite\nsubset of $\\aleph_2\\times\\aleph_0$, and whose range is the set\n$\\{0,1\\}$. The ordering here is $p\\leq q$ if and only if $p\\supset q$.\nLet $G$ be a generic set of conditions in $P$. Then $\\bigcup G$ is a\ntotal function whose domain is $\\aleph_2\\times\\aleph_0$, and range is\n$\\{0,1\\}$. We can see this $f$ as coding $\\aleph_2$ new functions\n$f_\\alpha:\\aleph_0\\to\\{0,1\\}$, $\\alpha<\\aleph_2$, which are subsets of\nomega. These functions are all distinct. $(P,\\leq)$ since it satisfies\nthe countable chain condition. Thus\n$\\aleph_2^{{\\mathfrak{M}}[G]} = \\aleph_2^{{\\mathfrak{M}}}$ and CH is\nfalse in ${\\mathfrak{M}}[G]$.\n\nAll this relies on a proper definition of the satisfaction relation in\n${\\mathfrak{M}}[G]$, and the forcing relation.
