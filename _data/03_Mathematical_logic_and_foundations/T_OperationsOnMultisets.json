  "definition": "In this entry, we view multisets as functions whose ranges are the class\n$K$ of cardinal numbers. We define operations on multisets that mirror\nthe operations on sets.\n\n**Definition**. Let $f:A\\to K$ and $g:B\\to K$ be multisets.\n\n-   The union of $f$ and $g$, denoted by $f\\cup g$, is the multiset\n    whose domain is $A\\cup B$, such that\n    $$(f\\cup g)(x):= \\max(f(x),g(x)),$$ keeping in mind that $f(x):=0$\n    if $x$ is not in the domain of $f$.\n\n-   The intersection of $f$ and $g$, denoted by $f\\cap g$, is the\n    multiset, whose domain is $A\\cap B$, such that\n    $$(f\\cap g)(x):= \\min(f(x),g(x)).$$\n\n-   The sum (or disjoint union) of $f$ and $g$, denoted by $f+g$, is the\n    multiset whose domain is $A\\cup B$ (not the disjoint union of $A$\n    and $B$), such that $$(f+g)(x):=f(x)+g(x),$$ again keeping in mind\n    that $f(x):=0$ if $x$ is not in the domain of $f$.\n\nClearly, all of the operations described so far are commutative.\nFurthermore, if $+$ is cancellable on both sides: $f+g=f+h$ implies\n$g=h$, and $g+f=h+f$ implies $g=h$.\n\nSubtraction on multisets can also be defined. Suppose $f:A\\to K$ and\n$g:B\\to K$ are multisets. Let $C$ be the set\n$\\lbrace x \\in A\\cap B \\mid f(x)>g(x)\\rbrace$. Then\n\n-   the complement of $g$ in $f$, denoted by $f-g$, is the multiset\n    whose domain is $D:=(A-B)\\cup C$, such that $$(f-g)(x):=f(x)-g(x)$$\n    for all $x\\in D$.\n\nFor example, writing finite multisets (those with finite domains and\nfinite multiplicities for all elements) in their usual notations, if\n$f=\\lbrace a,a, b,b,b, c,d,d\\rbrace$ and\n$g=\\lbrace b,b, c,c,c, d,d,e\\rbrace$, then\n\n-   $f\\cup g=\\lbrace a,a, b,b,b, c,c,c,d,d,e\\rbrace$\n\n-   $f\\cap g=\\lbrace b,b,c,d,d\\rbrace$\n\n-   $f+g=\\lbrace a,a,b,b,b,b,b,c,c,c,c,d,d,d,d,e\\rbrace$\n\n-   $f-g=\\lbrace a,a,b\\rbrace$\n\nWe may characterize the union and intersection operations in terms of\nmultisubsets.\n\n**Definition**. A multiset $f:A\\to K$ is a *multisubset* of a multiset\n$g:B\\to K$ if\n\n1.  $A$ is a subset of $B$, and\n\n2.  $f(a)\\le g(a)$ for all $a\\in A$.\n\nWe write $f\\subseteq g$ to mean that $f$ is a multisubset of $g$.\n\nGiven multisets $f$ and $g$.\n\n-   $f\\cup g$ is the smallest multiset such that $f$ and $g$ are\n    multisubsets of it. In other words, if $f\\subseteq h$ and\n    $g\\subseteq h$, then $f\\cup g \\subseteq h$.\n\n-   $f\\cap g$ is the largest multiset that is a multisubset of $f$ and\n    $g$. In other words, if $h\\subseteq f$ and $h\\subseteq g$, then\n    $h\\subseteq f\\cap g$.\n\n**Remark**. One may also define the powerset of a multiset $f$: the\nmultiset such that each of its elements is a multisubset of $f$.\nHowever, the resulting multiset is just a set (the multiplicity of each\nelement is $1$).",
