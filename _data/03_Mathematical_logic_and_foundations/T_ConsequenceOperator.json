A *consequence operator* on $L$ is a mapping[^1]\n$C \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$ which satisfies the\nfollowing three properties:\n\n1.  For all $X \\subseteq L$, it happens that $X \\subseteq C(X)$.\n\n2.  $C \\circ C = C$\n\n3.  For all $X, Y \\subseteq L$, if $X \\subseteq Y$, then\n    $C(X) \\subseteq C(Y)$\n\nIf, in addition, the following condition is satisfied, then a\nconsequence operator $C$ is known as *finitary* . (Synonyms are \u201cfinite\nconsequence operator\u201d and \u201calgebraic consequence operator\u201d.)\n\n-   For all $X \\in L$, it happens that\n    $C(X) = \\bigcup\\limits_{Y \\in \\mathcal{F} (X)} C(Y)$.\n\nIt is worth noting that, if the above condition is satisfied, then the\nthird condition of last paragraph becomes superfluous \u2014 as shown in , it\nautomatically follows from conitions 1 and 2 of last paragraph and the\ncondition stated above.\n\nA consequence operator $C$ such that $C(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$ is\ncalled *axiomless*. A consequence operator $C$ such that\n$C(\\emptyset) \\not= \\emptyset$ is called *axiomatic*.\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\nAlfred Tarksi introduced consequence operators as a way of discussing\nthe notion of conclusions following from premises in a general fashion.\nSuppose that the set $L$ consists of statements in some language. Then,\ngiven a set of statements $X$, let $C(X)$ be the set of all statements\nwhich can be inferred form statements of $X$.\n\nThe defining properties of \u201cconsequence operator\u201d given above then\nexpress some fundamental facts about the process of inferring\nconclusions from premises: Any statement can be concluded from itself.\nIf a statement $s$ follows from a set of premises $X$ and $Y$ is a\nsuperset of $X$, then $s$ also follows from $Y$. If one augments a set\nof premises by conclusions derived from those premises, then one can\nonly draw conclusions from the larger set which could have been drawn\nfrom the original set of premises. Note that these conditions hold for a\nlarge class of logics, not just classical logic of Aristotle, Boole, and\nFrege. However, they do not hold for all logics \u2014 in particular, there\nare the so-called nonmonotonic logics in which it is not always the case\nthat, if $X \\subset Y$, then $C(X) \\subseteq C(Y)$.\n\nIn terms of this usage in logic, it is easy to understand the origin of\nthe terms \u201caxiomatic\u201d and \u201caxiomless\u201d. An axiom in a logical theory is a\nstatement which is assumed true without having to prove it from any\nother statement. Hence, an axiom is a consequence of the empty set, so\nwe call consequence operators which allow one to deduce conclusions from\nan empty set of premises axiomatic.\n\nThe distinction of finitary consequence operators has to do with whether\none is permitted to draw a conclusion from an infinite set of premises\nwhich could not be drawn from any finite subset thereof. As for why one\nmight want to do this, consider the following example. Suppose $X$\nconsists of the following statements:\n\n-   $1 = 1^2$\n\n-   $2 = 1^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $3 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $4 = 2^2$\n\n-   $5 = 2^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $6 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $7 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $8 = 2^2 + 2^2$\n\n-   $9 = 3^2$\n\n-   $10 = 3^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $11 = 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $12 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2$\n\n-   $13 = 3^2 + 2^2$\n\n-   $14 = 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2$\n\n-   $\\cdots$\n\nFrom $X$ one would like to be able to draw the conclusion \u201cAny positive\ninteger can be expressed as the sum of at most four squares.\u201d. This\nconclusion, however, cannot be inferred from any proper subset of $X$,\nin particular, from any finite subset of $X$. To make this conclusion\nwould require a consequence operator which is not finitary.\n\nExamples\n========\n\n1.  To begin, there are two trivial consequence operators defined on any\n    set. One is the identity operator\n    $I \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$ defined as $I(X) = X$.\n    The other is the constant operator\n    $U \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$ defined as $U(X) = L$.\n    It is perfectly straightforward to check that these two operators\n    satisfy the defining properties of consequence operator and,\n    furthermore, that they are both finitary consequence operators and\n    that $I$ is axiomless whilst $U$ is axiomatic. Trivial though they\n    may be, these operators play an important role as exrtremal elements\n    in the lattice of all consequence operators over a given set.\n\n2.  Next, we consider some less trivial consequence operators which can\n    be defined over an arbitrary set. Let $X$ and $Y$ be any two subsets\n    of $L$. Then we may define operators\n    $C_\\cap (X,Y) \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$ and\n    $C_\\cup (X,Y) \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$ as follows:\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n     C_\\cap (X,Y)(Z) &=& \\begin{cases} X \\cup Z & Y \\cap Z \n    \\not= \\emptyset \\\\ Z & Y \\cap Z = \\emptyset \\end{cases} \\\\\n    C_\\cup (X,Y)(Z) &=& \\begin{cases} X \\cup Z & Y \\cup Z = Z \\\\ Z & Y \\cup Z \n    \\not= Z \\end{cases} \\end{aligned}$$ It is shown that these are\n    indeed consequence operators in an attachment to this entry.\n\n3.  A much larger class of consequence operators may be defined as\n    follows. Let $K$ be a subset of $\\mathcal{P}(L)$ which includes $L$.\n    Then, as shown in an , the map\n    $C \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$, defined as\n    $$C(X) = \\cap \\{ Y \\in K \\mid X \\subseteq Y \\},$$ is a consequence\n    operator. As we shall see, all consequence operators can be obtained\n    by this construction. In particular, the examples discussed above\n    can be obtained as follows: To obtain $I$, set $K = \\mathbf{P}(L)$;\n    to obtain $U$, set $K = \\{ L \\}$; to obtain $C_\\cap (X,Y)$, set\n    $$K = \\{ Z \\subseteq L \\mid Y \\cap Z = \\emptyset \\} \\cup\n    \\{ X \\cup Z \\mid Z \\subseteq L \\,\\land\\, Y \\cap Z \\not= \\emptyset \\};$$\n    to obtain $C_\\cup (X,Y)$, set\n    $$K = \\{ Z \\subseteq L \\mid Y \\cup Z \\not= \\emptyset \\} \\cup\n    \\{ X \\cup Z \\mid Z \\subseteq L \\,\\land\\, Y \\cup Z = \\emptyset \\}.$$\n\n4.  Turning to more specific examples, we have the example which\n    inspired the definintion in the first place. Let $L$ be a set of\n    logical expressions constructed from some set of sentence letters\n    and predicate letters and the usual connectives and quantifiers.\n    Given a subset $X \\subseteq L$, let $C(X)$ be the set of all\n    expressions $\\psi$ for which there exists a finite set of\n    expressions $\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_n$ such that\n    $\\ulcorner \\phi_1 \\land \\cdots \\land \\phi_n \\Rightarrow \\psi \\urcorner$\n    is a tautology. Note that this is a finitary consequence operator \u2014\n    it does not enable one to make the sort of deductions from infinite\n    sets of premises described above.\n\n5.  This notion of consequence operator also applies to areas of\n    mathematics other than logic. For instance, suppose that $L$ is a\n    vector space. Then the operator which assigns to a subset of $L$ the\n    vector subspace which it spans is a consequence operator. This\n    particular consequence operator is finitary because if a vector $v$\n    belongs to the span of a set $X$, then $v$ can be expressed as a\n    linear combination of a finite number of elements of $X$.\n\n6.  The closure operator in topology is a consequence operator. It is\n    worth pointing out that not every consequence operator can be\n    expressed as the closure operator for some topology because the\n    closure operator satisfies some extra conditions beyond those which\n    define consequence operators. Typically, the closure operator is not\n    finitary because infinite subsets of topological spaces may have\n    limit points.\n\nAlternative Definition and Generalization\n=========================================\n\nA consequence operator can be characterized by its fixed points. Given a\nconsequence operator $C \\colon \\mathcal{P}(L) \\to \\mathcal{P}(L)$, set\n$K = \\{ X \\subseteq L \\mid C(X) = X\\}$. By the second defining property\nof consequence operator, we have $K = \\{ C(X) \\mid X \\in L\\}$. One can\nshow that $$C(X) = \\cap \\{ Y \\in K \\mid X \\subseteq Y \\}.$$\n\nConversely, suppose that $K$ is a subset of $L$ with the following\nminimum property:\n\n-   For every $X \\in L$, there exists a $Y \\in K$ such that\n    $X \\subseteq Y$ and if, for any $Z \\in K$, if $X \\subseteq Z$, then\n    $Y \\subseteq Z$.\n\nThen the operator $C$ defined as\n$$C(X) = \\cap \\{ Y \\in K \\mid X \\subseteq Y \\}$$ is a consequence\noperator with $K$ as its set of fixed points.\n\nOne may also define consequence operators in the more general context of\na partially ordered set which may not be the power set of any set.\nSuppose that $\\langle S, \\le \\rangle$ is a partially ordered set. Then\nwe may define a consequence operator on this ordered set to be a map\n$C \\colon S \\to S$ which satisfies the following three properties:\n\n1.  For all $X \\in S$, it happens that $X \\le C(X)$.\n\n2.  $C \\circ C = C$\n\n3.  For all $X, Y \\in S$, if $X \\le Y$, then $C(X) \\le C(Y)$\n\nSuch more general consequence operators arise frequently when we\nrestrict attention to distinguished subsets of a set. As an example, we\nmay consider the following situation. Let $S$ be the set of linear\nsubspaces of a Banach space, ordered by inclusion. Then the operator\n$C \\colon S \\to S$ which assigns to each subspace its Cauchy completion\nis a consequence operator.\n\nAs an example which does not arise this way, let $S = \\mathbb{R}$ with\nthe usual order. Then the ceiling function $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil \\colon\n\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a consequence operator.\n\nFor another example, let $S$ be the set of all fields with a countable\nnumber of elements. This set may be ordered as follows: $E \\le F$ if and\nonly if there exists a non-trivial morphism of $E$ into $F$. Then the\noperator which sends each field to its algebraic closure is a\nconsequence operator.\n\n[^1]: Here, \u201c$\\mathcal{P}$\u201d denotes the power set and $\\mathcal{F}$\n    denotes the finite power set.",
