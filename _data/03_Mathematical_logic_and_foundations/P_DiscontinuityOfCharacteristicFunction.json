Then any of\n$a$ contains the points $b$ and $c$ such that $\\chi_A(b) = 1$ and\n$\\chi_A(c) = 0$. Thus $b \\in A$ and $c \\notin A$, whence $a$ is a\nboundary point of $A$.\n\nIf, on the contrary, $a$ is a boundary point of $A$ and $U(a)$ an\narbitrary neighborhood of $a$, it follows that $U(a)$ contains both\npoints belonging to $A$ and points not belonging to $A$. So we have in\n$U(a)$ the points $b$ and $c$ such that $\\chi_A(b) = 1$ and\n$\\chi_A(c) = 0$. This means that $\\chi_A$ cannot be continuous at the\npoint $a$ (N.B. that one does not need to know the value $\\chi_A(a)$).",
