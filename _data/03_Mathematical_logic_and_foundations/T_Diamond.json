  "definition": "Let $S\\subseteq\\kappa$ be a stationary set. Then the combinatorial\nprinciple $\\Diamond_S$ holds if and only if there is a sequence\n$\\langle A_{\\alpha}\\rangle_{\\alpha\\in S}$ such that each\n$A_{\\alpha}\\subseteq\\alpha$ and for any $A\\subseteq\\kappa$,\n$\\{\\alpha\\in S\\mid A\\cap\\alpha=A_{\\alpha}\\}$ is stationary.\n\nTo get some sense of what this means, observe that for any\n$\\lambda<\\kappa$, $\\{\\lambda\\}\\subseteq\\kappa$, so the set of\n$A_\\alpha=\\{\\lambda\\}$ is stationary (in $\\kappa$). More strongly,\nsuppose $\\kappa>\\lambda$. Then any subset of $T\\subset\\lambda$ is\nbounded in $\\kappa$ so $A_\\alpha=T$ on a stationary set. Since\n$|S|=\\kappa$, it follows that $2^\\lambda\\leq\\kappa$. Hence\n$\\Diamond_{\\aleph_1}$, the most common form (often written as just\n$\\Diamond$), implies CH.\n\nC. Akemann and N.
