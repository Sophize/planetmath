  "definition": "### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nA *rational transducer* is a generalization of a generalized sequential\nmachine (gsm). Recall that a gsm $M$ is a quadruple\n$(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\tau)$ where $S$ is a finite set of states, $\\Sigma$\nand $\\Delta$ are the input and output alphabets respectively, and $\\tau$\nis the transition function taking an input symbol from one state to an\noutput word in another state. A rational transducer has all of the\ncomponents above, except that the transition function $\\tau$ is more\ngeneral: its domain consists of a pair of a state and an input word,\nrather than an input symbol.\n\nFormally, a *rational transducer* $M$ is a quadruple\n$(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\tau)$ where $S,\\Sigma,\\Delta$ are defined just as\nthose in a gsm, except that the transition function $\\tau$ has domain a\nfinite subset of $S\\times \\Sigma^*$ such that $\\tau(s,u)$ is finite for\neach $(s,u)\\in \\operatorname{dom}(\\tau)$. One can think of $\\tau$ as a\nfinite subset of $S\\times \\Sigma^* \\times S\\times \\Delta^*$, or\nequivalently a finite relation between $S\\times \\Sigma^*$ and\n$S\\times \\Delta^*$.\n\nLike a gsm, a rational transducer can be turned into a language acceptor\nby fixing an initial state $s_0 \\in S$ and a non-empty set $F$ of finite\nstates $F\\subseteq S$. In this case, a rational transducer turns into a\n6-tuple $(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\tau, s_0,F)$. An input configuration\n$(s_0,u)$ is said to be *initial*, and an output configuration $(t,v)$\nis said to be *final* if $t\\in F$. The language accepted by a rational\ntransducer $M$ is defined as the set\n$$L(M):=\\lbrace u\\in \\Sigma^* \\mid \\tau(s_0,u) \\mbox{ contains an final output configuration.}\\rbrace.$$\n\n### Rational Transductions {#rational-transductions .unnumbered}\n\nAdditionally, like a gsm, a rational transducer can be made into a\nlanguage translator. The initial state $s_0$ and the set $F$ of final\nstates are needed. Given a rational transducer $M$, for every input word\n$u$, let\n$$\\operatorname{RT}_M(u):=\\lbrace v \\in \\Delta^* \\mid (t,v)\\in \\tau(s_0,u) \\mbox{ is a final output configuration.}\\rbrace.$$\nThus, $\\operatorname{RT}_M$ is a function from $\\Sigma^*$ to\n$P(\\Delta^*)$, and is called the *rational transduction* (defined) for\nthe rational transducer $M$. The rational transduction for $M$ can be\nextended: for any language $L$ over the input alphabet $\\Sigma$,\n$$\\operatorname{RT}_M(L):=\\bigcup \\lbrace \\operatorname{RT}_M(u)\\mid u\\in L\\rbrace.$$\nIn this way, $\\operatorname{RT}_M$ may be thought of as a language\ntranslator.\n\nAs with GSM mappings, one can define the inverse of a rational\ntransduction, given a rational transduction $\\operatorname{RT}_M$:\n$$\\operatorname{RT}_M^{-1}(v):=\\lbrace u\\mid v\\in \\operatorname{RT}_M(u) \\rbrace \\quad\\mbox{ and }\\quad \\operatorname{RT}_M^{-1}(L):=\\bigcup \\lbrace \\operatorname{RT}_M^{-1}(v) \\mid v\\in L\\rbrace.$$\n\nHere are some examples of rational transductions\n\n-   Every GSM mapping is clearly a rational transduction, since every\n    gsm is a rational transducer. As a corollary, any homomorphism, as\n    well as intersection with any regular language, is a rational\n    transduction.\n\n-   The inverse of a rational transduction is a transduction. Given any\n    rational transducer $M=(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\tau, s_0,F)$, define a\n    rational transducer $M'=(S',\\Delta,\\Sigma,\\tau',t_0,F')$ as follws:\n    $S'=S\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\cup}\\lbrace t_0\\rbrace$ (where\n    $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\cup}$ denotes disjoint union),\n    $F'=\\lbrace s_0\\rbrace$, and\n    $\\tau' \\subseteq S\\times \\Delta^* \\times S\\times \\Sigma^*$ is given\n    by $$\\tau'(t,v) = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\lbrace (s,v)\\mid (s,v)\\mbox{ is a final output configuration of }M \\rbrace & \\textrm{if } t=t_0 \\\\\n    \\lbrace (s,u)\\mid (t,v)\\in \\tau(s,u) \\rbrace & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ As $\\tau$ is finite, so is $\\tau'$, so that $M'$ is\n    well-defined. In addition,\n    $\\operatorname{RT}_{M'}=\\operatorname{RT}_{M}^{-1}$. As a corollary,\n    the inverse homomorphism is a rational transduction.\n\n-   The composition of two rational transductions is a rational\n    transduction. To see this, suppose\n    $M_1=(S_1,\\Sigma_1,\\Delta_1, \\tau_1,s_1,F_1)$ and\n    $M_2=(S_2,\\Sigma_2,\\Delta_2,\\tau_2,s_2,F_2)$ are two rational\n    transducers such that $\\Delta_1 \\subseteq \\Sigma_2$. Define\n    $M=(S,\\Sigma_1,\\Delta_2,\\tau,s_1,F_2)$ as follows:\n    $S=S_1\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\cup} S_2$, and\n    $\\tau \\subseteq S \\times \\Sigma_1^* \\times S\\times \\Delta_2^*$ is\n    given by $$\\tau(s,u) = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n     \\tau_1(s,u) & \\textrm{if } (s,u)\\in S_1\\times \\Sigma_1^* \\\\\n     \\tau_2(s,u) & \\textrm{if } (s,u)\\in S_2\\times \\Sigma_2^* \\\\\n     \\lbrace (s_2,u)\\rbrace & \\textrm{if } (s,u)\\textrm{ is a final output configuration of } M_1 \\\\\n     \\varnothing & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ Again, since both $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$ are finite, so is\n    $\\tau$, and thus $M$ well-defined. In addition,\n    $\\operatorname{RT}_M=\\operatorname{RT}_{M_2} \\circ \\operatorname{RT}_{M_1}$.\n\nA family $\\mathscr{F}$ of languages is said to be closed under rational\ntransduction if for every $L\\in \\mathscr{F}$, and any rational\ntransducer $M$, we have $\\operatorname{RT}_M(L)\\in \\mathscr{F}$. The\nthree properties above show that if $\\mathscr{F}$ is closed under\nrational transduction, it is a cone. The converse is also true, as it\ncan be shown that every rational transduction can be expressed as a\ncomposition of inverse homomorphism, intersection with a regular\nlanguage, and homomorphism. Thus, a family of languages being closed\nunder rational transduction completely characterizes a cone.\n\n[9]{} A.
