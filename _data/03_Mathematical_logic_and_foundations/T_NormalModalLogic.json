  "definition": "The study of modal logic is based on the concept of a *logic*, which is\na set $\\Lambda$ of wff\u2019s satisfying the following:\n\n-   contains all tautologies, and\n\n-   is closed under modus ponens.\n\nThe last condition means: if $A$ and $A\\to B$ are in $\\Lambda$, so is\n$B$ in $\\Lambda$.\n\nA *normal modal logic* is a modal logic $\\Lambda$ that includes the *law\nof distribution* K (after Kripke):\n$$\\square (A\\to B)\\to (\\square A \\to \\square B)$$ as an axiom schema,\nand obeying the *rule of necessitation* $RN$:\n\nfrom $\\vdash A$, we may infer $\\vdash \\square A$: if $A\\in \\Lambda$,\nthen $\\square A \\in \\Lambda$.\n\nNormal modal logics are the most widely studied modal logics. The\nsmallest normal modal logic is called **K**. Other normal modal logics\nare built from **K** by attaching wff\u2019s as axiom schemas. Below is a\nlist of schemas used to form some of the most common normal modal\nlogics:\n\n[2]{}\n\n-   4: $\\square A\\to \\square \\square A$\n\n-   5: $\\Diamond A \\to \\square \\Diamond A$\n\n-   D: $\\square A \\to \\Diamond A$\n\n-   T: $\\square A \\to A$\n\n-   B: $A\\to \\square \\Diamond A$\n\n-   C: $\\square (A\\wedge \\square B)\\to \\square (A\\wedge B)$\n\n-   M: $\\square (A\\wedge B)\\to \\square A\\wedge \\square B$\n\n-   G: $\\Diamond \\square A \\to \\square \\Diamond A$\n\n-   L:\n    $\\square (A\\wedge \\square A \\to B) \\vee \\square (B\\wedge \\square B \\to A)$\n\n-   W: $\\square (\\square A \\to A) \\to \\square A$\n\nFor example, the normal modal logic **D** is the smallest normal modal\nlogic containing $D$ as its axiom schema.\n\n**Notation**. The smallest normal modal logic containing schemas\n$\\Sigma_1,\\ldots, \\Sigma_n$ is typically denoted\n\n**K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma_1 \\cdots \\Sigma_n}$.\n\nIt is easy to see that **K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma_1 \\cdots \\Sigma_n}$ can be\nbuilt from the \u201cbottom up\u201d: call a finite sequence of wff\u2019s a deduction\nif each wff is either a tautology, an instance of $\\Sigma_i$ for some\n$i$, or as a result of an application of modus ponens or necessitation\non earlier wff\u2019s in the sequence. A wff is deducible from if it is the\nlast member of some deduction. Let $\\Lambda_k$ be the set of all wff\u2019s\ndeducible from deductions of lengths at most $k$. Then\n\n**K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma_1 \\cdots \\Sigma_n} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\Lambda_i$\n\nBelow are some of the most common normal modal logics:\n\n     name     **D**    **T**     **B**    **S4**    **S5**    **GL**   **K4.3**   **S4.3**\n  ---------- -------- -------- --------- --------- --------- -------- ---------- ----------\n   notation   **KD**   **KT**   **KTB**   **KT4**   **KT5**   **KW**   **K4L**    **KT4L**\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   **D** is commonly used in the study of deontic logic (logic of\n    obligation). Extensions of **D** such as **KD4** and **KD45** are\n    used in the study of doxastic logic (logic of belief).\n\n-   **GL** is known as provability logic, where $\\square A$ means $A$ is\n    provable in Peano arithmetic.\n\n-   **S4** and **S5** are two of the Lewis\u2019 5 modal logical systems.\n    They are commonly used in the study of epistemic logic (logic of\n    knowledge). The modal logics **S1**, **S2**, and **S3** are\n    non-normal.\n\n### Semantics {#semantics .unnumbered}\n\nThe dominant semantics for normal modal logic is the Kripke semantics,\nor relational semantics. More on this can be found . A logic is *sound*\nin a class of frames if every theorem is valid in every frame in the\nclass, and *complete* if any formula valid in every frame in the class\nis a theorem. When a logic $\\Lambda$ is both sound and complete in a\nclass $\\mathcal{C}$ of frames, we say that $\\mathcal{C}$ *describes*\n$\\Lambda$.\n\nThe following table lists the logics **K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ and the\ncorresponding sound and complete classes of (Kripke) frames:\n\n   $\\Sigma$ in **K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$   frame **K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ is sound in   frame **K**$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ is complete in\n  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------\n                   4                                   transitive                                  transitive\n                   5                                   Euclidean                                    Euclidean\n                   D                                     serial                                      serial\n                   T                                   reflexive                                    reflexive\n                   B                                   symmetric                                    symmetric\n                   G                                weakly directed                              weakly directed\n                   L                                weakly connected                            weakly connected\n                   W                      transitive and converse well-founded          finite transitive and irreflexive",
