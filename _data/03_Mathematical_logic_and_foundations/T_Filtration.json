  "definition": "A [*filtration*]{} is a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ with\n$$A_1 \\subset A_2 \\subset \\cdots \\subset A_n.$$ If one considers the\nsets $A_1, \\dots, A_n$ as elements of a larger set which are partially\nordered by inclusion, then a filtration is simply a finite chain with\nrespect to this partial ordering. It should be noted that in some\ncontexts the word \u201cfiltration\u201d may also be employed to describe an\ninfinite chain.",
