  "definition": "Galileo Galilei (1564\u20141642) has realised the ostensible contradiction in\nthe situation, that although the set $$1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,4,\\,5,\\,\\ldots$$ of\nthe positive integers all the members of the set\n$$1,\\,4,\\,9,\\,16,\\,\\ldots$$ of the perfect squares and in many others,\nhowever both sets are equally great in the sense that any member of the\nformer set has as its square a unique counterpart in the latter set and\nalso any member of the latter set has as its square root a unique\ncounterpart in the former set. Galileo explained this by the infinitude\nof the sets.\n\nIn modern mathematical , we say that an infinite set and its proper\nsubset set may have the same cardinality.",
