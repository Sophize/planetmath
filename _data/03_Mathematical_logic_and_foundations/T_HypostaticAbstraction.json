  "definition": "**Hypostatic abstraction** is a formal operation that takes an element\nof information, as expressed in a proposition $X\\ \\operatorname{is}\\ Y,$\nand conceives its information to consist in the relation between that\nsubject and another subject, as expressed in the proposition\n$X\\ \\operatorname{has}\\ Y\\!\\operatorname{-ness}.$ The existence of the\nabstract subject $Y\\!\\operatorname{-ness}$ consists solely in the truth\nof those propositions that contain the concrete predicate $Y.$\nHypostatic abstraction is known under many names, for example,\n*hypostasis*, *objectification*, *reification*, and *subjectal\nabstraction*. The object of discussion or thought thus introduced is\ntermed a *hypostatic object*.\n\nThe above definition is adapted from one given by Charles Sanders Peirce\n(CP 4.235). The main thing about the formal operation of hypostatic\nabstraction, insofar as it can be observed to operate on formal\nlinguistic expressions, is that it converts an adjective or some part of\na predicate into an extra subject, upping the arity of the main\npredicate in the process.\n\nFor example, a typical case of hypostatic abstraction occurs in the\ntransformation from \u201choney is sweet\" to \u201choney possesses sweetness\",\nwhich transformation can be viewed in the following variety of ways:\n\n  -----------------------------\n       ![image](HA_Fig_1)\n   \\[24pt\\] ![image](HA_Fig_2)\n   \\[24pt\\] ![image](HA_Fig_3)\n   \\[24pt\\] ![image](HA_Fig_4)\n  -----------------------------\n\nThe grammatical trace of this hypostatic transformation tells of a\nprocess that abstracts the adjective \u201csweet\" from the predicate \u201cis\nsweet\", decants the higher-arity predicate \u201cpossesses\", and precipitates\nthe substantive \u201csweetness\" in the role of its correlative subject.\n\nReferences and further reading\n==============================\n\n-   Peirce, Charles Sanders (1902), \u201cThe Simplest Mathematics\", CP\n    4.227\u2013323 in *Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce*, vols.\n    1\u20136, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (eds.), vols. 7\u20138, Arthur W.\n    Burks (ed.), Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA,\n    1931\u20131935, 1958.
