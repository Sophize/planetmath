  "definition": "The *arithmetical hierarchy* is a hierarchy of either (depending on the\ncontext) formulas or relations. The relations of a particular level of\nthe hierarchy are exactly the relations defined by the formulas of that\nlevel, so the two uses are essentially the same.\n\nThe first level consists of formulas with only bounded quantifiers, the\ncorresponding relations are also called the Primitive Recursive\nrelations (this definition is equivalent to the definition from computer\nscience). This level is called any of $\\Delta^0_0$, $\\Sigma^0_0$ and\n$\\Pi^0_0$, depending on context.\n\nA formula $\\phi$ is $\\Sigma^0_n$ if there is some $\\Delta^0_0$ formula\n$\\psi$ such that $\\phi$ can be written:\n\n$$\\phi(\\vec k)=\\exists x_1\\forall x_2\\cdots {Q}x_n\\psi(\\vec k,\\vec x)$$\n$$\\text{ where }Q\\text{ is either }\\forall\\text{ or }\\exists\\text{, whichever maintains the pattern of alternating quantifiers}$$\n\nThe $\\Sigma^0_1$ relations are the same as the Recursively Enumerable\nrelations.\n\nSimilarly, $\\phi$ is a $\\Pi^0_n$ relation if there is some $\\Delta^0_0$\nformula $\\psi$ such that:\n$$\\phi(\\vec k)=\\forall x_1\\exists x_2\\cdots Q x_n\\psi(\\vec k,\\vec x)$$\n$$\\text{ where }Q\\text{ is either }\\forall\\text{ or }\\exists\\text{, whichever maintains the pattern of alternating quantifiers}$$\n\nA formula is $\\Delta^0_n$ if it is both $\\Sigma^0_n$ and $\\Pi^0_n$.\nSince each $\\Sigma^0_n$ formula is just the negation of a $\\Pi^0_n$\nformula and vice-versa, the $\\Sigma^0_n$ relations are the complements\nof the $\\Pi^0_n$ relations.\n\nThe relations in $\\Delta^0_1 = \\Sigma^0_1 \\cap \\Pi^0_1$ are the\nRecursive relations.\n\nHigher levels on the hierarchy correspond to broader and broader classes\nof relations. A formula or relation which is $\\Sigma^0_n$ (or,\nequivalently, $\\Pi^0_n$) for some integer $n$ is called *arithmetical*.\n\nThe superscript $0$ is often omitted when it is not necessary to\ndistinguish from the analytic hierarchy.\n\nFunctions can be described as being in one of the levels of the\nhierarchy if the graph of the function is in that level.",
