  "definition": "Weakly compact cardinals are (large) infinite cardinals which have a\nproperty related to the syntactic compactness theorem for first order\nlogic. Specifically, for any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, consider the\nlanguage $L_{\\kappa,\\kappa}$.\n\nThis language is identical to first logic except that:\n\n-   infinite conjunctions and disjunctions of fewer than $\\kappa$\n    formulas are allowed\n\n-   infinite strings of fewer than $\\kappa$ quantifiers are allowed\n\nThe weak compactness theorem for $L_{\\kappa,\\kappa}$ states that if\n$\\Delta$ is a set of sentences of $L_{\\kappa,\\kappa}$ such that\n$|\\Delta|=\\kappa$ and any $\\theta\\subset\\Delta$ with $|\\theta|<\\kappa$\nis consistent then $\\Delta$ is consistent.\n\nA cardinal is weakly compact if the weak compactness theorem holds for\n$L_{\\kappa,\\kappa}$.",
