  "definition": "Let $R$ be a binary relation. Then the set of all $y$ such that $x R y$\nfor some $x$ is called the *range* of $R$. That is, the range of $R$ is\nthe set of all second coordinates in the ordered pairs of $R$.\n\nIn of functions, this means that the range of a function is the full set\nof values it can take on (the outputs), given the full set of parameters\n(the inputs). Note that the range is a subset of the codomain.",
