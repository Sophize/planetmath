  "definition": "A semi-Thue system $\\mathfrak{S}=(\\Sigma,R)$ is said to be a *Thue\nsystem* if $R$ is a symmetric relation on $\\Sigma^*$. In other words, if\n$x\\to y$ is a defining relation in $R$, then so is $y\\to x$.\n\nLike a semi-Thue system, we can define the concepts of immediately\nderivable and derivable pairs. Let $R'$ and $R''$ be the respective\ncollections of these pairs. Since $R$ is symmetric, so is $R'$ and\nconsequently $R''$. Similarly, the notations are: for elements\n$(a,b)\\in R'$, we write $a\\Rightarrow b$, and for elements\n$(c,d)\\in R''$, we write $a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$.\n\nIf we regard $\\Sigma^*$ as a free monoid with concatenation $\\cdot$ as\nmultiplication and the empty word $\\lambda$ as the multiplicative\nidentity, then ${\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}$ is a congruence relation on\n$\\Sigma^*$: it is an equivalence relation and respects concatenation,\nmeaning that if $a{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}b$ and\n$c{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}d$, then $ac{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}bd$.\nTherefore, we can take the quotent\n$\\Sigma^*/{\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow}}$ and the resulting set of\nequivalence classes is again a monoid with $[\\lambda]$ as the\nmultiplicative identity. It is a monoid generated by $[a]$ whenever\n$a\\in \\Sigma$ with relations $[u]=[v]$ whenever $u\\to v$ is a defining\nrelation in $R$. Thus, two elements are in the same equivalence class if\none is derivable from another. Let us denote this monoid by\n$[\\Sigma]_{\\mathfrak{S}}$.\n\nNow let $\\mathfrak{S}=(\\Sigma,R)$ be a Thue system. Then $\\mathfrak{S}$\nis called a *group system* if there exists an involution $^{-1}$ on\n$\\Sigma$ given by $a\\mapsto a^{-1}$, and that for every $a\\in \\Sigma$,\n$aa^{-1}\\to \\lambda$ is a defining relation in $R$. Since $^{-1}$ is an\ninvolution, if $b$ is the symbol in $\\Sigma$ such that $b=a^{-1}$, then\n$b^{-1}=a$. So $a^{-1}a = ba= bb^{-1} \\to \\lambda$ also. In fact, it is\nnot hard to see that for a group system $\\mathfrak{S}$,\n$[\\Sigma]_{\\mathfrak{S}}$ is the group with generators $[a]$ whenever\n$a\\in \\Sigma$ and with relators $[u][v]^{-1}$ whenever $u\\to v$ is a\ndefining relation in $R$. Every non-trivial element in\n$[\\Sigma]_{\\mathfrak{S}}$ has an expression\n$[a_1]^{p_1}\\cdots [a_n]^{p_n}$, where each $a_i$ is a letter in\n$\\Sigma$ such that it is distinct from its neighbors ($a_i\\ne a_{i+1}$),\nand $p_i$ are non-zero integers. This expression is unique in the sense\nthat it is \u201creduced\u201d. See reduced words for more detail.\n\n**Remark**. Like the word problem for semi-Thue systems, the word\nproblem for Thue systems and group systems can be similarly posed. It\ncan be shown that the word problem for Thue systems and group systems\nare both unsolvable. As a result, the corresponding word problems for\nsemigroups and for groups are also unsolvable.\n\n[9]{} M. Davis, [*Computability and Unsolvability*]{}. Dover\nPublications, New York (1982). H.
