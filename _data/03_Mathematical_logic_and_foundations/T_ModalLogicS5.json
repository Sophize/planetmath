  "definition": "The modal logic **S5** is the smallest normal modal logic containing the\nfollowing schemas:\n\n-   \\(T) $\\square A \\to A$, and\n\n-   \\(5) $\\diamond A \\to \\square \\diamond A$.\n\n**S5** is also denoted by **KT5**, where $\\textbf{T}$ and $\\textbf{5}$\ncorrespond to the schemas T and 5 respectively.\n\nIn , we show that T is valid in a frame iff the frame is reflexive.\n\nA binary relation $R$ on a set $W$ is said to be *Euclidean* iff for any\n$u,v,w$, $u R v$ and $u R w$ imply $v R w$. $R$ being Euclidean is\nfirst-order definable:\n$$\\forall u \\forall v \\forall w ((u R v \\land u R w) \\to v R w).$$\n\n5 is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$ iff $\\mathcal{F}$ is Euclidean.\n\nFirst, let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a frame validating 5. Suppose $w R x$ and\n$w R y$. Let $M$ be a model based on $\\mathcal{F}$, with\n$V(p)=\\lbrace x \\rbrace$. Since $\\models_x p$, we have\n$\\models_w \\diamond p$, and so $\\models_w \\square \\diamond p$, or\n$\\models_u \\diamond p$ for all $u$ such that $w R u$. In particular,\n$\\models_y \\diamond p$. So there is a $z$ such that $y R z$ and\n$\\models_z p$. But this means $z=x$, whence $y R x$, meaning $R$ is\nEuclidean.\n\nConversely, suppose $\\mathcal{F}$ is a Euclidean frame, and $M$ a model\nbased on $\\mathcal{F}$. Suppose $\\models_w \\diamond A$. Then there is a\n$v$ such that $w R v$ and $\\models_v A$. Now, for any $u$ with $w R u$,\nwe have $u R v$ since $R$ is Euclidean. So $\\models_u \\diamond A$. Since\n$u$ is arbitrary, $\\models_w \\square \\diamond A$, and therefore\n$\\models_w \\diamond A \\to \\square \\diamond A$.\n\nNow, a relation is both reflexive and Euclidean iff it is an equivalence\nrelation:\n\nSuppose $R$ is both reflexive and Euclidean. If $a R b$, since $a R a$,\n$b R a$ so $R$ is symmetric. If $a R b$ and $b R c$, then $b R a$ since\n$R$ has just been proven symmetric, and therefore $a R c$, or $R$ is\ntransitive. Conversely, suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation. If\n$a R b$ and $a R c$, then $b R a$ since $R$ is symmetric, so that\n$b R c$ since $R$ is transitive. Hence $R$ is Euclidean.\n\nThis also shows that\n\n**S5** $=$ **KTB4**,\n\nwhere B is the schema $A\\to \\square \\diamond A$, valid in any symmetric\nframe (see ), and 4 is the schema $\\square A \\to \\square \\square A$,\nvalid in any transitive frame (see ). It is also not hard to show that\n\n**S5** $=$ **KDB4** $=$ **KDB5**,\n\nwhere $D$ is the schema $\\square A \\to \\diamond A$, valid in any serial\nframe (see ).\n\nAs a result,\n\n**S5** is sound in the class of equivalence frames.\n\nSince any theorem $A$ in **S5** is deducible from a finite sequence\nconsisting of tautologies, which are valid in any frame, instances of T,\nwhich are valid in reflexive frames, instances of 5, which are valid in\nEuclidean frames by the proposition above, and applications of modus\nponens and necessitation, both of which preserve validity in any frame,\n$A$ is valid in any frame which is both reflexive and Euclidean, and\nhence an equivalence frame.\n\nIn addition, using the canonical model of **S5**, which is based on an\nequivalence frame, we have\n\n**S5** is complete in the class of equivalence frames.\n\nBy the discussion above, it is enough to show that the canonical frame\nof **S5** is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Since $\\textbf{S5}$\ncontains T, B, and 4, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\textbf{S5}}$ is reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive respectively, the proofs of which can be found\nin the corresponding entries on **T**, **B**, and **S4**.\n\n**Remark**. Alternatively, one can also show that the canonical frame of\nthe consistent normal logic containing 5 must be Euclidean.\n\nLet $\\Lambda$ be such a logic. Suppose $u R_{\\Lambda} v$ and\n$u R_{\\Lambda} w$. We want to show that $v R_{\\Lambda} w$, or\n$\\Delta_v:=\\lbrace B\\mid \\square B\\in v\\rbrace \\subseteq w$. Let $A$ be\nany wff. If $A\\notin w$, $A\\notin \\Delta_u$ since $u R_{\\Lambda} v$, so\n$\\square A \\notin u$ by the definition of $\\Delta_u$, or\n$\\neg \\square A\\in u$ since $u$ is maximal, or $\\diamond \\neg A \\in u$\nby substitution theorem on\n$\\neg \\square A \\leftrightarrow \\diamond \\neg A$, or\n$\\square \\diamond \\neg A \\in u$ by modus ponens on 5 and the fact that\n$u$ is closed under modus ponens. This means that\n$\\diamond \\neg A \\in \\Delta_u$ by the definition of $\\Delta_u$, or\n$\\diamond \\neg A \\in v$ since $u R_{\\Lambda} v$, so that\n$\\neg \\square A \\in v$ by the substitution theorem on\n$\\diamond \\neg A\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\square A$, which means\n$\\square A\\notin v$ since $v$ is maximal, or $A\\notin \\Delta_v$ by the\ndefinition of $\\Delta_v$.",
