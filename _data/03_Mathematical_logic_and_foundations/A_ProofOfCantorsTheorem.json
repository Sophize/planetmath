  "argumentText": "The proof of this theorem is fairly using the following construction,\nwhich is central to Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument.\n\nConsider a function $F\\colon X\\to \\P(X)$ from a set $X$ to its power\nset. Then we define the set $Z\\sse X$ as follows:\n\n$$Z = \\{x\\in X \\mid x\\not\\in F(x)\\}$$\n\nSuppose that $F$ is a bijection. Then there must exist an $x\\in X$ such\nthat $F(x)=Z$. Then we have the following contradiction:\n\n$$x\\in Z \\equiv x\\not\\in F(x) \\equiv x\\not\\in Z$$\n\nHence, $F$ cannot be a bijection between $X$ and $\\P(X)$.",
