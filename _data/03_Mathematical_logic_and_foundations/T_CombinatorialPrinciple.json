  "definition": "A *combinatorial principle* is any statement $\\Phi$ of set theory proved\nto be independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, usually one with\ninteresting consequences.\n\nIf $\\Phi$ is a combinatorial principle, then whenever we have\nimplications of the form $$P\\implies \\Phi\\implies Q,$$ we automatically\nknow that $P$ is unprovable in ZF and $Q$ is relatively consistent with\nZF.\n\nSome examples of combinatorial principles are the , the continuum\nhypothesis, $\\Diamond$, $\\clubsuit$, and Martin\u2019s axiom.\n\n[9]{} Just, W., .",
