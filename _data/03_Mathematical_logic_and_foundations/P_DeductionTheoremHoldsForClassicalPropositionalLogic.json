  "statement": "In this entry, we prove that the deduction theorem holds for classical\npropositional logic. For the logic, we use the axiom system found in .\nTo prove the theorem, we use the theorem schema $A\\to A$ (whose\ndeduction can be found ).\n\nSuppose $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ is a deduction of $B$ from\n$\\Delta \\cup \\lbrace A \\rbrace$. We want to find a deduction of $A\\to B$\nfrom $\\Delta$. There are two main cases to consider:\n\n-   If $B$ is an axiom or in $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$, then\n    $$B, B\\to (A\\to B), A\\to B$$ is a deduction of $A\\to B$ from\n    $\\Delta$, where $A\\to B$ is obtained by modus ponens applied to $B$\n    and the axiom $B\\to (A\\to B)$. So $\\Delta \\vdash A\\to B$.\n\n-   If $B$ is obtained from $A_i$ and $A_j$ by modus ponens. Then $A_j$,\n    say, is $A_i \\to B$. We use induction on the length $n$ of the\n    deduction of $B$. Note that $n\\ge 3$. If $n=3$, then the first two\n    formulas are $C$ and $C\\to B$.\n\n    -   If $C$ is $A$, then $C\\to B$ is either an axiom or in $\\Delta$.\n        So $A\\to B$, which is just $C\\to B$, is a deduction of $A\\to B$\n        from $\\Delta$.\n\n    -   If $C\\to B$ is $A$, then $C$ is either an axiom or in $\\Delta$,\n        and\n        $$\\mathcal{E}_0,(A\\to A)\\to ((A\\to C) \\to (A\\to B)),C\\to(A\\to C),C,A\\to C, A\\to B$$\n        is a deduction of $A\\to B$ from $\\Delta$, where $\\mathcal{E}_0$\n        is a deduction of $A\\to A$, followed by two axiom instances,\n        followed by $C$, followed by results of two applications of\n        modus ponens.\n\n    -   If both $C$ and $C\\to B$ are either axioms are in $\\Delta$, then\n        $$C, C\\to B, B, B\\to (A\\to B), A\\to B$$ is a deduction of\n        $A\\to B$ from $\\Delta$.\n\n    Next, assume the deduction $\\mathcal{E}$ of $B$ has length $n>3$. A\n    subsequence of $\\mathcal{E}$ is a deduction of $A_i \\to B$ from\n    $\\Delta \\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$. This deduction has length less than\n    $n$, so by induction, $$\\Delta \\vdash A \\to (A_i\\to B),$$ and\n    therefore by $(A \\to (A_i\\to B)) \\to ((A\\to A_i)\\to (A\\to B))$, an\n    axiom instance, and modus ponens,\n    $$\\Delta \\vdash (A\\to A_i)\\to (A\\to B).$$ Likewise, a subsequence of\n    $\\mathcal{E}$ is a deduction of $A_i$, so by induction,\n    $\\Delta \\vdash A \\to A_i$. Therefore, an application of modus ponens\n    gives us $\\Delta \\vdash A\\to B$.\n\nIn both cases, $\\Delta \\vdash A\\to B$ and we are done.\n\nWe record two corollaries:\n\n(Proof by Contradiction). If $\\Delta, A \\vdash \\perp$, then\n$\\Delta \\vdash \\neg A$.\n\nFrom $\\Delta, A \\vdash \\perp$, we have $\\Delta \\vdash A\\to \\perp$ by the\ndeduction theorem. Since $\\neg A \\leftrightarrow \\perp$, the result\nfollows.\n\n(Proof by Contrapositive). If $\\Delta, A \\vdash \\neg B$, then\n$\\Delta, B \\vdash \\neg A$.\n\nIf $\\Delta, A \\vdash \\neg B$, then $\\Delta, A,B \\vdash \\perp$ by the\ndeduction thereom, and therefore $\\Delta, B \\vdash \\neg A$ by the\ndeduction theorem again.\n\n**Remark** The deduction theorem for the classical propositional logic\ncan be used to prove the deduction theorem for the classical first and\nsecond order predicate logic.\n\n[7]{} J.
