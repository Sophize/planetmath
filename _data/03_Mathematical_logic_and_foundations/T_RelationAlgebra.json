  "definition": "It is a well-known fact that if $A$ is a set, then $P(A)$ the power set\nof $A$, equipped with the intersection operation $\\cap$, the union\noperation $\\cup$, and the complement operation $'$ turns $P(A)$ into a\nBoolean algebra. Indeed, a Boolean algebra can be viewed as an\nabstraction of the family of subsets of a set with the usual\nset-theoretic operations. The algebraic abstraction of the set of binary\nrelations on a set is what is known as a *relation algebra*.\n\nBefore defining formally what a relation algebra is, let us recall the\nfollowing facts about binary relations on some given set $A$:\n\n-   binary relations are closed under $\\cap,\\cup$ and $'$, and in fact,\n    satisfy all the axioms of a Boolean algebra. In short, the set\n    $R(A)$ of binary relations on $A$ is a Boolean algebra, where\n    $A\\times A$ is the top and\n    $\\varnothing\\times \\varnothing (=\\varnothing) $ is the bottom of\n    $R(A)$;\n\n-   if $R$ and $S$ are binary relations on $A$, then so are $R\\circ S$,\n    relation composition of $R$ and $S$, and $R^{-1}$, the inverse of\n    $R$;\n\n-   $I_A$, defined by $\\lbrace (a,a)\\mid a\\in A\\rbrace$, is a binary\n    relation which is also the identity with respect to $\\circ$, also\n    known as the identity relation on $A$;\n\n-   some familiar identities:\n\n    1.  $R\\circ (S\\circ T) = (R\\circ S)\\circ T$\n\n    2.  $(R^{-1})^{-1}=R$\n\n    3.  $(R\\circ S)^{-1} = S^{-1}\\circ R^{-1}$\n\n    4.  $(R\\cup S)\\circ T= (R\\circ T)\\cup (S\\circ T)$\n\n    5.  $(R\\cup S)^{-1}=R^{-1}\\cup S^{-1}$\n\nIn addition, there is also a rule that is true for all binary relations\non $A$: $$\\begin{aligned}\n(R\\circ S)\\cap T=\\varnothing\\quad \\mbox{ iff } \\quad (R^{-1}\\circ T)\\cap S = \\varnothing\\end{aligned}$$\nThe verification of this rule is as follows: first note that sufficiency\nimplies necessity, for if $(R^{-1}\\circ T)\\cap S = \\varnothing$, then\n$(R\\circ S)\\cap T=((R^{-1})^{-1}\\circ S)\\cap T=\\varnothing$. To show\nsufficiency, suppose $(a,b)\\in S$ is also an element of $R^{-1}\\circ T$.\nThen there is $c\\in A$ such that $(a,c)\\in R^{-1}$ and $(c,b)\\in T$.\nTherefore, $(c,a)\\in R$ and $(c,b)=(c,a)\\circ (a,b)\\in R\\circ S$ as\nwell. This shows that $(R\\circ S)\\cap T\\ne \\varnothing$.\n\nIt can be shown that Rule (1) is equivalent to the following inclusion\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nR^{-1}\\circ(R\\circ S)'\\subseteq S'.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n**Definition**. A *relation algebra* is a Boolean algebra $B$ with the\nusual Boolean operators $\\vee, \\wedge, '$, and additionally a binary\noperator $\\ ;$, a unary operator $^-$, and a constant $i$ such that\n\n1.  $a\\ ;i=a$\n\n2.  $a\\ ;(b\\ ; c)=(a\\ ;b)\\ ;c$\n\n3.  $a^{--}=a$\n\n4.  $(a\\ ;b)^-=b^-\\ ;a^-$\n\n5.  $(a \\vee b)\\ ; c=(a\\ ; c)\\vee (b\\ ; c)$\n\n6.  $(a \\vee b)^- = a^- \\vee b^-$\n\n7.  $a^- \\ ; (a\\ ; b)'\\le b'$\n\nwhere $\\le$ is the induced partial order in the underlying Boolean\nalgebra.\n\nClearly, the set of all binary relations $R(A)$ on a set $A$ is a\nrelation algebra, as we have just demonstrated. Specifically, in $R(A)$,\n$\\ ;$ is the composition operator $\\circ$, $^-$ is the inverse (or\nconverse) operator $^{-1}$, and $i$ is $I_A$.\n\nA relation algebra is an algebraic system. As an algebraic system, we\ncan define the usual algebraic notions, such as subalgebras of an\nalgebra, homomorphisms between two algebras, etc... A relation algebra\n$B$ that is a subalgebra of $R(A)$, the set of all binary relations on a\nset $A$, is called a *set relation algebra*.\n\n[8]{} S. R.
