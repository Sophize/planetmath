  "definition": "Let $A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ be an automaton. Define the Kleene star\n$A^*$ of $A$ as an $(S_1,\\Sigma,\\delta_1, I_1,F_1,\\epsilon)$ where\n\n1.  $S_1=S\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\cup} \\lbrace q\\rbrace$ (we either assume\n    that $q$ is not a symbol in $\\Sigma$, or we take the disjoint union)\n\n2.  $\\delta_1$ is a function from\n    $S_1\\times (\\Sigma\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\cup} \\lbrace \\epsilon\\rbrace)$\n    to $P(S_1)$ given by:\n\n    -   $\\delta_1(s,\\epsilon):=I$ if $s=q$,\n        $\\delta_1(s,\\epsilon):=\\lbrace q\\rbrace$ for any $s\\in F$,\n\n    -   $\\delta_1(s,\\alpha):=\\delta(s,\\alpha)$, for any\n        $(s,\\alpha)\\in S\\times \\Sigma$, and\n\n    -   $\\delta_1(s,\\alpha):=\\varnothing$ otherwise.\n\n3.  $I_1=F_1=\\lbrace q\\rbrace$\n\nBasically, we throw into $A^*$ all transitions in $A$. In addition, we\nadd to $A^*$ transitions taking $s$ to any initial states of $A$, as\nwell as transitions taking any final states of $A$ to $s$. Visually, the\nstate diagram $G_{A^*}$ of $A^*$ is obtained by adding a node $q$ to the\nstate diagram $G_A$ of $A$, and making $q$ both the start and the final\nnode of $G_{A^*}$. Furthermore, add edges from $q$ to the start nodes of\n$G_A$, and edges from the final nodes of $G_A$ to $q$, and let\n$\\epsilon$ be the label for all of the newly added edges.\n\n$L(A)^*=L(A^*)$.\n\nClearly $\\lambda \\in L(A)*$. In addition, since $I_1=F_1$,\n$\\lambda \\in L(A^*_{\\epsilon})=L(A^*)$. This proves the case when the\nword is empty. Now, we move to the case when the word has non-zero\nlength.\n\n-   $L(A)^*\\subseteq L(A^*)$.\n\n    Suppose $a=a_1a_2\\cdots a_n$ is a word such that $a_i\\in L(A)$, then\n    we claim that $b=b_1b_2\\cdots b_n$, where\n    $b_i=\\epsilon a_i \\epsilon$, is accepted by $A^*_{\\epsilon}$. This\n    can be proved by induction on $n$:\n\n    1.  First, $n=1$. Then\n        $$\\delta_1(q, b_1) = \\delta_1(\\delta_1(q, \\epsilon), a_1\\epsilon) = \\delta_1(I,a_1\\epsilon) = \\delta_1(\\delta_1(I,a_1),\\epsilon).$$\n        Since $a_1$ is accepted by $A$, $\\delta_1(I,a_1)=\\delta(I,a_1)$\n        contains an accepting state $s\\in F$, so that\n        $$q\\in \\delta_1(s,\\epsilon)\\subseteq \\delta_1( \\delta_1(I,a_1), \\epsilon).$$\n        Hence $b_1$ is accepted by $A^*_{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    2.  Next, suppose that given $b=b_1\\cdots b_n$, the subword\n        $b_1 \\cdots b_{n-1}$ (induction step) is accepted by\n        $A^*_{\\epsilon}$. This means that\n        $q\\in \\delta_1 (q, b_1 \\cdots b_{n-1})$, so that\n        $$\\delta_1(q, b_n) \\subseteq \\delta_1(\\delta_1(q, b_1 \\cdots b_{n-1} ), b_n) = \\delta_1(q, b_1 \\cdots b_n).$$\n        But $\\delta_1(q,b_n)$ contains $q$ as was shown in step 1 above.\n        As a result, $b_1 \\cdots b_n $ is accepted by $A^*_{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    This shows that $L(A)^*\\subseteq L(A^*)$.\n\n-   $L(A^*)\\subseteq L(A)^*$.\n\n    Suppose now that $a$ is a word over $\\Sigma$ accepted by $A^*$. This\n    means that, for some $i_j$, $j=0,1,\\ldots ,n$, the word\n    $$b:=\\epsilon^{i_0} a_1 \\epsilon^{i_1} \\cdots \\epsilon^{i_{n-1}} a_n \\epsilon^{i_n}$$\n    is accepted by $A^*_{\\epsilon}$, where each $a_j$ is a word over\n    $\\Sigma$ with $a=a_1\\cdots a_n$. We want to show that each $a_j$ is\n    accepted by $A$.\n\n    The main thing is to notice is that if $q\\in \\delta_1(J,\\epsilon^i)$\n    and $J\\subseteq S$, where $i$ is a positive integer, then $J$ must\n    contain a state in $F$. Otherwise, $J\\subseteq S-F$, so that\n    $\\delta_1(J,\\epsilon)=\\varnothing$, and we must have\n    $\\delta_1(J,\\epsilon^i) = \\delta_1(\\delta_1(J,\\epsilon),\\epsilon^{i-1}) = \\delta_1(\\varnothing, \\epsilon^{i-1}) =\\varnothing$.\n\n    Set\n    $J = \\delta_1(q,\\epsilon^{i_0} a_1 \\epsilon^{i_1} \\cdots \\epsilon^{i_{n-1}} a_n)$\n    and\n    $K=\\delta_1(q,\\epsilon^{i_0} a_1 \\epsilon^{i_1} \\cdots \\epsilon^{i_{n-1}})$.\n    Then $J = \\delta_1(K,a_n) = \\delta(K,a_n) \\subseteq S$. Furthermore,\n    by assumption $q\\in \\delta_1(q,b)=\\delta_1(J, \\epsilon^{i_n})$.\n    Therefore, $J$ must contain a state in $F$. Thus, $a_n$ is accepted\n    by $A$. The fact that the remaining $a_i$\u2019s are accepted by $A$ is\n    proved inductively.\n\n    This shows that $L(A^*)\\subseteq L(A)^*$.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
