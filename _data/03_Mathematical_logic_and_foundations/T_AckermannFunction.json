  "definition": "Ackermann\u2019s function $A(x,y)$ is defined by the recurrence relations\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& A(0,y) & = y + 1  \\\\\n& A(x+1,0) & = A(x,1)  \\\\\n& A(x+1,y+1) & = A(x,A(x+1,y)) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nAckermann\u2019s function is an example of a recursive function that is not\nprimitive recursive, but is instead $\\mu$-recursive (that is,\nTuring-computable).\n\nAckermann\u2019s function grows extremely fast. In fact, we find that\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nA(0,y) & = & y + 1 \\\\\nA(1,y) & = & 2+(y+3) -3 \\\\\nA(2,y) & = & 2\\cdot (y+3) - 3 \\\\\nA(3,y) & = & 2^{y+3} - 3 \\\\\nA(4,y) & = & 2^{2^{{\\ldotp\\cdotp}^2}} - 3  \\;\\;\\;\\; (y + 3 \\text{ exponentiations})\\\\\n\\cdots\\end{aligned}$$\n\n... and at this point conventional notation breaks down, and we need to\nemploy something like Conway notation or Knuth notation for large\nnumbers.\n\nAckermann\u2019s function wasn\u2019t actually written in this form by its\nnamesake, Wilhelm Ackermann. Instead, Ackermann found that the $z$-fold\nexponentiation of $x$ with $y$ was an example of a recursive function\nwhich was not primitive recursive. Later this was simplified by Rosza\nPeter to a function of two variables, similar to the one given above.",
