  "definition": "Fuzzy set theory is based on the idea that vague notions as \u201cbig\u201d,\n\u201cnear\u201d, \u201chold\u201d can be modelled by \u201cfuzzy subsets\u201d. The idea of a fuzzy\nsubset $T$ of a set $S$ is the following: each element $x\\in S$, there\nis a number $p\\in [0,1]$ such that $p_x$ is the \u201cprobability\u201d that $x$\nis in $T$.\n\nTo formally define a fuzzy set, let us first recall a well-known fact\nabout subsets: a subset $T$ of a set $S$ corresponds uniquely to the\ncharacteristic function $c_T:S\\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, such that\n$c_T(x)=1$ iff $x\\in T$. So if one were to replace $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$\nwith the the closed unit interval $[0,1]$, one obtains a fuzzy subset:\n\n> A *fuzzy subset* of a set $S$ is a map $s:S\\rightarrow [0,1]$ from $S$\n> into the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nMore precisely, the interval $[0,1]$ is considered as a complete lattice\nwith an involution $1-x$. We call *fuzzy subset of* $S$ any element of\nthe direct power $[0,1]^S$. Whereas there are $2^{|S|}$ subsets of $S$,\nthere are $\\aleph_1^{|S|}$ fuzzy subsets of $S$.\n\nThe join and meet operations in the complete lattice $[0,1]^S$ are named\n*union* and *intersection*, respectively. The operation induced by the\ninvolution is called *complement*. This means that if $s$ and $t$ are\ntwo fuzzy subsets, then the fuzzy subsets $s\\cup t, s\\cap t, -s$, are\ndefined by the equations\n$$(s\\cup t)(x) = \\max\\{s(x), t(x)\\} \\,\\,\\, ; \\,\\,\\,(s\\cap t)(x) = \\min\\{s(x), t(x)\\} \\,\\,\\, ; \\,\\,\\,-s(x) = 1-s(x).$$\nIt is also possible to consider any lattice $L$ instead of $[0,1]$. In\nsuch a case we call $L$*-subset of* $S$ any element of the direct power\n$L^S$ and the union and the intersection are defined by setting\n$$(s\\cup t)(x) = s(x)\\vee t(x) \\,\\,\\, ; \\,\\,\\,(s\\cap t)(x) = s(x)\\wedge t(x)$$\nwhere $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ denote the join and the meet operations in\n$L$, respectively. In the case an order reversing function\n$\\neg : L \\rightarrow L$ is defined in $L$, the *complement* $-s$ of $s$\nis defined by setting $$-s(x) = \\neg s(x).$$ Fuzzy set theory is devoted\nmainly to applications. The main success is perhaps *fuzzy control*.\n\n[9]{} Cignoli R., D Ottaviano I. M. L. and Mundici D.,[*Algebraic\nFoundations of Many-Valued Reasoning*]{}.
