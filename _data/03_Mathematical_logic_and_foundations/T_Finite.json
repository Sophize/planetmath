  "definition": "A set $S$ is *finite* if there exists a natural number $n$ and a\nbijection from $S$ to $n$. Note that we are using the set theoretic\ndefinition of natural number, under which the natural number $n$ equals\nthe set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$. If there exists such an $n$, then it is\nunique, and we call $n$ the *cardinality* of $S$.\n\nEquivalently, a set $S$ is finite if and only if there is no bijection\nbetween $S$ and any proper subset of $S$.",
