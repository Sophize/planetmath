  "statement": "Call a set $\\Delta$ of wff\u2019s of (classical) propositional logic *sound*\nif there is an interpretation (or valuation) $v$ such that $v(A)=1$ for\nevery $A\\in \\Delta$.\n\n(Compactness Theorem) $\\Delta$ is sound iff every finite subset of it is\nsound.\n\nOne direction is trivial. The converse is trivial too if $\\Delta$ is\nfinite. We now prove that if every finite subset of an infinite set\n$\\Delta$ is sound, so is $\\Delta$. There are two well-known proofs of\nthis, one assumes that the set $V$ of propositional variables is\ncountable, and the other does not. The one that does uses Konig\u2019s lemma,\nand the other one uses Tychonoff\u2019s theorem (hence the name compactness\ntheorem).\n\n*Proof using Konig\u2019s lemma*. Let $A_1,\\ldots$ be an enumeration of all\nthe wff\u2019s in $\\Delta$ (this assumes that the set $V$ of all\npropositional variables is countable). Let $i_1 \\le \\ldots$ be positive\nintegers such that $p_1, \\ldots, p_{i_n}$ are the propositional\nvariables that occur in wff\u2019s $A_1,\\ldots, A_n$. Since\n$\\lbrace A_1,\\ldots, A_n\\rbrace$ is sound, the set\n$S_n:=\\lbrace v\\in 2^V \\mid v(A_j)=1, j=1,\\ldots,n \\rbrace \\ne \\varnothing$\nfor each $n$. Furthermore, $S_{n+1} \\subseteq S_n$. Let\n$U_n:=\\lbrace v(p_1)\\cdots v(p_n)\\mid v\\in S_n \\rbrace$. In other words,\neach $U_n$ is a set of words over $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ of length $n$.\nThen $U_n$ is finite and non-empty (because $S_n \\ne \\varnothing$) for\neach $n$. Since $\\varnothing \\ne S_{n+1}\\subseteq S_n$, there is a word\nin $U_n$ that is a prefix of a word in $U_{n+1}$ for each $n$.\n\nLet $T$ be the tree with root $r$ (some arbitrary symbol) such that\n\n1.  its vertices other than $r$ are elements of\n    $U_1,\\ldots, U_n, \\ldots$.\n\n2.  the children of $r$ are elements of $U_1$,\n\n3.  if $\\ell \\in U_n$ is a vertex, then its children are elements of\n    $U_{n+1}$ with prefix $\\ell$\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see that $T$ is finitely branching, since each $U_n$ is\nfinite. Furthermore, by induction, if $\\ell \\in U_{n+1}$, then its\nprefix of length $n$, an element of $U_n$, is a vertex $\\ell'$ of $T$.\nSo $\\ell$, as a child of $\\ell'$, is a vertex $T$. Since each\n$U_n \\ne \\varnothing$ for each $n$, the $T$ has infinitely many\nvertices. As a result, we apply Konig\u2019s lemma, so that $T$ has an\ninfinite branch $T'$. It is easy to see that $T'$ corresponds to an\ninfinite word $\\alpha$ over $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, which in turn\ncorresponds to an interpretation $v$ such that $v(p_i)$ is the $i$\u2019th\nletter in $\\alpha$. It is now clear that $v(A_i)=1$ for each\n$A_i\\in \\Delta$, hence $\\Delta$ is sound. $\\square$\n\n*Proof using Tychonoff\u2019s theorem*. For any set $\\Delta$ of wff\u2019s, define\n$S(\\Delta):=\\lbrace v\\in 2^V \\mid v(A)=1, \\mbox{ for all } A \\in \\Delta \\rbrace$.\nIt is easy to see that\n$$S(\\bigcup \\lbrace \\Delta_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace) = \\bigcap \\lbrace S(\\Delta_i) \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$$\nfor $v$ is in the former set iff $v(A)=1$ for all\n$A\\in \\bigcup \\lbrace \\Delta_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ iff $v(A_i)=1$ for\nall $A_i\\in \\Delta_i$, $i\\in I$, iff $v$ in the later set.\n\nNext, equip $2:=\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ with the discrete topology, and\n$2^V$ the product topology. Since $2$ is compact, so is $2^V$ by the\nTychonoff\u2019s theorem, and therefore the finite intersection property\napplies. In addition, for any wff $A$, $S(\\lbrace A\\rbrace)$ is closed\nin $2^V$, since there are only a finite number of propositional\nvariables occurring in $A$. As a result, by equation $(1)$, $S(\\Delta)$\nis closed for any set $\\Delta$ of wff\u2019s.\n\nNow, suppose every finite subset of $\\Delta$ is sound. In particular,\nevery singleton subset of $\\Delta$ is sound. This means that for each\n$A\\in \\Delta$, $S(\\lbrace A\\rbrace)\\ne \\varnothing$. Let\n$\\mathfrak{D}:=\\lbrace S(\\lbrace A\\rbrace) \\mid A \\in \\Delta)$. Then\nevery member of $\\mathfrak{D}$ is closed, and, by assumption and\nequation $(1)$, the intersection of any finite family of members of\n$\\mathfrak{D}$ is non-empty, which means that\n$\\bigcap \\mathfrak{D} \\ne \\varnothing$. But\n$\\bigcap \\mathfrak{D} = S(\\Delta)$ by equation $(1)$, the result\nfollows. $\\square$\n\n**Remark**. It can be shown that the general version of the compactness\ntheorem is equivalent to the prime ideal theorem in Boolean algebra.\n\nBy the compactness theorem, one can show that soundness and consistency\nare the semantical and syntactical sides of the same idea.\n\nSoundness and consistency are the same on finite sets.\n\nIf $A_1,\\ldots,A_n\\vdash \\perp$, then $\\vdash B$, where $B$ is\n$A_1 \\to (A_2 \\to (\\cdots \\to (A_n \\to \\perp) \\cdots )$, or $v(B)=1$ for\nall $v$, or $v(A_1)=0$ or\n$v(A_2 \\to (\\cdots \\to (A_n \\to \\perp ) \\cdots)) = 1$, or $v(A_1)=0$ or\n$v(A_2)=0$ or $\\cdots$ or $v(A_n)=0$ for all $v$, by induction, or\n$v(A_i)=0$ for some $i$, where $i=1,\\ldots, n$, which means\n$\\lbrace A_1, \\ldots, A_n \\rbrace$ is not sound.\n\nConversely, if $\\lbrace A_1, \\ldots, A_n \\rbrace$ is not sound, then\n$v(A_i)=0$ for some $i$, where $i=1,\\ldots, n$ for all $v$. Renumber if\nnecessary, so that the indices $1$ and $i$ are switched, and $v(A_1)=0$\nfor all $v$. Let $B$ be the formula\n$A_2 \\to (\\cdots \\to (A_n \\to \\perp)\\cdots)$ Then $v(A_1\\to B)=1$ for\nall $v$. By the completeness theorem, $\\vdash A_1 \\to B$, and therefore\n$A_1,\\ldots, A_n\\vdash \\perp$ by the deduction theorem $n$ times.\n\nSoundness and consistency are the same on all sets.\n\nFor one direction, see . Now, suppose $\\Delta$ is consistent. Then every\nfinite subset of it is consistent, and therefore sound by the last\nproposition, hence $\\Delta$ itself is sound by the compactness theorem.\n\nA set $\\Delta$ of wff\u2019s is *uniquely sound* if there is a unique\ninterpretation $v$ such that $v(A)=1$ for every $A \\in \\Delta$.\n\nA set is maximally consistent iff it is a uniquely sound theory.\n\nIf $\\Delta$ is maximally consistent, then it is a theory (see ), and\nsound by the last corollary. Suppose $v_1(A)=v_2(A)=1$ for all\n$A\\in\\Delta$. If $v_1\\ne v_2$, then there is some wff $B\\notin \\Delta$\nsuch that $v_1(B)\\ne v_2(B)$. So one of them is $1$, say $v_1(B)=1$.\nThen $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace B\\rbrace$ is sound, and therefore consistent by\nthe last corollary, contradicting the maximality of $\\Delta$.\n\nWe actually proved more: any maximally consistent $\\Delta$ is\n$\\lbrace A \\mid v(A)=1 \\rbrace$, where $v$ is the unique interpretation\nsuch that $v(A)=1$ for all $A\\in \\Delta$. One direction is obvious. The\nother direction comes from the fact that $\\lbrace A \\mid v(A)=1 \\rbrace$\nis consistent and $\\Delta$ is maximal.\n\nConversely, suppose a theory $\\Delta$ is uniquely sound. Then\n$\\Delta=\\mbox{Ded}(\\Delta)=\\bigcap \\lbrace \\Gamma \\in W_L \\mid \\Delta\\subseteq \\Gamma\\rbrace$,\nwhere $W_L$ is the set of all maximally consistent sets of the logic\n$L$. Suppose $\\lbrace \\Gamma \\in W_L \\mid \\Delta\\subseteq \\Gamma\\rbrace$\nhas at least two elements, say, $\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2$. Then by the last\nparagraph, they are both uniquely sound. Let $v_1,v_2$ be the two\nrespective unique interpretations such that $v_i(A)=1$ for every\n$A\\in \\Gamma_i$, $i=1,2$. Since $\\Gamma_1\\ne \\Gamma_2$, there is a wff\n$B\\in \\Gamma_1 -\\Gamma_2$ such that $v_1(B)=1$ and $v_2(B)=0$. In\naddition, $v_1(A)=v_2(A)=1$ for all $A\\in \\Delta$, which forces\n$v_1=v_2$ because $\\Delta$ is uniquely sound. But this contradicts the\ninequality $v_2(B)\\ne v_2(B)$. Therefore,\n$\\lbrace \\Gamma \\in W_L \\mid \\Delta\\subseteq \\Gamma\\rbrace$ has exactly\none element, which is $\\Delta$.\n\n**Remark**. It is easy to see that\n$\\Delta_v:=\\lbrace A\\mid v(A)=1\\rbrace$ is maximally consistent for any\ninterpretation $v$: it is sound, and therefore consistent; it is\nmaximal, for given any wff $B$, either $v(B)=1$ or $v(B)=0$, so that\neither $B\\in \\Delta_v$ or $\\neg B\\in \\Delta_v$. Coupled with the\ncorollary above, there is a one-to-one correspondence\n$v\\mapsto \\Delta_v$ between interpretations and maximally consistent\nsets of a logic.",
