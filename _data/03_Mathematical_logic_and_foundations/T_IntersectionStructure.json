  "definition": "### Intersection structures {#intersection-structures .unnumbered}\n\nAn *intersection structure* is a set $C$ such that\n\n1.  $C$ is a subset of the powerset $P(A)$ of some set $A$, and\n\n2.  intersection of a non-empty family $\\mathcal{F}$ of elements of $C$\n    is again in $C$.\n\nIf order $C$ by set inclusion, then $C$ becomes a poset.\n\nThere are numerous examples of intersection structures. In algebra, the\nset of all subgroups of a group, the set of all ideals of a ring, and\nthe set of all subspaces of a vector space. In topology, the set of all\nclosed sets of a topological space is an intersection structure.\nFinally, in functional analysis, the set of all convex subsets of a\ntopological vector space is also an intersection structure.\n\nThe set of all partial orderings on a set is also an intersection\nstructure. A final example can be found in domain theory: let $C$ be the\nset of all partial functions from a non-empty set $X$ to a non-empty set\n$Y$. Since each partial function is a subset of $X\\times Y$, $C$ is a\nsubset of $P(X\\times Y)$. Let\n$\\mathcal{F}:=\\lbrace f_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be an arbitrary collection\nof partial functions in $C$ and $f=\\bigcap \\mathcal{F}$. $f$ is clearly\na relation between $X$ and $Y$. Suppose $x$ is in the domain of $f$. Let\n$E=\\lbrace y\\in Y\\mid xfy\\rbrace$. Then $xf_i y$ for each $f_i$ where\n$x$ is in the domain of $f_i$. Since $f_i$ is a partial function,\n$y=f_i(x)$, so that $y$ is uniquely determined. This means that $E$ is a\nsingleton, hence $f$ is a partial function, so that\n$\\bigcap \\mathcal{F}\\in C$, meaning that $C$ is an intersection\nstructure.\n\nThe main difference between the last two examples and the previous\nexamples is that in the last two examples, $C$ is rarely a complete\nlattice. For example, let $\\le$ be a partial ordering on a set $P$. Then\nits dual $\\le^{\\partial}$ is also a partial ordering on $P$. But the\njoin of $\\le$ and $\\le^{\\partial}$ does not exist. Here is another\nexample: let $X=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ and $Y=\\lbrace 2,3\\rbrace$. Then\n$C=\\lbrace \\varnothing, (1,2),(1,3)\\rbrace$. $(1,2)$ and $(1,3)$ are the\nmaximal elements of $C$, but the join of these two elements does not\nexist.\n\n### Topped intersection strucutres {#topped-intersection-strucutres .unnumbered}\n\nIf, in condition 2 above, we remove the requirement that $\\mathcal{F}$\nbe non-empty, then we have an intersection structure called a *topped\nintersection structure*.\n\nThe reason for calling them topped is because the top element of such an\nintersection structure always exists; it is the intersection of the\nempty family. In addition, a topped intersection structure is always a\ncomplete lattice. For a proof of this fact, see this .\n\nAs a result, for example, to show that the subgroups of a group form a\ncomplete lattice, it is enough to observe that arbitrary intersection of\nsubgroups is again a subgroup.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   A topped intersection structure is also called a *closure system*.\n    The reason for calling this is that every topped intersection\n    structure $C\\subseteq P(X)$ induces a closure operator\n    $\\operatorname{cl}$ on $P(X)$, making $X$ a closure space.\n    $\\operatorname{cl}:P(X)\\to P(X)$ given by\n    $$\\operatorname{cl}(A)=\\bigcap \\lbrace B\\in C\\mid A\\subseteq B\\rbrace$$\n    is well-defined.\n\n-   Conversely, it is not hard to see that every closure space\n    $(X,\\operatorname{cl})$ gives rise to a closure system\n    $C:=\\lbrace \\operatorname{cl}(A)\\mid A\\in P(X)\\rbrace$.\n\n-   An intersection structure $C$ is said to be *algebraic* if for every\n    directed set $B\\subseteq C$, we have that $\\bigcup B\\in C$. All of\n    the examples above, except the set of closed sets in a topological\n    space, are algebraic intersection structures. A topped intersection\n    structure that is algebraic is called an *algebraic closure system*\n    if,\n\n-   Every algebraic closure system is an algebraic lattice.\n\n[6]{} B. A. Davey, H. A.
