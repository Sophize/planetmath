  "definition": "A set $S$ is said to be *Diophantine* if\n\n-   it is a subset of $\\mathbb{N}^n$, the set of all $n$-tuples of\n    positive integers, and\n\n-   there is a polynomial $p$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $n+k$ variables,\n    $k\\ge 0$, such that $x\\in S$ iff there is some $y\\in \\mathbb{N}^k$,\n    such that $p(x,y)=0$.\n\nSo $S$ can be thought of as a set such that, there is a Diophantine\nequation $p=0$ and a non-negative integer $k$, so that when each element\nin $S$ is \u201ccombined\u201d with some $k$-tuple, makes up a solution to a\nDiophantine equation $p=0$. In other words, if\n$f_n^{n+k}:\\mathbb{N}^{n+k}\\to \\mathbb{N}^n$ is a projection function\ngiven by $f_n^{n+k}(x,y)=x$ where $x\\in \\mathbb{N}^n$ and\n$y\\in \\mathbb{N}^k$, then $S$ is a Diophantine set iff $S=f_n^{n+k}(Z)$,\nwhere $Z$ is the zero set of some Diophantine equation $p=0$.\nEquivalently, a set $S\\in \\mathbb{N}^n$ is Diophantine if there is a\n$p\\in \\mathbb{Z}[X_1,\\ldots , X_{n+k}]$, such that\n$$S=\\lbrace x\\in \\mathbb{N}^n\\mid \\exists y\\in \\mathbb{N}^k \\; p(x,y)=0\\rbrace.$$\n\nFor example, $\\mathbb{N}$ itself is Diophantine, for the polynomial\n$p(x,y)=x-y$ works. Another trivial example: the set of all positive\nintegers divisible by $3$ is Diophantine, for the polynomial\n$p(x,y)=x-3y$ works.\n\nFor a less trivial example, let us show that the set of all triples\n$(a,b,c)$ such that $a\\le b\\le c$ is Diophantine. For the inequality\n$a\\le b$, let $p(x_1,x_2,y)= x_2-x_1-(y-1)$. Then the sentence\n$\\exists y \\; p(x_1,x_2,y)=0$ is equivalent to $x_1\\le x_2$. Similarly,\nfor the inequality $b\\le c$, we have the same polynomial $p$. Putting\nthe two inequality together amounts to setting\n$q(x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2)=p(x_1,x_2,y_1)^2+p(x_2,x_3,y_2)^2$. Thus, the\nsentence $\\exists  (y_1,y_2)\\; q(x,y)=0$, where $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and\n$y=(y_1,y_2)$ is the same as the inequality $x_1\\le x_2\\le x_3$.\n\nSome other Diophantine sets are:\n\n-   the set $A=B\\cup C$, where $B$ and $C$ are Diophantine\n\n-   the set $A=B\\cap C$, where $B$ and $C$ are Diophantine\n\n-   the set $\\lbrace a \\mid a \\equiv b \\pmod n\\rbrace$\n\n-   the set of composite numbers\n\n-   the set of prime numbers\n\n-   the set of powers of a positive integer\n    $\\lbrace m^n\\mid n=0,1,\\ldots \\rbrace$\n\n**Remark**. Associated with the concept of a Diophantine set is that of\na *Diophantine function*: a function $f$ is said to be *Diophantine* if\nits graph $\\lbrace (x,f(x)) \\mid x\\in \\operatorname{dom}(f)\\rbrace$ is a\nDiophantine set. Some well-know Diophantine functions are the\nexponential functions $f(x)=n^x$ and the factorial function $f(x)=x!$,\nwhere $n,x$ are positive integers.\n\nIt turns out that a function is Diophantine iff it is recursive. From\nthis, it is possible to prove that Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem is unsolvable.\n\nThe idea behind using Diophantine sets to prove the unsolvability of\nHilbert\u2019s 10th problem comes from Yuri Matiyasevi\u0109, and hence the\ntheorem is known as Matiyasevi\u0109\u2019s theorem.\n\n[8]{} M Davis, [*Computability and Unsolvability*]{}.
