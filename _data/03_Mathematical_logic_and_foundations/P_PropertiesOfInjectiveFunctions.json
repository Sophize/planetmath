  "statement": "Suppose $A,B,C$ are sets and $f\\colon A\\to B$, $g\\colon B\\to C$ are\ninjective functions. Then the composition $g\\circ f$ is an injection.\n\nSuppose that $(g \\circ f) (x) = (g \\circ f) (y)$ for some $x, y \\in A$.\nBy definition of composition, $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$. Since $g$, is assumed\ninjective, $f(x) = f(y)$. Since $f$ is also assumed injective, $x = y$.\nTherefore, $(g \\circ f) (x) = (g \\circ f) (y)$ implies $x=y$, so\n$g \\circ f$ is injective.\n\nSuppose $f\\colon A\\to B$ is an injection, and $C\\subseteq A$. Then the\nrestriction $f|_C \\colon C\\to B$ is an injection.\n\nSuppose $(f|_C) (x) = (f|_C) (y)$ for some $x,y \\in C$. By definition of\nrestriction, $f(x) = f(y)$. Since $f$ is assumed injective this, in\nturn, implies that $x = y$. Thus, $f|_C$ is also injective.\n\nSuppose $A,B,C$ are sets and that the functions $f\\colon A\\to B$ and\n$g\\colon B\\to C$ are such that $g \\circ f$ is injective. Then $f$ is\ninjective.\n\n([*direct proof*]{}) Let $x, y \\in A$ be such that $f(x) = f(y)$. Then\n$g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$. But as $g \\circ f$ is injective, this implies that\n$x = y$, hence $f$ is also injective.\n\n([*proof by contradiction*]{}) Suppose that $f$ were not injective. Then\nthere would exist $x,y \\in A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$ but $x \\neq y$.\nComposing with $g$, we would then have $g(f(x)) = g(f(y))$. However,\nsince $g \\circ f$ is assumed injective, this would imply that $x = y$,\nwhich contradicts a previous statement. Hence $f$ must be injective.\n\nSuppose $f\\colon A\\to B$ is an injection. Then, for all $C\\subseteq A$,\nit is the case that $f^{-1} (f (C)) = C$.[^1]\n\nIt follows from the definition of $f^{-1}$ that $C \\subseteq f^{-1}  \n(f (C))$, whether or not $f$ happens to be injective. Hence, all that\nneed to be shown is that $f^{-1} (f (C)) \\subseteq C$. Assume the\ncontrary. Then there would exist $x \\in f^{-1} (f (C))$ such that\n$x \\notin C$. By defintion, $x \\in f^{-1} (f (C))$ means $f(x) \\in \nf(C)$, so there exists $y \\in A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. Since $f$ is\ninjective, one would have $x = y$, which is impossible because $y$ is\nsupposed to belong to $C$ but $x$ is not supposed to belong to $C$.\n\nSuppose $f\\colon A\\to B$ is an injection. Then, for all\n$C, D\\subseteq A$, it is the case that $f(C \\cap D) = f(C) \\cap f(D)$.\n\nWhether or not $f$ is injective, one has $f(C \\cap D) \\subseteq f(C) \n\\cap f(D)$; if $x$ belongs to both $C$ and $D$, then $f(x)$ will clearly\nbelong to both $f(C)$ and $f(D)$. Hence, all that needs to be shown is\nthat $f(C) \\cap f(D) \\subseteq f(C \\cap D)$. Let $x$ be an element of\n$B$ which belongs to both $f(C)$ and $f(D)$. Then, there exists\n$y \\in C$ such that $f(y) = x$ and $z \\in D$ such that $f(z) = x$. Since\n$f(y) = \nf(z)$ and $f$ is injective, $y = z$, so $y \\in C \\cap D$, hence $x \\in\nf(C \\cap D)$.\n\n[^1]: In this equation, the symbols \u201c$f$\u201d and \u201c$f^{-1}$\u201d as applied to\n    sets denote the direct image and the inverse image, respectively",
