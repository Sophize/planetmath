  "definition": "Given two labelled state transition systems (LTS)\n$M=(S_1,\\Sigma, \\rightarrow_1)$, $N=(S_2,\\Sigma, \\rightarrow_2)$, a\nbinary relation $\\approx \\subseteq S_1\\times S_2$ is called a\n*simulation* if whenever $p \\approx q$ and\n$p \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_1 p'$, then there is a $q'$ such that\n$p'\\approx q'$ and $q\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_2 q'$. An LSTS\n$M=(S_1,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_1)$ is *similar* to an LTS\n$N=(S_2,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_2)$ if there is a simulation\n$\\approx S_1\\times S_2$.\n\nFor example, any LTS is similar to itself, as the identity relation on\nthe set of states is a simulation. In addition,\n\n1.  if $M$ is similar to $N$ and $N$ is similar to $P$, then $M$ is\n    similar to $P$:\n\n    Let $M=(S_1,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_1)$, $N=(S_2,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_2)$,\n    and $P=(S_3,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_3)$ be LSTS, and suppose\n    $p \\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2 q$ with\n    $p \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_1 p'$, where $\\approx_1$ and\n    $\\approx_2$ are simulations. Then there is an $r $ such that\n    $p \\approx_1 r$ and $r\\approx_2 q$. Since $\\approx_1$ is a\n    simulation, there is an $r'$ such that\n    $r \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_2 r'$. But then since $\\approx_2$\n    is a simulation, there is a $q'$ such that\n    $q \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_3 q'$. As a result,\n    $\\approx_1\\circ \\approx_2$ is a simulation.\n\n2.  a union of simulations is a simulation.\n\n    Let $\\approx$ be the union of simulations $\\approx_i$, where\n    $i\\in I$, and suppose $p\\approx q$, with\n    $p \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} p'$. Then $p\\approx_i q$ for some\n    $i$. Since $\\approx_i$ is a simulation, there is a state $q'$ such\n    that $p' \\approx_i q'$ and $q\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} q'$. So\n    $p' \\approx q'$ and therefore $\\approx$ is a simulation.\n\nA binary relation $\\approx$ between $S_1$ and $S_2$ is a *bisimulation*\nif both $\\approx$ and its converse $\\approx^{-1}$ are simulations. A\nbisimulation is also called a *strong bisimulation*, in contrast with\n*weak bisimulation*. When there is a bisimulation between the state sets\nof two LTS, we say that the two systems are *bisimilar*, or *strongly\nbisimilar*. By abuse of notation, we write $M\\approx N$ to denote that\n$M$ is bisimilar to $N$.\n\nAn equivalent formulation of bisimulation is given by extending the\nbinary relation on the sets to a binary relation on the corresponding\npower sets. Here\u2019s how: let $\\approx \\subseteq S_1\\times S_2$. For any\n$A\\subseteq S_1$ and $B\\subseteq S_2$, define\n$$C(A):=\\lbrace b\\in S_2 \\mid a \\approx b \\mbox{ for some } a\\in A\\rbrace \\mbox{ and } C(B):=\\lbrace a\\in S_1 \\mid a \\approx b \\mbox{ for some } b\\in B\\rbrace.$$\nThen the binary relation $\\approx$ can be extended to a binary relation\nfrom $P(S_1)$ to $P(S_2)$, still denoted by $\\approx$, as\n$$A\\approx B \\quad \\textrm{iff} \\quad A\\subseteq C(B)\\textrm{ and }B\\subseteq C(A),$$\nfor any $A\\subseteq S_1$ and $B\\subseteq S_2$. In other words,\n$A\\approx B$ iff for any $a\\in A$, there is a $b\\in B$ such that\n$a\\approx b$ and for any $b\\in B$, there is an $a\\in A$ such that\n$a\\approx b$. Now, for any $p\\in S_1$ and $\\alpha \\in \\Sigma$, let\n$$\\delta_1(p,a)=\\lbrace q \\in S_1\\mid p\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow}_1 q\\rbrace.$$\nWe can similar define function $\\delta_2: S_2\\times \\Sigma \\to P(S_2)$.\nSo a binary relation $\\approx$ between $S_1$ and $S_2$ is a bisimilation\niff for any $(p,q)\\in S_1\\times S_2$ such that $p\\approx q$, we have\n$\\delta_1(p,a) \\approx \\delta_2(q,a)$ for any $a\\in \\Sigma$.\n\nLet $M=(S_1,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_1)$, $N=(S_2,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_2)$, and\n$P=(S_3,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow_3)$ be LTS. The following are some basic\nproperties of bisimulation:\n\n1.  The identity relation $=$ is a bisimilation on any LTS, since $=$ is\n    a simulation and $=^{-1}$ is just $=$.\n\n2.  If $M$ is bisimilar to $N$ via $\\approx$, then $N$ is bisimilar to\n    $M$ via $\\approx^{-1}$, since both $\\approx^{-1}$ and\n    $(\\approx^{-1})^{-1} = \\approx$ are simulations.\n\n3.  If $M\\approx_1$ and $N\\approx_2 P$, then\n    $M \\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2 P$, since $\\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2$\n    and\n    $(\\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2)^{-1} = \\approx_2^{1-}\\circ \\approx_1^{-1}$\n    are both simulations according to the argument above.\n\n4.  A union of bisimilations is a bisimilation.\n\n    Let $\\approx$ be the union of bisimulations $\\approx_i$, where\n    $i\\in I$. Then $\\approx$ is a simulation by the argument above. Now,\n    suppose $p \\approx^{-1} q$ and $p\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} p'$,\n    then $q\\approx p$. Then $q\\approx_i p$ for some $i \\in I$. So\n    $p \\approx_i^{-1} q$. Since $\\approx_i$ is a bisimulation, so is\n    $\\approx_i^{-1}$, and therefore for some state $q'$,\n    $p' \\approx_i^{-1} q'$ and $q \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} q'$.\n    This means that $p' \\approx^{-1} q'$, implying that $\\approx^{-1}$\n    is a simulation. Hence $\\approx$ is a bisimulation.\n\n5.  The union of all bisimilations on an LTS is a bisimulation that is\n    also an equivalence relation.\n\n    For an LTS $M$, let $\\approx_M$ be the union of all bisimulations on\n    $M$. Then $\\approx_M$ is a bisimulation by the previous result.\n    Since $=$ is a bisimulation on $M$, $\\approx_M$ is reflexive. If\n    $p \\approx_M q$, $p\\approx q$ for some bisimulation $\\approx$ on\n    $M$. Then $\\approx^{-1}$ is a bisimulation and therefore\n    $q\\approx^{-1} p$ implies that $q\\approx_M p$, so that $\\approx_M$\n    is symmetric. Finally, if $p \\approx_M q$ and $q\\approx_M r$, then\n    $p\\approx_1 q$ and $q\\approx_2 r$ for some bisimulations $\\approx_1$\n    and $\\approx_2$. So $\\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2$ is a bisimulation.\n    Since $p \\approx_1 \\circ \\approx_2 r$, $p \\approx_M r$ and therefore\n    $\\approx_M$ is transitive.\n\nFor an LTS $M=(S,\\Sigma,\\rightarrow)$, let $\\approx_M$ be the maximal\nbisimulation on $M$ as defined above. Since $\\approx_M$ is an\nequivalence relation, we can form an equivalence class $[p]$ for each\nstate $p\\in S$. Let $[S]$ be the set of all such equivalence classes:\n$[S]:=\\lbrace [p]\\mid p\\in S\\rbrace$. Define $[\\rightarrow]$ on\n$S\\times \\Sigma \\times S$ by\n$$[p] \\stackrel{\\alpha}{[\\rightarrow]} [q] \\qquad \\mbox{iff}  \\qquad p\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} q.$$\nThis is a well-defined ternary relation, for if $p\\approx_M p'$ and\n$q\\approx_M q'$, we have $p'\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} q'$. Now,\n$[M]:=([S],\\Sigma,[\\rightarrow])$ is an LSTS, and $M$ is bisimilar to\nit, with bisimulation given by the relation\n$\\lbrace (p,[p])\\mid p\\in S\\rbrace$.",
