  "definition": "The definition of identity types, with their induction principle, is due\nto Martin-L\u00f6f [@Martin-Lof-1972]. As mentioned in the notes to , our\nidentity types are those that belong to *intensional* type theory, by\ncontrast with those of *extensional* type theory which have an\nadditional \u201creflection rule\u201d saying that if $p:x=y$, then in fact\n$x{\\equiv}y$. This reflection rule implies that all the higher groupoid\nstructure collapses (see ), so for nontrivial homotopy we must use the\nintensional version. One may argue, however, that homotopy type theory\nis in another sense more \u201cextensional\u201d than traditional extensional type\ntheory, because of the function extensionality and univalence axioms.\n\nThe proofs of symmetry (inversion) and transitivity (concatenation) for\nequalities are well-known in type theory. The fact that these make each\ntype into a 1-groupoid (up to homotopy) was exploited\nin\u00a0[@hs:gpd-typethy] to give the first \u201chomotopy\u201d style semantics for\ntype theory.\n\nThe actual homotopical interpretation, with identity types as path\nspaces, and type families as fibrations, is due to [@AW], who used the\nformalism of Quillen model categories. An interpretation in (strict)\n$\\infty$-groupoids was also given in the thesis [@mw:thesis]. For a\nconstruction of *all* the higher operations and coherences of an\n$\\infty$-groupoid in type theory, see\u00a0[@pll:wkom-type]\nand\u00a0[@bg:type-wkom].\n\nOperations such as\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{transport}^{P}(p,{\\mathord{\\hspace{1pt}\\text{--}\\hspace{1pt}}})\\xspace}}$\nand $\\apfunc{f}$, and one good notion of equivalence, were first studied\nextensively in type theory by Voevodsky, using the proof assistant\n[<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Coq</span>]{}. Subsequently,\nmany other equivalent definitions of equivalence have been found, which\nare compared in .\n\nThe \u201ccomputational\u201d interpretation of identity types, transport, and so\non described in has been emphasized by\u00a0[@lh:canonicity]. They also\ndescribed a \u201c1-truncated\u201d type theory (see ) in which these rules are\njudgmental equalities. The possibility of extending this to the full\nuntruncated theory is a subject of current research.\n\nThe naive form of function extensionality which says that \u201cif two\nfunctions are pointwise equal, then they are equal\u201d is a common axiom in\ntype theory, going all the way back to [@PM2]. Some stronger forms of\nfunction extensionality were considered in\u00a0[@garner:depprod]. The\nversion we have used, which identifies the identity types of function\ntypes up to equivalence, was first studied by Voevodsky, who also proved\nthat it is implied by the naive version (and by univalence; see ).\n\nThe univalence axiom is also due to Voevodsky. It was originally\nmotivated by semantic considerations; see\u00a0[@klv:ssetmodel].\n\nIn the type theory we are using in this book, function extensionality\nand univalence have to be assumed as axioms, i.e.\u00a0elements asserted to\nbelong to some type but not constructed according to the rules for that\ntype. While serviceable, this has a few drawbacks. For instance, type\ntheory is formally better-behaved if we can base it entirely on rules\nrather than asserting axioms. It is also sometimes inconvenient that the\ntheorems of to are only propositional equalities (paths) or\nequivalences, since then we must explicitly mention whenever we pass\nback and forth across them. One direction of current research in\nhomotopy type theory is to describe a type system in which these rules\nare *judgmental* equalities, solving both of these problems at once. So\nfar this has only been done in some simple cases, although preliminary\nresults such as\u00a0[@lh:canonicity] are promising. There are also other\npotential ways to introduce univalence and function extensionality into\na type theory, such as having a sufficiently powerful notion of \u201chigher\nquotients\u201d or \u201chigher inductive-recursive types\u201d.\n\nThe simple conclusions in to such as\n\u201c${\\ensuremath{{\\mathsf{inl}}}\\xspace}$ and\n${\\ensuremath{{\\mathsf{inr}}}\\xspace}$ are injective and disjoint\u201d are\nwell-known in type theory, and the construction of the function\n[$\\mathsf{encode}$]{}is the usual way to prove them. The more refined\napproach we have described, which characterizes the entire identity type\nof a positive type (up to equivalence), is a more recent development;\nsee e.g.\u00a0[@ls:pi1s1].\n\nThe type-theoretic axiom of choice\u00a0 was noticed in William Howard\u2019s\noriginal paper\u00a0[@howard:pat] on the propositions-as-types\ncorrespondence, and was studied further by Martin-L\u00f6f with the\nintroduction of his dependent type theory. It is mentioned as a\n\u201cdistributivity law\u201d in Bourbaki\u2019s set theory [@Bourbaki]. For a more\ncomprehensive (and formalized) discussion of pullbacks and more general\nhomotopy limits in homotopy type theory, see\u00a0[@AKL13]. Limits of\ndiagrams over directed graphs are the easiest general sort of limit to\nformalize; the problem with diagrams over categories (or more generally\n$(\\infty,1)$-categories) is that in general, infinitely many coherence\nconditions are involved in the notion of (homotopy coherent) diagram.\nResolving this problem is an important open question in homotopy type\ntheory.\n\n[99]{}\n\n.
