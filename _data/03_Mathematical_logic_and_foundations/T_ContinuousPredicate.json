  "definition": "A **continuous predicate**, as described by Charles Sanders Peirce, is a\nspecial type of predicate that arises as the limit of an iterated\nprocess of hypostatic abstraction.\n\nThe following is an extended exposition of the concept in Peirce\u2019s own\nwords:\n\n> When we have analyzed a proposition so as to throw into the subject\n> everything that can be removed from the predicate, all that it remains\n> for the predicate to represent is the form of connection between the\n> different subjects as expressed in the propositional *form*. What I\n> mean by \u201ceverything that can be removed from the predicate\" is best\n> explained by giving an example of something not so removable.\\\n> But first take something removable. \u201cCain kills Abel.\" Here the\n> predicate appears as \u201c\u2014 kills \u2014.\" But we can remove killing from the\n> predicate and make the latter \u201c\u2014 stands in the relation \u2014 to \u2014.\"\n> Suppose we attempt to remove more from the predicate and put the last\n> into the form \u201c\u2014 exercises the function of relate of the relation \u2014 to\n> \u2014\" and then putting \u201cthe function of relate to the relation\" into\n> another subject leave as predicate \u201c\u2014 exercises \u2014 in respect to \u2014 to\n> \u2014.\" But this \u201cexercises\" expresses \u201cexercises the function\". Nay more,\n> it expresses \u201cexercises the function of relate\", so that we find that\n> though we may put this into a separate subject, it continues in the\n> predicate just the same.\\\n> Stating this in another form, to say that \u201c$A$ is in the relation $R$\n> to $B$\" is to say that $A$ is in a certain relation to $R$. Let us\n> separate this out thus: \u201c$A$ is in the relation $R^1$ (where $R^1$ is\n> the relation of a relate to the relation of which it is the relate) to\n> $R$ to $B$\". But $A$ is here said to be in a certain relation to the\n> relation $R^1$. So that we can express the same fact by saying, \u201c$A$\n> is in the relation $R^1$ to the relation $R^1$ to the relation $R$ to\n> $B$\", and so on *ad infinitum*.\\\n> A predicate which can thus be analyzed into parts all homogeneous with\n> the whole I call a *continuous predicate*. It is very important in\n> logical analysis, because a continuous predicate obviously cannot be a\n> *compound* except of continuous predicates, and thus when we have\n> carried analysis so far as to leave only a continuous predicate, we\n> have carried it to its ultimate elements.
