  "definition": "Introduction\n============\n\nA *set* is a collection, , or conglomerate[^1].\n\nSets can be of \u201c\u201d objects or mathematical objects, but the sets\nthemselves are purely conceptual. This is an important point to note:\nthe set of all cows (for example) does not physically exist, even though\nthe cows do. The set is a \u201cgathering\u201d of the cows into one conceptual\nthat is not part of physical reality. This makes it easy to see why we\ncan have sets with an infinite number of elements; even though we may\nnot be able to point out infinitely many objects in the real world, we\ncan construct conceptual sets which an infinite number of elements (see\nthe examples below).\n\nThe symbol $\\in$ denotes set *membership*. For example, $ s \\in S $\nwould be read \u201c$s$ is an element of $S$\u201d.\n\nWe write $A \\subset B$ if for all $x \\epsilon A$ we have $x \\epsilon B$\nand we then say $B$ *contains* $A$. We sometimes write \u201c$S$ *contains*\n$s$\u201d when $S$ contains the set whose only element is $s$. Mathematics is\nthus built upon sets of purely conceptual, or mathematical, objects.\nSets are usually denoted by upper-case roman letters (such as $S$). Sets\ncan be defined by listing the members, as in $$S := \\{ a, b, c, d\\}.$$\nOr, a set can be defined from a predicate (called \u201cset builder\nnotation\u201d). This type of statement defining a set is of the form\n$$S := \\{ x \\in X : P(x) \\},$$ where $S$ is the symbol denoting the set,\n$x$ is the variable we are introducing to represent a generic element of\nthe set (note that, by the so called axiom of comprehension (or axiom of\nsubsets), $x$ must be a member of some set which has already been\ndefined. This is necessary in order to avoid Russell\u2019s paradox[^2].) and\n$P(x)$ is some property which must be true for any element $x$ of the\nset (that is, $x\\in S$ is equivalent to $x\\in X$ and $P(x)$ holds.)\nSometimes, we write a set definition as $S := \\{ f(x) \\in X : P(x) \\}$,\nwhere $f(x)$ is a transformation of that variable. In this case, we can\nsimply replace the set $X$ by $Y$, where\n$Y := \\{ y \\in X : \\exists x\\in X, y = f(x) \\}$ in order to define the\nset as above.\n\nSets are, in fact, completely specified by their elements. If two sets\nhave the same elements, they are equal. This is called the axiom of\nextensionality, and it is one of the most important characteristics of\nsets that distinguishes them from predicates or properties.\n\nSome examples of sets are:\n\n-   The standard number sets ${\\mathbb{N}}$, ${\\mathbb{Z}}$,\n    ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, ${\\mathbb{R}}$ and ${\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\n-   The set of all even integers:\n    $\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z} : 2 {\\!\\mid\\!}x \\}.$\n\n-   The set of all prime numbers (sometimes denoted ${\\mathbb{P}}$):\n    $\\{ p \\in \\mathbb{N} : p > 1, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\;\\; x {\\!\\mid\\!}p \\Rightarrow x \\in \\{1 , p \\} \\}$,\n    where $\\Rightarrow$ denotes implies and $\\mid$ denotes divides.\n\n-   The set of all real functions of one real parameter (sometimes\n    denoted by ${\\mathbb{R}}^{\\mathbb{R}}$):\n    $\\{ f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R} : x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$ or, more formally,\n    $\\{f \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^2 : \\left[\\forall x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}, \\exists y\\in {\\mathbb{R}}, (x,y)\\in f\\right] \\wedge \\left[(x,y),(x,y')\\in f \\Rightarrow  y=y'\\right] \\}$.\n\n-   The unit circle ${\\mathbb{S}}^1$: $\\{z\\in {\\mathbb{C}}: |z| = 1\\}$,\n    where $|z|$ is the modulus of $z$.\n\nThe most basic set is the empty set (denoted $\\varnothing$, $\\emptyset$\nor $\\{\\}$).\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that all of our examples of sets\nutilize sets, which does not suffice for rigorous definition. We can be\nmore rigorous if we postulate only the empty set, and define a set in\ngeneral as anything which one can construct from the empty set and the\nZFC axioms. The non-negative integers, for instance, are defined by\n$0 := \\varnothing$ and the successor of $x$, $s(x) = x \\cup \\{x\\}.$ A\nnon-negative integer is thus the set of all its predecessors (for\nexample, we have\n$3 = \\{0,1,2\\} = \\{\\varnothing, \\{\\varnothing\\},\\{\\varnothing, \\{\\varnothing\\}\\}\\}$)[^3].\n\nAll objects in modern mathematics are constructed via sets. An important\npoint to be made about this is that the construction of the object is\nless important than the way it will *behave*. As an example, we usually\ndefine an ordered pair $(x,y)$ as the set $\\{x,\\{x,y\\}\\}$: what matters\nhere is that, for two ordered pairs $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$, we have\n$(x,y) = (x',y')$ if and only if $x = x'$ and $y = y'$, and this is true\nwith the given definition, as one can easily see. We could, however,\nalso have taken $\\{x,\\{x,\\{y\\}\\}\\}$ as the definition of $(x,y)$, in\nwhich case the needed property also holds and we have a valid definition\n(we chose the first only because it is simpler).\n\nSet Notions\n===========\n\nAn important set notion is *cardinality*. Cardinality is roughly the\nsame as the intuitive notion of \u201csize\u201d or number of elements. While this\nintuitive definition works well for finite sets, intuition breaks down\nfor sets with an infinite number of elements. The cardinality of a set\n$S$ is denoted $|S|$ (sometimes $\\# S$ or $\\operatorname{card}S$) and we\nsay that sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality if and only if there\nis a bijection from one to the other. For more detail, see the\ncardinality entry.\n\nAnother important set concept is that of *subsets*. A subset $B$ of a\nset $A$ is any set which contains only elements that appear in $A$.\nSubsets are denoted with the $\\subseteq$ symbol, i.e. $B \\subseteq A$\n(in which case $A$ is called a *superset* of B). Also useful is the\nnotion of a *proper subset*, denoted $B \\subsetneq A$ (or sometimes,\n$B \\subset A$)[^4], which adds the restriction that $B$ must also not be\nequal to $A$. The set of all subsets of a set $S$ is called *the power\nset of $S$*, denoted ${\\mathcal{P}}(S)$ (the existence of this set is\nalso axiomatic: it is guaranteed by the axiom of the power set). Note\nthat $B$ does not need to have a lower cardinality than $A$ to be a\nproper subset, i.e., $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dotsc\\}$ is a proper subset of\n$\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dotsc\\}$, but both have the same cardinality, $\\aleph_0$\n(In fact, a set is infinite if and only if it has the same cardinality\nas some proper subset).\n\nSet Operations\n==============\n\nThere are a number of standard (common) operations which are used to\nmanipulate sets, producing new sets from combinations of existing sets\n(sometimes with entirely different types of elements). These standard\noperations are:\n\n-   -   intersection\n\n-   set difference\n\n-   symmetric set difference\n\n-   complement\n\n-   Cartesian product\n\n-   \n\n[^1]: However, not every collection has to be a set (in fact, all\n    collections *can\u2019t* be sets: there is no set of all sets or of all\n    ordinals for example). See proper class for more details.\n\n[^2]: One needs to be careful when defining a set by a predicate only,\n    since (for example) \u201c$x$ is not in $x$\u201d is a perfectly good\n    predicate. Either one needs to restrict the kind of predicate, or,\n    more commonly, one needs to *define only subsets* by predicates. So\n    while one cannot do $\\{x \\colon x \\not\\in x\\}$, if one already has a\n    set $U$, one can do $\\{x: x \\in U, x \\not\\in x\\}$.\n\n[^3]: Note however that the existence of the *set* of non-negative\n    integers needs an additional axiom beside those which are required\n    to define its members: the axiom of infinity.\n\n[^4]: Beware \u2014 some authors use $\\subset$ to mean proper subset, while\n    most use it to mean subset with equality (the same as $\\subseteq$),\n    which can make the $B \\subset A$ notation ambiguous.",
