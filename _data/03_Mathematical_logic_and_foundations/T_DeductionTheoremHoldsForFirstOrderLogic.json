  "definition": "In this entry, we show that the deduction theorem holds for first order\nlogic. Actually, depending on the axiom systems, some modifications to\nthe deduction theorem may be necessary. If we use the system given in\nthe beginning of , no modifications are necessary, and the proof is\nmutatis mutandis the same as the one for propositional logic. However,\nif we instead use the system given in the remark of that entry, the\ndeduction theorem needs to be revised. For convenience, we briefly state\nthe axiom system here:\n\n1.  tautologies\n\n2.  $\\forall x A \\to A[a/x]$, where $x\\in V$, $a\\in V(\\Sigma)$, and $a$\n    is free for $x$ in $A$\n\n3.  $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (A \\to \\forall x B)$, where $x \\in V$ is not\n    free in $A$\n\nwith modus ponens and generalization as inference rules. A deduction of\na wff $A$ from a set $\\Delta$ is a finite sequence of wff\u2019s, where each\nwff is either an axiom, an element of $\\Delta$, or the result of an\napplication of an inference rule.\n\n(Modified Deduction Theorem). If $\\Delta, A \\vdash B$, then\n$\\Delta \\vdash A \\to B$, provided that there is a deduction\n$\\mathcal{E}$ of $B$ from $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$ that contains no\napplications of universal generalization\n\n-   either to a variable occurring free in $A$, or\n\n-   to a wff whose deduction in $\\mathcal{E}$ contains $A$ as a premise\n\nA big portion of the proof is the same as the one given for the\ndeduction theorem for propositional logic, namely, the cases that $B$ is\nan axiom, an element of $\\Delta$, or as the result of an application of\nmodus ponens. We will not repeat the proof here, but refer the reader to\nfor that. In this entry, we will concentrate on the proof of the last\ncase: when $B$ is the result of an application of universal\ngeneralization.\n\nLet us first rephrase the conditions in the theorem. We are given a\ndeduction $\\mathcal{E}$ of $B$ from $\\Delta \\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$, that\nis, sequence of wff\u2019s $$A_1,\\ldots, A_n$$ such that if $A_i$ is\n$\\forall x A_j$ (where $j<i$), then either\n\n-   the variable $x$ is not free in $A$, or\n\n-   the deduction of $A_j$ in the sequence $A_1,\\ldots, A_j$ does not\n    contain $A$\n\nAs mentioned, we assume that $B$ is $\\forall x A_k$, where $A_k$ is in\n$\\mathcal{E}$.\n\nWe induct on the length $n$ of $\\mathcal{E}$. By the assumption on $B$,\n$n$ is at least $2$. If $n=2$, then $\\mathcal{E}$ is\n$$A_1, \\forall x A_1.$$ Then $A_1$ is either an axiom, or an element of\n$\\Delta \\cup \\lbrace A\\rbrace$. Furthermore, $x$ does not occur free in\n$A_1$. If $A_1$ is either an axiom or in $\\Delta$, then\n$$A_1, \\forall x A_1, \\forall x A_1 \\to (A \\to \\forall x A_1), A \\to \\forall x A_1$$\nis a deduction of $A \\to B$ from $\\Delta$. If $A_1$ is $A$, then\n$$\\cdots, A\\to A , \\forall x (A\\to A), \\forall x(A\\to A) \\to (A\\to \\forall x A), A\\to \\forall xA$$\nis a deduction of $A\\to B$ from $\\Delta$, where $\\cdots, A\\to A$ is a\ndeduction of the tautology $A\\to A$ (see ).\n\nNow assume the length of $\\mathcal{E}$ is $n>2$. Furthermore, we may\nassume that it has the form $$A_1,\\ldots, A_{n-1}, \\forall x A_{n-1}$$\nfrom $\\Delta\\cup \\lbrace A \\rbrace$. Then none of $A_1,\\ldots, A_{n-1}$\ncontain $x$ free. Now, let us look at the conditions above:\n\n-   $x$ is not free in $A$. As $A_1,\\ldots, A_{n-1}$ is a deduction of\n    $A_{n-1}$ of length $n-1$, by induction, there is a deduction of\n    $$B_1,\\ldots,B_m$$ of $A\\to A_{n-1}$ from $\\Delta$. Since $x$ does\n    not occur free in $A$,\n    $$B_1,\\ldots,B_m, \\forall x (A\\to A_{n-1}), \\forall x (A\\to A_{n-1}) \\to (A \\to \\forall x A_{n-1}), A\\to \\forall x A_{n-1}$$\n    is a deduction of $A\\to \\forall x A_{n-1}$.\n\n-   the deduction of $A_j$ in the sequence $A_1,\\ldots, A_j$ does not\n    contain $A$. Let $$B_1,\\ldots, B_m$$ be this deduction of $A_j$ in\n    $\\mathcal{E}$. Then\n    $$B_1,\\ldots, B_m, \\forall x A_{n-1}, \\forall x A_{n-1} \\to (A \\to \\forall x A_{n-1}), A\\to \\forall x A_{n-1}$$\n    is a deduction of $A\\to \\forall x A_{n-1}$.\n\nIn both cases, since $A$ does not occur in the deduction,\n$\\Delta \\vdash A \\to B$.\n\nNote that the last three steps of deductions $(1)$ and $(4)$ use\ngeneralization, the axiom schema $A\\to (B\\to A)$, and modus ponens, and\nthe last steps of deductions $(2)$ and $(3)$ use generalization, the\naxiom schema $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (A \\to \\forall x B)$, and modus\nponens.\n\nAs a corollary, we have\n\nIf $\\Delta, A \\vdash B$, and $A$ a sentence, then\n$\\Delta \\vdash A \\to B$.\n\n**Remark**. If we want to restore the modified deduction theorem to its\noriginal version (Theorem 2 below), and we want keep the axiom system\nstated above, the way deductions are constructed needs to be modified.\nIn this case, the modification is: if $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ is a deduction of\n$A$, and $A$ is $\\forall x A_i$, the result of an application of\ngeneralization to an earlier wff $A_i$, then $x$ does not occur free in\nany of the wff\u2019s in the deduction. With this change, we have the\noriginal version:\n\n(Deduction Theorem). If $\\Delta, A \\vdash B$, then\n$\\Delta \\vdash A\\to B$.\n\nThis is an immediate consequence of the following fact: if $B$ can be\ndeduced with $A$ as a hypothesis, then $A\\to B$ can be deduced without\n$A$ as a hypothesis, which can be easily proved using induction.",
