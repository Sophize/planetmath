  "definition": "Let FO$(\\Sigma)$ be a first order language over signature $\\Sigma$.\nFurthermore, let $V$ be a countably infinite set of variables and\n$V(\\Sigma)$ the set extending $V$ to include the constants in $\\Sigma$.\nBefore describing the axiom system for FO$(\\Sigma)$, we need the\nfollowing definition:\n\n**Definition**. Let $A$ be a wff. A *generalization* of $A$ is a wff\nhaving the form $\\forall x_1 \\forall x_2 \\cdots \\forall x_n A$, for any\n$n\\ge 0$. Thus, $A$ is a generalization of itself.\n\nThe axiom system of FO$(\\Sigma)$ consists of any wff that is a\ngeneralization of a wff belonging to any one of the following six\nschemas:\n\n1.  $A\\to (B\\to A)$\n\n2.  $(A\\to (B\\to C)) \\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$\n\n3.  $\\neg \\neg A \\to A$\n\n4.  $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (\\forall x A \\to \\forall x B)$, where\n    $x\\in V$\n\n5.  $A\\to \\forall x A$, where $x\\in V$ is not free in $A$\n\n6.  $\\forall x A \\to A[a/x]$, where $x\\in V$, $a\\in V(\\Sigma)$, and $a$\n    is free for $x$ in $A$\n\nand modus ponens (from $A$ and $A\\to B$ we may infer $B$) as its only\nrule of inference.\n\nIn schema 6, the wff $A[a/x]$ is obtained by replacing all free\noccurrences of $x$ in $A$ by $a$.\n\nLogical symbols $\\land,\\lor$, and $\\exists$ are derived:\n$A\\lor B:=\\neg A\\to B$; $A\\land B:=\\neg (\\neg A\\lor \\neg B)$; and\n$\\exists x A:=\\neg \\forall x \\neg A$.\n\n**Remark**. Again, in schema 6, the reason why we want $a$ free for $x$\nin $A$ is to keep the \u201cintended meaning\u201d of $A$ intact. For example,\nsuppose $A$ is $\\forall y (x < y)$. Then $A[y/x]$ is\n$\\forall y (y < y)$. Obviously the two do not have the same \u201cintended\nmeaning\u201d. In fact, $A[y/x]$ is not valid in any model. Similarly, in the\nschema 5, we want $x$ not occur free in $A$ to maintain its \u201cintended\nmeaning\u201d. For example, if $A$ is the formula $x=0$, then $\\forall x A$\nis $\\forall x (x=0)$, which is not true in any model with at least two\nelements.\n\nThe concepts of deductions and theorems are exactly the same as those\nfound in propositional logic. Here is an example: if $\\vdash A$, then\n$\\vdash \\forall x A$. To see this, we induct on the length $n$ of the\ndeduction of $A$. If $n=1$, then $A$ is an axiom, and therefore so is\nits generalization $\\forall x A$, so that $\\vdash \\forall x A$. Suppose\nnow that the length is $n+1$. If $A$ is an axiom, we are back to the\nprevious argument. Otherwise, $A$ is obtained from earlier formulas $B$\nand $B\\to A$ via modus ponens. Since the deduction of $B$ and $B\\to A$\nare at most $n$, by induction, we have $\\vdash \\forall x B$ and\n$\\vdash \\forall x (B\\to A)$. Since\n$\\forall x (B\\to A) \\to (\\forall x B \\to \\forall x A)$ is an axiom, we\nhave $\\vdash \\forall x B \\to \\forall x A$ by modus ponens, and then\n$\\vdash \\forall x A$ by modus ponens again.\n\n**Remark**. Another popular axiom system for first order logic has 1, 2,\n3, 6 above as its axiom schemas, plus the following schema\n\n-   $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (A \\to \\forall x B)$, where $x \\in V$ is not\n    free in $A$\n\nand two rules of inferences: modus ponens, and *universal\ngeneralization*:\n\n-   from $A$ we may infer $\\forall x A$, where $x \\in V$\n\nNote the similarity between the rule of generalization and axiom schema\n5 above. However, the important difference is that $x$ is not permitted\nto be free in $A$ in the axiom schema.\n\nWith this change, the concept of deductions needs to be modified: we say\nthat a wff $A$ is *deducible* from a set $\\Gamma$ of wff\u2019s, if there is\na finite sequence $$A_1,\\ldots, A_n$$ where $A=A_n$, such that for each\n$i$, $i=1,\\ldots, n$\n\n1.  $A_i$ is either an axiom or in $\\Gamma$\n\n2.  $A_i$ is obtained by an application of modus ponens\n\n3.  $A_i$ is obtained by an application of generalization: $A_i$ is\n    $\\forall x A_j$ for some $j<i$.",
