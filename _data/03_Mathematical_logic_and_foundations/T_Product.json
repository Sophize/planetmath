  "definition": "The word [*product*]{} in mathematics generally means the result of some\nof [*multiplication*]{} operation, of certain of mapping\n$X\\!\\times\\!X \\rightarrow Y$; such operations are commonly distributive\nover the [*addition*]{} operation of $X$ if it is defined.\n\nIf $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two elements of the set $X$, giving the product\n$y\\in Y$, then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in general called the [*factors*]{}\nof this product.\\\nSome most usual products are\n\n-   the (also in fields), especially the product of numbers and the\n    product of square matrices;\n\n-   on vectors the scalar product, the vector product, the dyad product\n    and the Hadamard product; on ideals the product of ideals;\n\n-   the Cartesian product, the direct products of various systems (not\n    in with any additions).\\\n\nSuch kinds of product that are associative, allow to form a product of\nmore than two factors, which is justified by the theorem in the entry\ngeneral associativity. E.g. the usual product of the integers from 1 to\n$n$ is the factorial of $n$.",
