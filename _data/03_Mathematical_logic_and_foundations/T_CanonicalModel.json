  "definition": "Recall that a logic is a set of wff\u2019s containing all tautologies and\nclosed under modus ponens. Given a logic $\\Lambda$, a set $\\Delta$ of\nwff\u2019s is $\\Lambda$-consistent if $\\perp$ can not be deduced from\n$\\Delta$ given $\\Lambda$. $\\Lambda$ itself is said to be\n$\\Lambda$-consistent if $\\perp$ can not be deduced from the empty set.\nLet $\\Lambda$ be a consistent normal modal logic. The *canonical frame*\nfor $\\Lambda$ is the Kripke frame\n$\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}:=(W_{\\Lambda},R_{\\Lambda})$, where\n\n1.  $W_{\\Lambda}$ is the set of all maximally consistent sets, and\n\n2.  $w R_{\\Lambda} u$ iff $\\square A \\in w$ implies $A \\in u$ for any\n    wff $A$.\n\nIf we define $\\Delta_w:=\\lbrace B\\mid \\square B\\in w\\rbrace$, then the\nsecond condition above reads $w R_{\\Lambda} u$ iff\n$\\Delta_w \\subseteq u$.\n\nThe *canonical model* of $\\Lambda$ based on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ is\nthe pair $M_{\\Lambda}:=(\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}, V_{\\Lambda})$, where\n\n-   $V(p):=\\lbrace w \\in W_{\\Lambda} \\mid p \\in w \\rbrace$.\n\nThe main result regarding the canonical model of $\\Lambda$ is:\n\n$M_{\\Lambda} \\models A$ iff $\\Lambda \\vdash A$, where $A$ is any wff.\n\nSince the logic $\\Lambda$ is the intersection of all maximally\nconsistent sets (see ), the theorem is the result of the following:\n\n$M_{\\Lambda} \\models_w A$ iff $A \\in w$.\n\nwhich is the result of the following:\n\nFor any world $w$ in $M_{\\Lambda}$, $\\square A \\in w$ iff $A\\in u$ for\nall worlds $u$ such that $w R_{\\Lambda} u$.\n\nSuppose $\\square A \\in w$ and $w R_{\\Lambda} u$. Then $A \\in u$ by the\ndefinition of $R_{\\Lambda}$. Conversely, suppose $A \\in u$ for all $u$\nsuch that $w R_{\\Lambda} u$. In other words, $A\\in u$ for all $u$ such\nthat $\\Delta_w \\subseteq u$, or\n$A\\in \\bigcap \\lbrace u \\mid \\Delta_w \\subseteq u\\rbrace$. But\n$\\bigcap \\lbrace u \\mid \\Delta_w \\subseteq u\\rbrace = \\mbox{Ded}(\\Delta_w)$,\nthe deductive closure of $\\Delta_w$, so $\\Delta_w \\vdash A$, and\ntherefore $\\square \\Delta_w \\vdash \\square A$ (see ), or\n$w \\vdash \\square A$ (since $\\Delta_w \\subseteq w$), or\n$\\square A \\in w$ (since $w$ is maximally consistent).\n\n**Proof of Proposition 1**. We do induction on the number $n$ of logical\nconnectives in $A$. If $n=0$, then $A$ is either a propositional\nvariable or $\\perp$. The former is just the definition of $V_{\\Lambda}$.\nThe later case is just the definition of $\\Lambda$-consistency. Next, if\n$A$ is $B\\to C$, then $M_{\\Lambda} \\models_w A$ iff either\n$M_{\\Lambda} \\not \\models_w B$ or $M_{\\Lambda} \\models_w C$ iff\n$B \\notin w$ or $C \\in w$ iff $\\neg B \\in w$ or $C \\in w$ iff\n$\\neg B \\lor C \\in w$ iff $A \\in w$. Finally, if $A$ is $\\square B$,\nthen $M_{\\Lambda} \\models_w \\square B$ iff $\\square B \\in w$ iff\n$B\\in u$ for all $u$ such that $w R_{\\Lambda} u$ iff\n$M_{\\Lambda} \\models_u B$ for all $u$ such that $w R_{\\Lambda} u$.\n\nRecall that a logic is complete in a frame if it is complete in every\nmodel based on the frame. As a corollary to Theorem 1, we have\n\n$\\Lambda$ is complete in its canonical frame $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$.\n\nAny wff valid in every model based on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ is valid\nin $M_{\\Lambda}$ in particular, and therefore a theorem of $\\Lambda$ by\nTheorem 1.\n\nThe converse is not true. There are in fact normal modal logics that are\nsound in no frames at all.\n\nCanonical models are useful in proving the completeness theorems for\nmany common normal modal logics. To prove that a logic is complete in a\nclass of frames, by the corollary above, it is enough to show that the\ncanonical frame is in the class. Here are two examples:\n\n1.  Let $\\Lambda$ be the smallest normal logic containing the schema\n    $\\square A$. Then $\\Lambda$ is complete in the class of null frames.\n\n    By the discussion above, it is enough to show that\n    $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ is a null frame: the assumption\n    $\\exists w\\exists u (w R_{\\Lambda} u)$ leads to a contradiction.\n    Suppose $w R_{\\Lambda} u$. Then $\\Delta_w \\subseteq u$. This means\n    that if $\\square A \\in w$, then $A\\in u$. But $\\square A$ is a\n    theorem (in $\\Lambda$), $\\square A \\in w$ for any wff $A$. This\n    means that $A\\in u$ for any wff $A$, or that $u$ is inconsistent, a\n    contradiction.\n\n2.  Let $\\Lambda$ be the smallest normal logic containing the schema\n    $A\\to \\square A$. Then $\\Lambda$ is complete in the class of weak\n    identity frames (a binary relation $R$ is weak identity it is\n    satisfies the condition $\\forall x\\forall y (x R y \\to x=y)$).\n\n    Again, we show that $R_{\\Lambda}$ is weak identity. Suppose\n    $w R_{\\Lambda} u$. Then for any $A$, $\\square A \\in w$ implies that\n    $A\\in u$. Now, if $A\\in w$, then applying modus ponens to\n    $A\\to \\square A$, we get that $\\square A \\in w$ since $w$ is closed\n    under modus ponens. But this means that $A\\in u$. So $w\\subseteq u$.\n    But since both $w$ and $u$ are maximal, they are the same.",
