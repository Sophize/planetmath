  "definition": "Definitions {#definitions .unnumbered}\n===========\n\nLet $(P,\\leq)$ be a poset. A subset $A\\subseteq P$ is said to be\n*cofinal* in $P$ if for every $x\\in P$ there is a $y\\in A$ such that\n$x\\le y$. A function $f\\colon X\\to P$ is said to be *cofinal* if $f(X)$\nis cofinal in $P$. The least cardinality of a cofinal set of $P$ is\ncalled the *cofinality* of $P$. Equivalently, the cofinality of $P$ is\nthe least $\\alpha$ such that there is a cofinal function\n$f\\colon\\alpha\\to P$. The cofinality of $P$ is written $\\cf{P}$, or\n$\\cof{P}$.\n\nCofinality of totally ordered sets {#cofinality-of-totally-ordered-sets .unnumbered}\n==================================\n\nIf $(T,\\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, then it must contain a\nwell-ordered cofinal subset which is order-isomorphic to $\\cf{T}$. Or,\nput another way, there is a cofinal function $f\\colon\\cf{T}\\to T$ with\nthe property that $f(x)<f(y)$ whenever $x<y$.\n\nFor any ordinal $\\beta$ we must have $\\cf{\\beta}\\leq\\beta$, because the\nidentity map on $\\beta$ is cofinal. In particular, this is true for\ncardinals, so any cardinal $\\kappa$ either satisfies\n$\\cf{\\kappa}=\\kappa$, in which case it is said to be *regular*, or it\nsatisfies $\\cf{\\kappa}<\\kappa$, in which case it is said to be\n*singular*.\n\nThe cofinality of any totally ordered set is necessarily a regular\ncardinal.\n\nCofinality of cardinals {#cofinality-of-cardinals .unnumbered}\n=======================\n\n$0$ and $1$ are regular cardinals. All other finite cardinals have\ncofinality $1$ and are therefore singular.\n\nIt is easy to see that $\\cf{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_0$, so $\\aleph_0$ is\nregular.\n\n$\\aleph_1$ is regular, because the union of countably many countable\nsets is countable. More generally, all infinite successor cardinals are\nregular.\n\nThe smallest infinite singular cardinal is $\\aleph_{\\omega}$. In fact,\nthe function $f\\colon\\omega\\to\\aleph_{\\omega}$ given by $f(n)=\\omega_n$\nis cofinal, so $\\cf{\\aleph_\\omega}=\\aleph_0$. More generally, for any\nnonzero limit ordinal $\\delta$, the function\n$f\\colon\\delta\\to\\aleph_\\delta$ given by $f(\\alpha)=\\omega_\\alpha$ is\ncofinal, and this can be used to show that\n$\\cf{\\aleph_\\delta}=\\cf{\\delta}$.\n\nLet $\\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal. It can be shown that $\\cf{\\kappa}$\nis the least cardinal $\\mu$ such that $\\kappa$ is the sum of $\\mu$\ncardinals each of which is less than $\\kappa$. This fact together with\nK\u00f6nig\u2019s theorem tells us that $\\kappa<\\kappa^{\\cf{\\kappa}}$. Replacing\n$\\kappa$ by $2^\\kappa$ in this inequality we can further deduce that\n$\\kappa<\\cf{2^\\kappa}$. In particular, $\\cf{2^{\\aleph_0}}>\\aleph_0$,\nfrom which it follows that $2^{\\aleph_0}\\neq\\aleph_\\omega$ (this being\nthe smallest uncountable aleph which is provably not the cardinality of\nthe continuum).",
