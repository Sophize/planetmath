  "definition": "The natural deduction system for classical propositional logic described\nhere is based on the language that consists of a set of propositional\nvariables, a symbol $\\perp$ for falsity, and two logical connectives\n$\\land$ and $\\to$. The other connectives are defined as follows:\n\n-   $\\neg A := A\\to \\perp$,\n\n-   $A\\lor B:= \\neg (\\neg A \\land \\neg B)$,\n\n-   $A\\leftrightarrow B:=(A\\to B)\\land (B\\to A)$.\n\nIn this system, there are no axioms, only rules of inference.\n\n1.  for $\\land$, there are three rules, one introduction rule\n    $\\land\\!I$, and two elimination rules $\\land\\! E_L$ and\n    $\\land\\! E_R$:\n    $$\\infer[(\\land\\!I)]{A\\land B}{A & \\quad B} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\land\\!E_L)]{A}{A \\land B}  \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\land\\!E_R)]{B}{A \\land B}$$\n\n2.  for $\\to$, there are two rules, one introduction $\\to\\!I$ and one\n    elimination $\\to\\!E$ (modus ponens):\n    $$\\infer[(\\to\\!I)]{A\\to B}{\\infer*{B}{[A]}} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\to\\!E)]{B}{A & \\quad A \\rightarrow B}$$\n\n3.  for $\\perp$, there are two rules, one introduction $\\perp\\!I$ (ex\n    falso quodlibet), and one RAA (reductio ad absurdum):\n    $$\\infer[(\\perp\\!I)]{A}{\\perp} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(RAA)]{A}{\\infer*{\\perp}{[\\neg A]}}$$\n\n**Remark**. In the rules $\\to\\!I$ and RAA, the square brackets around\nthe top formula denote that the formula is removed, or *discharged*. In\nother words,\n\n\u201conce the conclusion is reached, the assumption can be dropped.\u201d\n\nIn $\\to\\!I$, when the formula $B$ is deduced from the assumption or\nhypothesis $A$, we conclude with the formula $A\\to B$. Once this\nconclusion is reached, $A$ is superfluous and therefore removed, as it\nis embodied in the formula $A\\to B$. This is often encountered in\nmathematical proofs: if we want to prove $A\\to B$, we first assume $A$,\nthen we proceed with the proof and reach $B$, and therefore $A\\to B$.\nSimiarly, in RAA, to prove $A$, we start by assuming $\\neg A$, and then\nreach a contradiction ($\\perp$), and hence we conclude with $A$. Of\ncourse, $\\neg A$ is no longer needed at this point.\n\nClassical propositional logic as defined by the natural deduction system\nabove is termed NK. Derivations and theorems for NK are defined in the\nusual manner like all natural deduction systems, which can be found .\nSome of the theorems of NK are listed below:\n\n-   $A\\to (B\\to A)$\n\n-   $(A\\to (B\\to C))\\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$\n\n-   $(\\neg A \\to \\neg B)\\to (B \\to A)$\n\n-   $A\\land B\\to B\\land A$\n\n-   $\\neg (A\\land \\neg A)$\n\n-   $A\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\neg A$\n\nFor example, $\\vdash \\neg (A\\land \\neg A)$ as\n\nis a derivation of $(A\\land \\neg A)\\to \\perp$, which is\n$\\neg (A\\land \\neg A)$, where all of the assumptions have been\ndischarged. The subscript indicates that the discharging of the\nassumptions at the top correspond to the application of the inference\nrule $\\to\\!I$ at the bottom.\n\nNote also that the first three theorems are the axiom schemas for the\nukasiewicz\u2019s axiom system for propositional logic, and it is easy to see\nthat NK and the axiom system are in fact deductively equivalent: the\ntheorems in both systems are precisely the same. In addition to the\ntheorems above, we also have the following meta-theorems:\n\n1.  $A, \\neg A \\vdash \\perp$,\n\n2.  if $\\Sigma \\cup \\lbrace A \\rbrace \\vdash \\perp$, then\n    $\\Sigma\\vdash \\neg A$,\n\n3.  $A \\vdash A\\lor B$ and $B \\vdash A\\lor B$,\n\n4.  if $\\Sigma \\cup \\lbrace A \\rbrace \\vdash C$ and\n    $\\Sigma \\cup \\lbrace B \\rbrace \\vdash C$, then\n    $\\Sigma \\cup \\lbrace A\\lor B\\rbrace \\vdash C$.\n\n**Remark**. If $\\neg$ and $\\lor$ were introduced as primitive logical\nsymbols instead of them as being \u201cdefined\u201d, then we need to have\ninference rules for $\\neg$ and $\\lor$ as well:\n\n1.  for $\\neg$, there are two rules, one introduction $\\neg I$ and one\n    elimination $\\neg E$:\n    $$\\infer[(\\neg I)]{\\neg A}{\\infer*{\\perp}{[A]}} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\neg E)]{\\perp}{A & \\quad \\neg A}$$\n\n2.  for $\\lor$, there are three rules, two introduction rules\n    $\\lor\\!I_E$, $\\lor\\!I_L$, and one elimination rule $\\lor\\! E$:\n    $$\\infer[(\\lor\\!I_L)]{A\\lor B}{A}  \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\lor\\!I_R)]{A\\lor B}{B} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\lor\\!E)]{C}{A \\lor B & \\quad \\infer*{C}{[A]} \\quad \\infer*{C}{[B]}}$$\n\nNote that the inference rules correspond to the meta-theorems above:\nrule $\\neg E$ corresponds to meta-theorem 1, $\\neg  I$ corresponds to 2,\n$\\lor\\!I_L$ and $\\lor\\!I_R$ correspond to 3, and $\\lor\\!E$ to 4. The\nresulting system is deductively equivalent to original NK system.",
