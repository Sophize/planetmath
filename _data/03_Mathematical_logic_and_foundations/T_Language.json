  "definition": "Let $\\Sigma$ be an alphabet. We then define the following using the\npowers of an alphabet and infinite union, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Sigma^+ & = & \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\Sigma^n \\\\\n\\Sigma^* & = & \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\Sigma^n = \\Sigma^+ \\cup \\{\\lambda\\}\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the element called *empty string*. A *string* is an\nelement of $\\Sigma^*$, meaning that it is a grouping of symbols from\n$\\Sigma$ one after another (via concatenation). For example, $abbc$ is a\nstring, and $cbba$ is a different string. A string is also commonly\ncalled a *word*. $\\Sigma^+$, like $\\Sigma^*$, contains all finite\nstrings except that $\\Sigma^+$ does not contain the empty string\n$\\lambda$. Given a string $s\\in\\Sigma^*$, a string $t$ is a *substring*\nof $s$ if $s = utv$ for some strings $u,v\\in\\Sigma^*$. For example,\n$lp, al, ha, alpha$, and $\\lambda$ (the empty string) are all substrings\nof the string $alpha$.\n\n**Definition**. A *language* over an alphabet $\\Sigma$ is a subset of\n$\\Sigma^*$, meaning that it is a of strings made from the symbols in the\nalphabet $\\Sigma$.\n\nTake for example an alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{\\clubsuit, \\wp, 63, a, A \\}$.\nThe following are all languages over $\\Sigma$:\n\n-   $\\{aaa, \\lambda, A\\wp63, 63\\clubsuit, AaAaA\\}$,\n\n-   $\\{\\wp a,\\wp aa, \\wp aaa, \\wp aaaa, \\cdots\\}$,\n\n-   The empty set $ \\varnothing $. In the context of languages,\n    $\\varnothing$ is called the *empty language*.\n\n-   $\\lbrace 63 \\rbrace$\n\n-   $\\lbrace a^{2n}\\mid n\\ge 0 \\rbrace$\n\nA language $L$ is said to be *proper* if the empty string does not\nbelong to it: $\\lambda\\notin L$. A proper language is also said to be\n*$\\lambda$-free*. Otherwise, it is *improper*. In the examples above,\nall but the first and the last examples are $\\lambda$-free. $L$ is a\n*finite language* if $L$ is a finite set, and *atomic* if it is a\nsingleton subset of $\\Sigma$, such as the fourth example above. A\nlanguage can be arbitrarily formed, or constructed via some set of rules\ncalled a formal grammar.\n\nGiven a language $L$ over $\\Sigma$, the *alphabet of $L$* is defined as\nthe maximal subset $\\Sigma(L)$ of $\\Sigma$ such that every symbol in\n$\\Sigma(L)$ occurs in some word in $L$. Equivalently, define the\nalphabet of a word $w$ to be the set $\\Sigma(w)$ of all symbols that\noccur in $w$, then $\\Sigma(L)$ is the union of all $\\Sigma(w)$, where\n$w$ ranges over $L$.\n\n**Remark**. A language can also be described in terms of \u201cinfinite\u201d\nalphabets. For example, in model theory, a language is built from a set\nof symbols, together with a set of variables. These sets are often\ninfinite. Another way of generalizing the notion of a language is to\nallow the strings to have infinite lengths. The way to do this is to\nthink of a string as a partial function $f$ from some set $X$ to the\nalphabet $A$ such that $|\\operatorname{dom}(f)|<|X|$. Then the length of\na string $f:X\\to A$ is just $|\\operatorname{dom}(f)|$. This specializes\nto the finite case if we take $X$ to be the set of all non-negative\nintegers.",
