  "definition": "Suppose we have an algebraic number such that the polynomial of smallest\ndegree it is a root of (with the co-efficients relatively prime) is\ngiven by:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i .$$\n\nThen the height $h$ of the algebraic number is given by:\n\n$$h = n + \\sum_{i=0}^n |a_i| .$$\n\nThis is a quantity which is used in the proof of the existence of\ntranscendental numbers.\n\n[99]{} Shaw, R.
