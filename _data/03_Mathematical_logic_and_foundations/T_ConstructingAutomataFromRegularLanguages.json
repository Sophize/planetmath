  "definition": "In this entry, we describe how a certain equivalence relation on words\ngives rise to a deterministic automaton, and show that deterministic\nautomata to a certain extent can be characterized by these equivalence\nrelations.\n\n### Constructing the automaton {#constructing-the-automaton .unnumbered}\n\nLet $\\Sigma$ be an alphabet and $R$ a subset of $\\Sigma^*$, the set of\nall words over $\\Sigma$. Consider an equivalence relation $\\equiv$ on\n$\\Sigma^*$ satisfying the following two conditions:\n\n-   $\\equiv$ is a right congruence: if $u\\equiv v$, then $uw\\equiv vw$\n    for any word $w$ over $\\Sigma$,\n\n-   $u \\equiv v$ implies that $u\\in R$ iff $v\\in R$.\n\nAn example of this is the Nerode equivalence $\\mathcal{N}_R$ of $R$ (in\nfact, the largest such relation).\n\nWe can construct an automaton $A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,I,F)$ based on\n$\\equiv$. Here\u2019s how:\n\n-   $S=\\Sigma^*/\\equiv$, the set of equivalence classes of $\\equiv$;\n    elements of $S$ are denoted by $[u]$ for any $u\\in \\Sigma^*$,\n\n-   $\\delta:S\\times \\Sigma \\to S$ is given by $\\delta([u],a)=[ua]$,\n\n-   $I$ is a singleton consisting of $[\\lambda]$, the equivalence class\n    consisting of the empty word $\\lambda$,\n\n-   $F$ is the set consisting of $[u]$, where $u\\in R$.\n\nBy condition 1, $\\delta$ is well-defined, so $A$ is a deterministic\nautomaton. By the second condition above, $[u]\\in F$ iff $u\\in R$.\n\nBy induction, we see that $\\delta([u],v)=[uv]$ for any word $v$ over\n$\\Sigma$. So\n$$u\\equiv v \\qquad \\mbox{iff} \\qquad \\delta([u],\\lambda)=\\delta([v],\\lambda).$$\nOne consequence of this is that $A$ is accessible (all states are\naccessible).\n\nIn addition, $R=L(A)$, as $u\\in L(A)$ iff $\\delta([\\lambda],u)\\in F$ iff\n$[u]\\in F$ iff $u\\in R$.\n\n### Constructing the equivalence relation {#constructing-the-equivalence-relation .unnumbered}\n\nConversely, given a deterministic automaton\n$A=(S,\\Sigma,\\delta,\\lbrace q_0\\rbrace,F)$, a binary relation $\\equiv$\non $\\Sigma^*$ may be defined:\n$$u\\equiv v\\qquad \\mbox{iff} \\qquad \\delta(q_0,u)=\\delta(q_0,v).$$ This\nbinary relation is clearly an equivalence relation, and it satisfies the\ntwo conditions above, with $R=L(A)$:\n\n-   $\\delta(q_0,uw)=\\delta(\\delta(q_0,u),w)= \\delta(\\delta(q_0,v),w)=\\delta(q_0,vw)$,\n\n-   if $\\delta(q_0,u)=\\delta(q_0,v)$, then clearly $u\\in L(A)$ iff\n    $v\\in L(A)$.\n\nSo $[u]=\\lbrace v \\in S \\mid \\delta(q_0,v)=\\delta(q_0,u)\\rbrace$.\n\n**Remark**. We could have defined the binary relation $u \\equiv v$ to\nmean $\\delta(q,u)=\\delta(q,v)$ for all $q\\in S$. This is also an\nequivalence relation that satisfies both of the conditions above.\nHowever, this is stronger in the sense that $\\equiv$ is a congruence: if\n$u\\equiv v$, then\n$\\delta(q,wu)=\\delta(\\delta(q,w),u)=\\delta( \\delta(q,w),v) = \\delta(q,wv)$\nso that $wu\\equiv wv$. In this entry, only the weaker assumption that\n$\\equiv$ is a right congruence is needed.\n\n### Characterization {#characterization .unnumbered}\n\nFix an alphabet $\\Sigma$ and a set $R\\subseteq \\Sigma^*$. Let $X$ the\nset of equivalence relations satisfying the two conditions above, and\n$Y$ the set of accessible deterministic automata over $\\Sigma$ accepting\n$R$. Define $f:X\\to Y$ and $g:Y\\to X$ such that $f(\\equiv)$ and $g(A)$\nare the automaton and relation constructed above.\n\n$g\\circ f=1_X$ and $f(g(A))$ is isomorphic to $A$.\n\nSuppose\n$\\equiv_1 \\; \\stackrel{f}{\\mapsto} A \\stackrel{g}{\\mapsto} \\; \\equiv_2$.\nThen $u \\equiv_1 v$ iff $\\delta([u],\\lambda)=\\delta([v],\\lambda)$ iff\n$\\delta([\\lambda],u) = \\delta([\\lambda],v)$ iff $u\\equiv_2 v$.\n\nConversely, suppose\n$A_1=(S_1,\\Sigma,\\delta_1,q_1,F_2) \\stackrel{g}{\\mapsto} \\; \\equiv \\; \\stackrel{f}{\\mapsto} A_2=(S_2,\\Sigma,\\delta_2,q_2,F_2)$.\nThen $S_2=\\Sigma^*/\\equiv$, $q_2=[\\lambda]$, and $F_2$ consists of all\n$[u]$ such that $u\\in L(A_1)$. As a result, $u\\in L(A_2)$ iff\n$\\delta_2([\\lambda],u)=\\delta_2(q_2,u)\\in F_2$ iff\n$[u]=\\delta_2([u],\\lambda)\\in F_2$ iff $u\\in L(A_1)$. This shows that\n$A_1$ is equivalent to $A_2$.\n\nTo show $A_1$ is isomorphic to $A_2$, define $\\phi:S_2\\to S_1$ by\n$\\phi([u])=\\delta_1(q_1,u)$. Then\n\n-   $\\phi$ is well-defined by the definition of $\\equiv$, and it is\n    injective for the same reason. Now, let $s\\in S$, then since $A_1$\n    is accessible, there is a word $u$ such that $\\delta_1(q_1,u)=s$, so\n    that $\\phi([u])=s$. This shows that $\\phi$ is a bijection.\n\n-   $\\phi(q_2)=\\phi([\\lambda])=\\delta_1(q_1,\\lambda)=q_1$.\n\n-   $\\phi([u]) \\in F_1$ iff $\\delta_1(q_1,u)\\in F_1$ iff\n    $u\\in L(A_1)=L(A_2)$ iff $[u]\\in F_2$. Therefore, $\\phi(F_2)=F_1$.\n\n-   Finally,\n    $\\phi(\\delta_2([u],a))=\\phi([ua])=\\delta_1(q_1,ua)=\\delta_1(\\delta_1(q_1,u),a)=\\delta_1(\\phi([u]),a)$.\n\nThus, $\\phi$ is a homomorphism from $A_1$ to $A_2$, together with the\nfact that $\\phi$ is a bijection, $A_1$ is isormorphic to $A_2$.\n\nIf $\\equiv$ is the Nerode equivalence of $R$, then the $f(\\equiv)$ is a\nreduced automaton. If $A$ is reduced, then $g(A)$ is the Nerode\nequivalence of $R$.\n\nSuppose $\\equiv$ is the Nerode equivlance. If $f(\\equiv)$ is not\nreduced, reduce it to a reduced automaton $A$. Then\n$\\equiv \\subseteq g(A)$. Since $g(A)$ satisfies the two conditions above\nand $\\equiv$ is the largest such relation, $\\equiv = g(A)$. Therefore\n$f(\\equiv)=f(g(A))$ is isomorphic to $A$. But $A$ is reduced, so must\n$f(\\equiv)$.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose $A$ is reduced. Then\n$g(A) \\subseteq \\mathcal{N}_R$. Conversely, if $u \\mathcal{N}_R v$, then\n$uw\\in R$ iff $vw\\in R$ for any word $w$, so that\n$\\delta(q_0,uw)=\\delta(q_0,vw)$, or\n$\\delta(\\delta(q_0,u),w)=\\delta(\\delta(q_0,v),w)$, which implies\n$\\delta(q_0,u)$ and $\\delta(q_0,v)$ are indistinguishable. But $A$ is\nreduced, this means $\\delta(q_0,u) = \\delta(q_0,v)$. As a result\n$u g(A) v$, or $g(A) = \\mathcal{N}_R$.\n\n**Definition**. A *Myhill-Nerode relation* for $R\\subseteq \\Sigma^*$ is\nan equivalence relation $\\equiv$ that satisfies the two conditions\nabove, and that $\\Sigma^*/\\equiv$ is finite.\n\nCombining from what we just discussed above, we see that a language $R$\nis regular iff its Nerode equivalence is a Myhill-Nerode relation, which\nis the essence of Myhill-Nerode theorem.",
