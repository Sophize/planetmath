  "definition": "Deductions are formalizations of proofs. Informally, they can be viewed\nas arriving at a conclusion from a set of assumptions, via applications\nof some prescribed rules in a finite number of steps.\n\nThere are several ways to formally define what a deduction is, given a\ndeductive system. We will explore some of them here.\n\n### Deduction as a Sequence {#deduction-as-a-sequence .unnumbered}\n\nGiven a deductive system, a deduction from a set $\\Delta$ of\n(well-formed) formulas can be thought of as a finite sequence of wff\u2019s\n$$A_1, A_2, \\cdots, A_n$$ such that $A_i$ is either an axiom, an element\nof $\\Delta$, or as the result of an application of an inference rule $R$\nto earlier wff\u2019s $A_{i_1},\\ldots, A_{i_k}$, where $i_1,\\ldots,i_k < i$.\nIf $A_i$ is an element of $\\Delta$, we call $A_i$ an *assumption* or a\n*hypothesis*. This way of presenting a deduction is said to be *linear*.\n\nDeductions presented this way are also called *deduction sequences* or\n*proof sequences*. Deductions in Hilbert-style axiom systems are\npresented this way.\n\n### Deduction as a Tree {#deduction-as-a-tree .unnumbered}\n\nAlternatively, a deduction can be thought of as a labeled rooted tree.\nThe nodes are labeled by formulas, and for each node with label, say\n$Y$, its immediate predecessors (children) are nodes whose labels are,\nsay $X_1,\\ldots, X_n$ which are premises of some inference rule $R$.\nDeductions presented this way are also called *deduction trees* or\n*proof trees*. In a deduction tree, the labels of the leaves are either\nthe axioms, or assumptions (from some set $\\Delta$), and the label of\nthe root of the tree is the conclusion of the deduction. Below is an\nexample of a deduction tree:\n$$\\pstree[treemode=U,levelsep=1cm,nodesep=2pt]\n{\\Tr{Z}}{\n\\pstree{\\Tr{Y}}\n{\\Tr{X_1}\\Tr{X_2}}\n}$$ Here, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are assumptions and $Y$ the corresponding\nconclusion of some (binary) rule $R$, and $Y$ is the assumption and $Z$\nis the conclusion of some (unary) rule $S$. Inference rules may be\nspecified as labels of the edges.\n\nDeductions in deduction systems such as natural deduction or sequent\ncalculus are presented this way. In those systems, the edges of the\ntrees are replaced by horizontal lines, dividing premises and\nconclusions, and rules are sometimes specified next to the lines, in the\nfollowing fashion:\n\n### Deducibility Relation {#deducibility-relation .unnumbered}\n\nGiven a deductive system $D$, if $B$ is the conclusion of a deduction\nfrom a set $\\Delta$, we write $$\\Delta \\vdash_D B.$$ If $\\Gamma$ is\nanother set of wff\u2019s, we also write $\\Delta, \\Gamma \\vdash_D B$ to mean\n$\\Delta\\cup\\Gamma \\vdash_D B$. In addition, if\n$\\Gamma =\\lbrace A_1,\\ldots, A_n\\rbrace$, we write\n$$A_1,\\ldots, A_n \\vdash_D B \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad \\Delta, A_1,\\ldots, A_n \\vdash_D B$$\nto mean $\\Gamma \\vdash_D B$ and $\\Delta\\cup \\Gamma \\vdash_D B$\nrespectively. Furthermore, we may also remove the subscript $D$ and\nwrite $$\\Delta \\vdash B$$ if no confusion arises. When\n$\\Delta \\vdash B$, we also say that $B$ is *deducible* from $\\Delta$.\nThe turnstile symbol $\\vdash$ is also called the *deducibility\nrelation*.\n\nIf a formula $A$ is deducible from $\\varnothing$, we say that $A$ is a\ntheorem (of the corresponding deductive system). In symbol, we write\n$$\\vdash_D A \\qquad \\mbox{or} \\qquad \\vdash A.$$\n\nA property of $\\vdash$ is the following:\n\n> if $\\vdash A$ and $A \\vdash B$, then $\\vdash B$.\n\nIn other words, if $A$ is a theorem, and $B$ can be deduced from $A$,\nthen $B$ is also a theorem, which conforms with our intuition. More\ngenerally, we have\n\n> if $\\Delta \\vdash A$ and $\\Gamma, A \\vdash B$, then\n> $\\Delta, \\Gamma \\vdash B$.\n\n**Remark**. We refrain from calling a deduction a proof. As we have seen\nearlier, deductions are mathematical abstractions of proofs. So they are\nmathematical constructed, viewed either as sequences or trees (of\nformulas). On the other hand, in the literature, \u201cproof\u201d is usually\nreserved to be used in the meta-language, as in the \u201cproof\u201d of Fermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem, etc...\n\n[0]{} A. S.
