  "statement": "The cardinality of a set is unique.\n\nWe will verify the result for finite sets only. Suppose $A$ is a finite\nset with cardinality $\\mid A\\mid=n$ and $\\mid A\\mid=m$. Then there exist\nbijections $f:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow A$ and\n$g:\\mathbb{N}_m\\rightarrow A$. Since $g$ is a bijection, it is\ninvertible, and $g^{-1}:A\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_m$ is a bijection. Then\nthe composition $g^{-1}\\circ f$ is a bijection from $\\mathbb{N}_n$ to\n$\\mathbb{N}_m$. We will show by induction on $n$ that $m=n$. In the case\n$n=1$ we have $\\mathbb{N}_n=\\mathbb{N}_1=\\{1\\}$, and it must be that\n$\\mathbb{N}_m=\\{1\\}$ as well, whence $m=1=n$. Now let\n$n\\geq 1\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and suppose that, for all $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the\nexistence of a bijection $f:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_m$ implies\n$n=m$. Let $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and suppose\n$h:\\mathbb{N}_{n+1}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_m$ is a bijection. Let\n$k=h(n+1)$, and notice that $1\\leq k\\leq m$. Since $h$ is onto there\nexists some $j\\in\\mathbb{N}_{n+1}$ such that $f(j)=m$. There are two\ncases to consider. If $j=n+1$, then we may define\n$\\phi:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_{m-1}$ by $\\phi(i)=h(i)$ for all\n$i\\in\\mathbb{N}_n$, which is clearly a bijection, so by the inductive\nhypothesis $n=m-1$, and thus $n+1=m$. Now suppose $j\\neq n+1$, and\ndefine $\\phi:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_{m-1}$ by $$\\phi(i)=\n\\begin{cases}\nh(i)&\\text{if }i\\neq j\\\\\nk&\\text{if }i=j\\\\\n\\end{cases}\\text{.}$$ We first show that $\\phi$ is one-to-one. Let\n$i_1,i_2\\in\\mathbb{N}_n$, where $i_1\\neq i_2$. First consider the case\nwhere neither $i_1$ nor $i_2$ is equal to $j$. Then, since $h$ is\none-to-one, we have $$\\phi(i_1)=h(i_1)\\neq h(i_2)=\\phi(i_2)\\text{.}$$ In\nthe case $i_1=j$, again because $h$ is one-to-one, we have\n$$\\phi(i_1)=k=h(n+1)\\neq h(i_2)=\\phi(i_2)\\text{.}$$ Similarly it can be\nshown that, if $i_2=j$, $\\phi(i_1)\\neq \\phi(i_2)$, so $\\phi$ is\none-to-one. We now show that $\\phi$ is onto. Let $l\\in\\mathbb{N}_{m-1}$.\nIf $l=k$, then we may take $i=j$ to have $\\phi(i)=\\phi(j)=k=l$. If\n$l\\neq k$, then, because $h$ is onto, there exists some\n$i\\in\\mathbb{N}_{n}$ such that $h(i)=l$, so $g(i)=h(i)=l$. Thus $g$ is\nonto, and our inductive hypothesis again gives $n=m-1$, hence $n+1=m$.\nSo by the principle of induction, the result holds for all $n$.\nReturning now to our set $A$ and our bijection\n$g^{-1}\\circ f:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}_m$, we may conclude\nthat $m=n$, and consequently that the cardinality of $A$ is unique, as\ndesired.\n\nThere does not exist a bijection from a finite set to a proper subset of\nitself.\n\nWithout a loss of generality we may assume the proper subset is\nnonempty, for if the set is empty then the corollary holds vacuously. So\nlet $A$ be as above with cardinality $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, $B$ a proper\nsubset of $A$ with cardinality $m<n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and suppose\n$f:A\\rightarrow B$ is a bijection. By hypothesis there exist bijections\n$g:\\mathbb{N}_n\\rightarrow A$ and $h:\\mathbb{N}_m\\rightarrow B$; but\nthen $h^{-1}\\circ(f\\circ g)$ is a bijection from $\\mathbb{N}_n$ to\n$\\mathbb{N}_m$, whence by the preceding result $n=m$, contrary to\nassumption.\n\nThe corollary is also known more popularly as the pigeonhole principle.",
