  "definition": "The modal logic **GL** (after G\u00f6del and L\u00f6b) is the smallest normal\nmodal logic containing the following schema:\n\n-   W: $\\square (\\square A \\to A ) \\to \\square A$.\n\n**GL** is also known as *provability logic*, because it is used to study\nthe provability and consistency of first order Peano arithmetic.\n\nRecall that 4 is the schema $\\square A \\to \\square \\square A$.\n\nIn any normal modal logic, $\\vdash W$ implies $\\vdash 4$.\n\nThe proof of this requires some and of a normal modal logic.\n\nWe start with the tautology\n$A \\to ((\\square \\square A \\land \\square A) \\to (\\square A \\land A))$,\nwhich an instance of the schema $X \\to ((Y\\land Z)\\to (Z \\land X))$.\nSince\n$\\square (\\square A \\land A) \\leftrightarrow \\square \\square A \\land \\square A$\nis a theorem in any normal modal logic,\n$A \\to (\\square (\\square A \\land A) \\to (\\square A\\land A))$ is a\ntheorem by the substitution theorem. By the syntactic property RM,\n$\\square A \\to \\square (\\square (\\square A \\land A) \\to (\\square A\\land A))$\nis a theorem. Since\n$\\square (\\square (\\square A \\land A) \\to (\\square A\\land A)) \\to \\square (\\square A \\land A)$\nis an instance of W, by law of syllogism,\n$\\square A \\to \\square (\\square A \\land A)$ is a theorem.\n\nNext, from the tautology $\\square A \\land A \\to \\square A$, we have the\ntheorem $\\square (\\square A\\land A) \\to \\square \\square A$ by RM.\nCombining this with the last theorem in the previous paragraph, we see\nthat, by law of syllogism, $\\square A \\to \\square \\square A$, or 4, is a\ntheorem.\n\n4 is a theorem of **GL**.\n\nA binary relation is said to be *converse well-founded* iff its inverse\nis well-founded.\n\nW is valid in a frame $\\mathcal{F}$ iff $\\mathcal{F}$ is transitive and\nconverse well-founded.\n\nSuppose first that the schema W is valid in $\\mathcal{F}=(U,R)$, then\nany theorem of **GL** is valid in $\\mathcal{F}$, so in particular 4 is\nvalid in $\\mathcal{F}$, and hence $\\mathcal{F}$ is transitive (see ). We\nnext show that $R$ is converse well-founded. Suppose not. Then there is\na non-empty subset $S\\subseteq U$ such that $S$ has no $R$-maximal\nelement. We want to find a model $(U,R,V)$ such that, for some\npropositional variable $p$ and some world $u$ in $U$,\n$\\not \\models_u \\square (\\square p \\to p) \\to \\square p$, or\nequivalently, $\\models_u \\square (\\square p\\to p)$ and\n$\\not \\models_u \\square p$. Let $V$ be the valuation such that\n$V(p):=\\lbrace w \\in U \\mid w \\notin S \\rbrace$. Pick any $u\\in S$.\nSuppose $u R v$. To show that $\\models_u \\square (\\square p\\to p)$, we\nwant to show that $\\models_v \\square p \\to p$. There are two cases:\n\n-   If $v\\in S$, then $\\not \\models_v p$. Furthermore, since $S$ does\n    not contain an $R$-maximal element, there is a $w\\in S$ such that\n    $v R w$. Since $w\\in S$, $\\not\\models_w p$. Since $v R w$,\n    $\\not \\models_v \\square p$. As a result,\n    $\\models_v \\square p \\to p$.\n\n-   If $v\\notin S$, then $\\models_v p$, so that\n    $\\models_v \\square p \\to p$.\n\nNext, we want to show that $\\not \\models_u \\square p$. Since $u\\in S$,\nand $S$ does not have an $R$-maximal element, there is a $w\\in S$ such\nthat $u R w$. Since $w\\in S$, $\\not \\models_w p$. But since $u R w$,\n$\\not \\models_u \\square p$.\n\nConversely, let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a transitive and converse well-founded\nframe, $M$ a model based on $\\mathcal{F}$, and $u$ a world in $M$. We\nwant to show that $\\models_u \\square (\\square p\\to p) \\to \\square p$. So\nsuppose $\\not \\models_u \\square p$. Then the set\n$S:=\\lbrace v\\mid u R v \\mbox{ and } \\not \\models_v p \\rbrace$ is not\nempty. Since $R$ is converse well-founded, $S$ has a $R$-maximal\nelement, say $w$. So $u R w$ and $\\not \\models_w p$. Now, if\n$\\models_w \\square p \\to p$, then $\\not \\models_w \\square p$, which\nmeans there is a $v$ such that $w R v$ and $\\not \\models_v p$. But since\n$R$ is transitive and $u R w$, we get $u R v$, implying $v \\in S$,\ncontradicting the $R$-maximality of $w$. Therefore,\n$\\not \\models_w \\square p \\to p$, or\n$\\not \\models_u \\square (\\square p \\to p)$. As a result,\n$\\models_u \\square (\\square p \\to p) \\to \\square p$.\n\nProposition 2 immediately implies\n\n**GL** is sound in the class of transitive and converse well-founded\nframes.\n\n**Remark**. However, unlike many other modal logics, **GL** *is not*\ncomplete in the class of transitive and converse well-founded frames.\nWhile its canonical model (hence the corresponding canonical frame) is\ntransitive (because 4 is valid in it), it is not converse well-founded.\n\nInstead, it can be shown that **GL** *is* complete in the restricted\nclass of finite transitive and converse well-founded frames, or\nequivalently, finite transitive and irreflexive frames.",
