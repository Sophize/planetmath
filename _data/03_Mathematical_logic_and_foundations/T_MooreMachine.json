  "definition": "A *Moore machine* $M$ is a five-tuple\n$(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\sigma,\\lambda)$, where\n\n1.  $S$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *states*,\n\n2.  $\\Sigma$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *input symbols*,\n\n3.  $\\Delta$ is an alphabet whose elements are called *output symbols*,\n\n4.  $\\sigma: S\\times \\Sigma \\to S$ is a function called the *state\n    transition function*,\n\n5.  $\\lambda: S \\to \\Delta$ is a function called the *output function*.\n\nGiven an a pair $(s,a)$ of state $s$ and input symbol $a$, the value\n$\\sigma(s,a)$ is the *next state* of $(s,a)$ and $\\lambda(s)$ is the\n*output* of $(s,a)$.\n\nA Moore machine can be thought of as a Mealy machine, where that the\noutput function does not depend on the input. Suppose\n$M=(S,\\Sigma,\\Delta,\\sigma,\\lambda)$ is a Moore machine, then\n$M'=(S,\\Sigma, \\Delta,\\sigma,\\lambda')$ where\n$\\lambda':S\\times \\Sigma \\to \\Delta$, given by\n$\\lambda'(s,a)=\\lambda(s)$, is a Mealy machine.\n\nLike a Mealy machine, a Moore machine also has two visual presentations:\nvia a *flow table*, which describes the transitions to the next states\nand the outputs, or via a *state diagram*.\n\nFor example, consider a Moore machine $M$ where $S=\\lbrace s,t\\rbrace$,\n$\\Sigma = \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and $\\Delta = \\lbrace x,y\\rbrace$. The\nstate transition function $\\sigma$ and the output function $\\lambda$ are\ndefined by the following table:\n\n         $a$   $b$  \n  ----- ----- ----- -----\n   $s$   $t$   $s$   $y$\n   $t$   $s$   $t$   $x$\n\nThe first column represents all the states of $M$; the second and third\ncolumns are the next states corresponding to the input symbols specified\non the top row; and the last column shows the corresponding output\nsymbols.\n\nIn addition, one can visualize a Moore machine $M$ by way its state\ndiagram $G_M$, which is just a (labeled) directed graph. $G_M$ is\nconstructed as follows: the vertices of $G_M$ represent the states of\n$M$, and each is labeled $s|x$, where $s$ is some state of $M$, and\n$x=\\lambda(s)$. An edge from vertices $(s,x)$ to $(t,y)$ is constructed\niff there is an input $a$ such that $\\sigma(s,a)=t$, in which case the\nedge is labeled $a$. In the example above, the state diagram $G_M$ of\n$M$ is the following\n\n![image](moore.eps)\n\nLet $M$ be a Moore machine. Since $M$ is a special type of a Mealy\nmachine, modification of the transition and output functions of $M$ to\nhandle input words could be defined much the same way as if we were\ntreating $M$ as a Mealy machine. But the downside is is that no output\ncan correspond to the empty input word $\\epsilon$. Because the output\nfunction $\\lambda$ of $M$ is input-independent, a slightly different\napproach to modification gets rid of the problem:\n\nFirst, define the extension of the transition function $\\sigma$ of $M$\nas if it were a Mealy machine:\n$$\\sigma(s,\\epsilon):=s, \\mbox{ and } \\sigma(s,ua):=\\sigma(\\sigma(s,u),a), \\mbox{ where }s\\in S, u\\in \\Sigma^*, a\\in \\Sigma.$$\nNext, define a function $\\beta: S\\times \\Sigma^* \\to \\Delta$ as follows:\n$$\\beta(s,u):=\\lambda(\\sigma(s,u)), \\mbox{ where }s\\in S, u\\in \\Sigma^*.$$\nCall $\\beta$ the output function on input *words* for $M$. Notice that\n$\\beta$ is not an extension of $\\lambda$, since $\\beta$ is\n*input-dependent*, whereas $\\lambda$ is not. Furthermore,\n$\\beta(s,\\epsilon) = \\lambda(s)$.\n\nThe approach above shows that the mechanism of a Moore machine for\nhandling inputs/outputs is different from that of a Mealy machine, even\nthough a Moore machine is really just a Mealy machine.\n\n[8]{} S.
