  "definition": "[**Definition**]{} A set is *uncountable* if it is not countable. In\nother words, a set $S$ is uncountable, if there is no subset of\n${\\mathbb{N}}$ (the set of natural numbers) with the same cardinality as\n$S$.\n\n1.  All uncountable sets are infinite. However, the converse is not\n    true, as ${\\mathbb{N}}$ is both infinite and countable.\n\n2.  The real numbers form an uncountable set. The famous proof of this\n    result is based on Cantor\u2019s diagonal argument.",
