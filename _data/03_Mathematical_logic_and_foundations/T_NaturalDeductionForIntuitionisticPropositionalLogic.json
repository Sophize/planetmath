  "definition": "The natural deduction system for intuitionistic propositional logic\ndescribed here is based on the language that consists of a set of\npropositional variables, a symbol $\\perp$ for falsity, and logical\nconnectives $\\land$, $\\lor$, $\\to$. In this system, there are no axioms,\nonly rules of inference.\n\n1.  for $\\land$, there are three rules, one introduction rule\n    $\\land\\!I$, and two elimination rules $\\land\\! E_L$ and\n    $\\land\\! E_R$:\n    $$\\infer[(\\land\\!I)]{A\\land B}{A & \\quad B} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\land\\!E_L)]{A}{A \\land B} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\land\\!E_R)]{B}{A \\land B}$$\n\n2.  for $\\to$, there are two rules, one introduction $\\to\\!I$ and one\n    elimination $\\to\\!E$ (modus ponens):\n    $$\\infer[(\\to\\!I)]{A\\to B}{\\infer*{B}{[A]}} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\to\\!E)]{B}{A & \\quad A \\rightarrow B}$$\n\n3.  for $\\lor$, there are three rules, two introduction rules\n    $\\lor\\!I_E$, $\\lor\\!I_L$, and one elimination rule $\\lor\\! E$:\n    $$\\infer[(\\lor\\!I_L)]{A\\lor B}{A} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\lor\\!I_R)]{A\\lor B}{B} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\lor\\!E)]{C}{A \\lor B & \\quad \\infer*{C}{[A]} \\quad \\infer*{C}{[B]}}$$\n\n4.  for $\\perp$, there is one rule, an introduction rule $\\perp\\!I$ (ex\n    falso quodlibet): $$\\infer[(\\perp\\!I)]{A}{\\perp}$$\n\nIn short, intuitionistic propositional logic is classical propositional\nlogic without the rule RAA (reductio ad absurdum). Furthermore, $\\neg$\nis a defined one-place logical symbol: $\\neg A:=A\\to \\perp$.\n\n**Remark**. In the rules $\\to\\!I$ and $\\lor\\!E$, the square brackets\naround the top formula denote that the formula is removed, or\n*discharged*. In other words,\n\n\u201conce the conclusion is reached, the assumption can be dropped.\u201d\n\nIn $\\to\\!I$, when the formula $B$ is deduced from the assumption or\nhypothesis $A$, we conclude with the formula $A\\to B$. Once this\nconclusion is reached, $A$ is superfluous and therefore removed, as it\nis embodied in the formula $A\\to B$. This is often encountered in\nmathematical proofs: if we want to prove $A\\to B$, we first assume $A$,\nthen we proceed with the proof and reach $B$, and therefore $A\\to B$.\nSimiarly, in $\\lor\\!E$, if $C$ can be concluded from $A$ and from $B$\nindividually, then $C$ can be concluded from anyone of them, or\n$A\\lor B$, without the assumptions $A$ and $B$ individually.\n\nIntuitionistic propositional logic as defined by the natural deduction\nsystem above is termed NJ. Derivations and theorems for NJ are defined\nin the usual manner like all natural deduction systems, which can be\nfound . Some of the theorems of NJ are listed below:\n\n-   $A\\to (B\\to A)$\n\n-   $(A\\to (B\\to C))\\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$\n\n-   $(A \\to B)\\to (\\neg B \\to \\neg A)$\n\n-   $A\\land B\\to B\\land A$\n\n-   $\\neg (A\\land \\neg A)$\n\n-   $A\\to \\neg \\neg A$\n\n-   $\\neg \\neg \\neg A \\to \\neg A$\n\nFor example, $\\vdash A \\to \\neg \\neg A$ as\n\nand $A\\to (\\neg A\\to \\perp)$ is just $A\\to \\neg \\neg A$. Also,\n$\\vdash \\neg \\neg \\neg A \\to \\neg A$, as\n\nThe subscripts indicate that the discharging of the assumptions at the\ntop correspond to the applications of the inference rules $\\to\\!I$ at\nthe bottom. The box around $A\\to \\neg \\neg A$ indicates that the\nderivation of $A\\to \\neg \\neg A$ has been embedded (as a subtree) into\nthe derivation of $\\neg \\neg \\neg A \\to \\neg A$.\n\n**Remark**. If $\\neg$ were introduced as a primitive logical symbol\ninstead of it being as \u201cdefined\u201d, then we need to have inference rules\nfor $\\neg$ as well, one of which is introduction $\\neg I$, and the other\nelimination $\\neg E$:\n$$\\infer[(\\neg I)]{\\neg A}{\\infer*{\\perp}{[A]}} \\hspace{2cm} \\infer[(\\neg E)]{\\perp}{A & \\quad \\neg A}$$\nNote that in the original NJ system, $\\neg I$ is just an instance of\n$\\to \\! I$, and $\\neg E$ is just an instance of $\\to \\! E$.",
