  "definition": "An *existential theorem* is a theorem which exists.\n\nIn general, there are two ways to prove an existential theorem. The most\nconvincing method is a constructive proof, and another common method is\nan existential proof. The reason that a constructive proof is most\nconvincing is that, after reading such a proof, readers can actually get\ntheir hands on the mathematical in question. In some cases, however,\nconstructing the mathematical is difficult, if not impossible. In this\ncase, an existential proof may be the only method for proving an\nexistential theorem. An example of this is the primitive element\ntheorem.",
