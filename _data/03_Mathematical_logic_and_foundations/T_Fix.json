  "definition": "In mathematical statements, mathematical objects such as points and\nnumbers are described as being *fixed*. A possible meaning for this\nusage is that the mathematical object in question is not allowed to vary\nthroughout the statement or proof (or, in some cases, a portion\nthereof). Although a fixed object typically does not vary, it is almost\nalways arbitrary. This may seem paradoxical, but it is quite logical: An\nobject is chosen arbitrarily, then it is never allowed to vary. See the\nentry betweenness in rays for an example of this usage.\n\nThe usage of the *fix* and *fixed* may also that a mapping sends the\nmathematical object to itself. These two usages are technically not the\nsame. The former usage (described in the previous paragraph) states a\nproperty of the mathematical object in question and is always either\npart of an implication (as in \u201cIf $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is fixed, then...\u201d)\nor a command made by the author to the reader (as in \u201cLet\n$x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be fixed.\u201d and \u201cFix $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\u201d). The latter\nusage (described in this paragraph) states a property of a mapping and\nmay or may not be part of a conditional statement or a command. The word\n\u201cfixes\u201d *always* refers to this usage (as in \u201cNote that $f$ fixes\n$x$.\u201d). See the entry for a further explanation of the latter usage.",
