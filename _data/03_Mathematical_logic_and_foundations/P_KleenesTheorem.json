  "statement": "A language over an alphabet is regular iff it can be accepted by a\nfinite automaton.\n\nThe best way to prove this theorem is to visualize a finite automaton as\na directed graph (its state diagram). We prove sufficiency and necessity\nseparately.\n\nEvery regular language can be accepted by a finite automaton.\n\nThis is done inductively. We begin with atomic languages, and work our\nway up. First, note that $\\varnothing$, $\\lbrace \\lambda\\rbrace$,\n$\\lbrace a \\rbrace$ where $a\\in \\Sigma$ are accepted by the following\nfinite automata respectively:\n\nNext, suppose that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular languages, accepted by\n$A_1$ and $A_2$ respectively. Then\n\n-   $L_1L_2$ is accepted by the finite automaton $A_1A_2$, the\n    juxtaposition of automata $A_1$ and $A_2$;\n\n-   $L_1^*$ is accepted by the finite automaton $A_1^*$, the $A_1$; and\n\n-   $L_1\\cup L_2$ is accepted by $A_1\\cup A_2$, the of $A_1$ and $A_2$.\n\nSince a regular language can only be built up this way, the proof is\ncomplete.\n\nEvery language accepted by a finite automaton is regular.\n\nNote that, using a state diagram of a finite automaton $A$, a word\naccepted by $A$ is the label of a path that begins from one of the\nstarting nodes and ends in one of the final nodes. In the proof, we\nbuild a sequence of languages\n$$L_1 \\subseteq L_2 \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq L_n$$ such that $L_1$ is\nregular, and each $L_{i+1}$ is constructed from $L_i$ by one of the\nregular operations (union, concatenation, and Kleene star), so that in\nthe end, $L_n$ is also regular. Finally, we show that $L(A)$ is a finite\nunion of such $L(n)$\u2019s, and therefore $L(A)$ is regular too.\n\nIndex the states of a finite automaton $A$ by positive integers:\n$q_1, \\ldots, q_m$. Suppose $1\\le i,j,k\\le m$. Define the language\n$L(i,j,k)$ as follows: a word is in $L(i,j,k)$ iff it is the label of a\npath from $q_i$ to $q_j$ such that each of the intermediate nodes on the\npath has an index at most $k$. Now, fix $i,j$, and do induction on $k$.\n\n1.  $L(i,j,0)$ is regular for any $i,j$. This is so because a word in\n    $L(i,j,0)$ (if it is non-empty) has length at most 1, so that it is\n    either in $\\Sigma$ or $\\lambda$. In any case, $L(i,j,0)$ is regular.\n\n2.  If $L(i,j,k)$ is regular, so is $L(i,j,k+1)$. Let $p$ be a path that\n    begins at $q_i$ and ends at $q_j$ such that all of its intermediate\n    nodes have indices no more than $k+1$. Then either none of the nodes\n    have indices more than $k$, or $q_{k+1}$ is an intermediate node. In\n    the later case, $p$ begins at $q_i$, reaches $q_{k+1}$ for the first\n    time, leaves $q_{k+1}$, may or may not return to $q_{k+1}$, until\n    its last return (if it does return), and ends at $q_j$. What we have\n    just described can be put into an identity:\n    $$L(i,j,k+1)=L(i,j,k)\\cup L(i,k+1,k)L(k+1,k+1,k)^*L(k+1,j,k).$$\n    Since each of the languages on the right hand side is regular (as\n    the last component is $k$ in each case), the language on the left\n    hand side is reqular (as it is obtained by performing regular\n    operations on regular languages).\n\nIn particular, $L(i,j,m)$ is regular. Since\n$L(A) = \\bigcup \\lbrace L(i,j,m)\\mid q_i\\in I, q_j\\in F\\rbrace$, a\nfinite union of regular languages, $L(A)$ is regular as well.\n\n**Remark**. Kleene\u2019s theorem can be generalized in at least two ways. By\nrealizing that an automaton is just a directed graph whose edges are\nlabeled by elements of $\\Sigma^*$, a finitely generated free monoid, one\nmay define a finite automaton over an arbitrary monoid. For more\ndetails, see . The other is to generalize the notion of a word from\nfinite to infinite, and modify the notion of acceptance so infinite\nwords may be accepted.",
