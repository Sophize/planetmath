  "definition": "A *polyadic algebra* is a quadruple $(B,V,\\exists,S)$, where\n$(B,V,\\exists)$ is a quantifier algebra, and $S$ is a function from the\nset of functions on $V$ to the set of endomorphisms on the Boolean\nalgebra $B$, in other words $$S:V^V\\to \\operatorname{End}(B)$$ such that\n\n1.  $S(1_V)=1_B$,\n\n2.  $S(f\\circ g)=S(f)\\circ S(g)$,\n\n3.  $S(f)\\circ \\exists(I)=S(g)\\circ \\exists(I)$ if $f(V-I)=g(V-I)$,\n\n4.  $\\exists(I)\\circ S(f) = S(f)\\circ \\exists(f^{-1}(I))$ if $f$ is\n    one-to-one when restricted to $f^{-1}(I)$.\n\nExplanation of notations: $1_V,1_B$ are identity functions on $V,B$\nrespectively; $f,g$ are functions on $V$, and $I$ is a subset of $V$.\nThe circle $\\circ$ represents functional compositions.\n\nThe *degree* and *local finiteness* of a polyadic algebra are defined as\nthe degree and local finiteness of the underlying quantifier algebra.\n\nHeuristically, the function $S$ can be thought of as changes to\npropositional functions due to a \u201csubstitution\u201d of variables (elements\nof $V$). Let us see some examples. Let\n$V=\\lbrace x_0,x_1,\\ldots \\rbrace$ be a countably indexed set of\nvariables. For any propositional function $\\varphi$, define\n$S(f)(\\varphi)$ to be the propositional function $\\varphi_1$ obtained by\nreplacing each variable $x$ that occurs in it by $f(x)$. Below are two\nexamples illustrating how $S(f)$ changes propositional functions:\n\n-   Let $f:V \\to V$ be the function given by $f(x_0)=f(x_1)=x_0$ and\n    $f(x_i)=x_{i+1}$ for all $i>1$. If $\\varphi$ is the propositional\n    function $x_0^2-x_1+x_2/x_3$, then $S(f)(\\varphi)$ is the\n    propositional function $x_0^2-x_0+x_3/x_4$.\n\n-   Let $f:V\\to V$ be the function given by $f(x_0)=x_2$, and\n    $f(x_i)=x_i$ for all $i\\ne 0$. Then the propositional function\n    \u201c$\\exists x_0,x_1,x_2 (x_0\\ne x_1 \\wedge x_1\\ne x_2 \\wedge x_2\\ne x_0)$\u201d\n    becomes\n    \u201c$\\exists x_2,x_1,x_2 (x_2\\ne x_1 \\wedge x_1\\ne x_2 \\wedge x_2\\ne x_2)$\u201d\n    under $S(f)$.\n\nIt is not hard to see from the examples above that $S(f)$ respects\nBoolean operations $\\wedge$ and $'$, which is why we want to make $S(f)$\nan endomorphism on $B$. Furthermore, the four conditions above can be\ninterpreted as\n\n1.  if there are no substitutions of variables, then there should be no\n    corresponding changes to the propositional functions\n\n2.  applying substitutions $f\\circ g$ of varaibles in a propositional\n    function $\\varphi$ should have the same effect as applying\n    substitutions $g$ of variables in $\\varphi$, followed by\n    substitutions $f$ of variables in $S(g)(\\varphi)$\n\n3.  a substitution $f$ of variables should have no effect to a\n    propositional function beginning with $\\exists$ if every variable\n    bound by $\\exists$ is fixed by $f$. For example, if we replace $f$\n    in the second example above by $f(x_3)=x_2$ and $f(x_i)=x_i$\n    otherwise, then\n    $$``\\exists x_0,x_1,x_2 (x_0\\ne x_1 \\wedge x_1\\ne x_2 \\wedge x_2\\ne x_0)\"$$\n    is unchanged by $S(f)$, since $x_0,x_1,x_2$ are all fixed by $f$.\n\n4.  Let $\\varphi=\\exists I \\psi(I,J)$ be a propositional function, where\n    $I,J$ are sets of variables with $I$ bound by $\\exists$ and $J$\n    free. If no two variables $I$ get mapped to the same variable, and\n    no free variable (in $J$) becomes bound (in $f(I)$) under the\n    substitution, then $\\exists I \\psi(f(I),f(J))$ and\n    $\\exists f(I) \\psi(f(I),f(J))$ are semantically the same, which is\n    exactly the statement in the condition.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Paul Halmos first introduced the notion of polyadic algebras. In his\n    *Algebraic Logic*, a compilation of articles on the subject, he\n    called a function on the set $V$ of variables a transformation, and\n    the triple $(B,V,S)$ satisfying the first two conditions above a\n    *transformation algebra*. Therefore, a polyadic algebra is a\n    quadruple $(B,V,\\exists,S)$ where $(B,V,\\exists)$ is a quantifier\n    algebra and $(B,V,S)$ is a transformation algebra, such that\n    conditions 3 and 4 above are satisfied.\n\n-   The notion of polyadic algebras generalizes the notion of monadic\n    algebras. Indeed, a monadic algebra is a polyadic algebra where $V$\n    is a singleton.\n\n-   Just as a Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is the algebraic counterpart of\n    a classical propositional logic, a polyadic algebra is the algebraic\n    counterpart of a classical first order logic without equality. A\n    variant of the polyadic algebra is what is known as a cylindric\n    algebra, which algebratizes a classical first order logic with\n    equality.\n\n[8]{} P.
