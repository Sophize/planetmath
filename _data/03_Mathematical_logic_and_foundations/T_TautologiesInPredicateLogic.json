  "definition": "Let FO$(\\Sigma)$ be a first order language over signature $\\Sigma$.\nRecall that the axioms for FO$(\\Sigma)$ are (universal) generalizations\nof wff\u2019s belonging to one of the following six schemas:\n\n1.  $A\\to (B\\to A)$\n\n2.  $(A\\to (B\\to C)) \\to ((A\\to B)\\to (A\\to C))$\n\n3.  $\\neg \\neg A \\to A$\n\n4.  $\\forall x (A\\to B) \\to (\\forall x A \\to \\forall x B)$, where\n    $x\\in V$\n\n5.  $A\\to \\forall x A$, where $x\\in V$ is not free in $A$\n\n6.  $\\forall x A \\to A[a/x]$, where $x\\in V$, $a\\in V(\\Sigma)$, and $a$\n    is free for $x$ in $A$\n\nwhere $V$ is the set of variables and $V(\\Sigma)$ is the set of\nvariables and constants, with modus ponens as its rule of inference:\nfrom $A$ and $A\\to B$ we may infer $B$.\n\nThe first three axiom schemas and the modus ponens tell us that\npredicate logic is an extension of the propositional logic. On the other\nhand, we can also view predicate logic as a part of propositional logic\nif we treat all quantified formulas as atoms. This can be done precisely\nas follows:\n\nCall a wff of FO$(\\Sigma)$ *quasi-atom* if it is either atomic, or of\nthe form $\\forall x A$, where $A$ is a wff of FO$(\\Sigma)$. Let $\\Gamma$\nbe the set of all quasi-atoms of FO$(\\Sigma)$.\n\nEvery wff of FO$(\\Sigma)$ can be uniquely built up from $\\Gamma$ using\nonly logical connectives $\\to$ and $\\neg$.\n\nInduction on the complexity of wff. For any wff $A$ of FO$(\\Sigma)$, it\nhas one of the following forms: $B\\to C$, $\\neg B$, or $\\forall x B$,\nwhere $B,C$ are wff\u2019s. If $A$ were $B\\to C$ or $\\neg B$, by induction,\nsince $B$ and $C$ were in $\\Gamma$, $A$ is in $\\Gamma$ as a result. If\n$A$ were $\\forall x B$, then $A$ is quasi-atomic, and therefore in\n$\\Gamma$ by the definition of $\\Gamma$. Unique readability follows from\nthe unique readability of wff\u2019s of propositional logic.\n\nSince no quantifiers are involved in the built-up process, the language\nbased on $\\Gamma$ as the set of atoms can be considered as the language\nof propositional logic. Call this logic PL$(\\Gamma)$. So the atoms of\nPL$(\\Gamma)$ are precisely the quasi-atoms of FO$(\\Sigma)$.\n\n**Definition**. We call a wff of FO$(\\Sigma)$ a *tautology* if it is a\ntautology of PL$(\\Gamma)$ (via truth tables).\n\nIn FO$(\\Sigma)$, every tautology is a theorem, but not conversely.\n\nSuppose wff $A$ is a tautology in FO$(\\Sigma)$. Then it is a tautology\nin PL$(\\Gamma)$ by definition, and therefore a theorem in PL$(\\Gamma)$\nsince propositional logic is complete with respect to truth-value\nsemantics. If $A_1,\\ldot,A_n$ is a deduction of $A$ (with $A_n=A$), then\neach $A_i$ is either an axiom, or is obtained by an application of modus\nponens. If $A_i$ is an axiom (of PL$(\\Gamma)$), it is an instance of one\nof the first three axiom schemas of FO$(\\Sigma)$ above, which means that\n$A_i$ is an axiom of FO$(\\Sigma)$. Furthermore, since modus ponens is a\nrule of inference for FO$(\\Sigma)$, $A_1,\\ldots, A_n$ is a deduction of\n$A$ in FO$(\\Sigma)$, which means that $A$ is a theorem of FO$(\\Sigma)$.\n\nOn the other hand, any wff that is an instance of one of the last two\naxiom schemas of FO$(\\Sigma)$ is a theorem that is not a tautology. For\nexample, $\\forall x (x=y) \\to (z=y)$ is an instance of the fourth axiom\nschema, which takes the form $C\\to D$, where $C$ is a quasi-atom, and\n$D$ an atom, both of which are atoms of PL$(\\Gamma)$. Any\ntruth-valuation that takes $C$ to $1$ and $D$ to $0$, takes $C\\to D$ to\n$0$. Therefore, $\\forall x (x=y) \\to (z=y)$ is not a tautology.",
