  "definition": "First let\u2019s look at the most general definition.\n\nLet $G \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and let $\\varphi \\colon G \\to\n{\\mathbb{R}} \\cup \\{ - \\infty \\}$ be an upper semi-continuous function,\nthen $\\varphi$ is [*subharmonic*]{} if for every $x \\in G$ and $r > 0$\nsuch that $\\overline{B(x,r)} \\subset G$ (the closure of the open ball of\nradius $r$ around $x$ is still in $G$) and every real valued continuous\nfunction $h$ on $\\overline{B(x,r)}$ that is harmonic in $B(x,r)$ and\nsatisfies $\\varphi(x) \\leq h(x)$ for all $x \\in \\partial B(x,r)$\n(boundary of $B(x,r)$) we have that $\\varphi(x) \\leq h(x)$ holds for all\n$x \\in B(x,r)$.\n\nNote that by the above, the function which is identically $- \\infty$ is\nsubharmonic, but some authors exclude this function by definition. We\ncan define [*superharmonic*]{} functions in a similar fashion to get\nthat $\\varphi$ is superharmonic if and only if $-\\varphi$ is\nsubharmonic.\n\nIf we restrict our domain to the complex plane we can get the following\ndefinition.\n\nLet $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ be a region and let $\\varphi \\colon\nG \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be a continuous function. $\\varphi$ is said to be\n[*subharmonic*]{} if whenever $D(z,r) \\subset G$ (where $D(z,r)$ is a\nclosed disc around $z$ of radius $r$) we have\n$$\\varphi(z) \\leq \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\varphi(z+ r e^{i\\theta}) d\\theta ,$$\nand $\\varphi$ is said to be [*superharmonic*]{} if whenever\n$D(z,r) \\subset G$ we have\n$$\\varphi(z) \\geq \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\varphi(z+ r e^{i\\theta}) d\\theta .$$\n\nIntuitively what this means is that a subharmonic function is at any\npoint no greater than the average of the values in a circle around that\npoint. This implies that a non-constant subharmonic function does not\nachieve its maximum in a region $G$ (it would achieve it at the boundary\nif it is continuous there). Similarly for a superharmonic function, but\nthen a non-constant superharmonic function does not achieve its minumum\nin $G$. It is also easy to see that $\\varphi$ is subharmonic if and only\nif $-\\varphi$ is superharmonic.\n\nNote that when equality always holds in the above equation then\n$\\varphi$ would in fact be a harmonic function. That is, when $\\varphi$\nis both subharmonic and superharmonic, then $\\varphi$ is harmonic.\n\nIt is possible to relax the continuity statement above to take $\\varphi$\nonly upper semi-continuous in the subharmonic case and lower\nsemi-continuous in the superharmonic case. The integral will then\nhowever need to be the rather than the Riemann integral which may not be\ndefined for such a function. Another thing to note here is that we may\ntake ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ instead of ${\\mathbb{C}}$ since we never did use\ncomplex multiplication. In that case however we must rewrite the\nexpression $z + r e^{i\\theta}$ in of the real and imaginary parts to get\nan expression in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$.\n\nIt is also possible generalize the range of the functions as well. A\nsubharmonic function could have a range of\n${\\mathbb{R}} \\cup \\{ -\\infty \\}$ and a superharmonic function could\nhave a range of ${\\mathbb{R}} \\cup \\{ \\infty \\}$. With this\ngeneralization, if $f$ is a holomorphic function then\n$\\varphi(z) := \\log \\lvert f(z) \\rvert$ is a subharmonic function if we\ndefine the value of $\\varphi(z)$ at the zeros of $f$ as $-\\infty$. Again\nit is important to note that with this generalization we again must use\nthe Lebesgue integral.\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B. Conway. [**]{}. Springer-Verlag, New York, New York, 1978.\nSteven\u00a0G.
