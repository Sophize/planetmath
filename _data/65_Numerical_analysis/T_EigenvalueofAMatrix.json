  "definition": "### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nLet $A$ be an complex $n \\times n$ matrix. A number\n$\\lambda \\in {\\mathbb{C}}$ is said to be an *eigenvalue* of $A$ if there\nis a nonzero $n \\times 1$ column vector $x$ for which\n$$A x = \\lambda x.$$\n\n### Computation of Eigenvalues {#computation-of-eigenvalues .unnumbered}\n\nThe computation of the eigenvalues of a given matrix $A$ is relatively\neasy from a theoretical point of view, though often computationally\ninfeasible, or at least difficult. The basic procedure is to note that\nthe eigenvalues of a matrix are precisely the solutions to the equation\n\n$$\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0.$$ where $I$ denotes the $n \\times n$ identity\nmatrix and $\\det$ is the determinant function. As the above determinant\nis simply a polynomial (of degree $n$, called the characteristic\npolynomial of $A$) in $\\lambda$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{C}$, its\nroots can be calculated or approximated accordingly to give the\neigenvalues of the matrix. Following this train of thought, we also note\nthat this polynomial has degree at least 1, so since $\\mathbb{C}$ is\nalgebraically closed, it is thus guaranteed that any $A$ has at least\none eigenvalue (and at most $n$). If $\\lambda$ is a multiple root (say,\nof multiplicity $k$) of the defining polynomial, we say that $\\lambda$\nis an *eigenvalue of multiplicity $k$*.\n\nIf one is given a $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ of real numbers, the above\nargument implies that $A$ has at least one complex eigenvalue; the\nquestion of whether or not $A$ has real eigenvalues is more subtle since\nthere is no real-numbers analogue of the fundamental theorem of algebra.\nIt should not be a surprise then that some real matrices do not have\nreal eigenvalues. For example, let\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$ In this case\n$\\det(\\lambda I - A) = \\lambda^2 + 1$; clearly no real number $\\lambda$\n$\\lambda^2 + 1 = 0$; hence $A$ has no real eigenvalues (although $A$ has\ncomplex eigenvalues $i$ and $-i$).\n\nIf one converts the above into an algorithm for calculating the\neigenvalues of a matrix $A$, one is led to a two-step procedure:\n\n-   Compute the polynomial $\\det(\\lambda I - A)$.\n\n-   Solve $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0$.\n\nUnfortunately, computing $n \\times n$ determinants and finding roots of\npolynomials of degree $n$ are both computationally messy procedures for\neven moderately large $n$, so for most practical purposes variations on\nthis naive are needed. See the eigenvalue problem for more .\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n-   $A$ and $A^T$ have the same eigenvalues.\n\n-   Eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are real.\n\n-   Eigenvalues of skew-symmetric are purely imaginary (or zero).\n\n-   A real matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if all of $A$\u2019s eigenvalues are\n    real and distinct.\n\n-   If a symmetric matrix has distinct eigenvalues, it is\n    diagonalizable.",
