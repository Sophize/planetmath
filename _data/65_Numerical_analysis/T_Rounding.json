  "definition": "*Rounding* is a general technique for approximating a real number by a\ndecimal fraction. There are several ways of rounding a real number, five\nof which are the most common: *rounding up*, *rounding down*,\n*truncation*, *ordinary rounding* (or *rounding* for short), and\n*banker\u2019s rounding*.\n\n### Rounding to an Integer {#rounding-to-an-integer .unnumbered}\n\nThe simplest kind of rounding is that of rounding a real number to an\ninteger. Let $r$ be a real number. Then\n\nrounding up:\n\n:   rounding up of $r$ is taking the smallest integer that is greater\n    than or equal to $r$. This integer is denoted by the ceiling\n    function\n    $$\\lceil r \\rceil:=\\min\\lbrace n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\mid n\\ge r \\rbrace.$$\n    Examples: $\\lceil 2.1 \\rceil = 3$, and $\\lceil 62.672 \\rceil=63$.\n\nrounding down:\n\n:   rounding down of $r$ is taking the largest integer that is less than\n    or equal to $r$. This integer is denoted by the floor function\n    $$\\lfloor r \\rfloor:=\\max\\lbrace n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\mid n\\le r\\rbrace = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\lceil r \\rceil & \\textrm{if $r$ is an integer}\\\\\n    \\lceil r\\rceil - 1 & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ Examples: $\\lfloor 1.24 \\rfloor = 1$, and\n    $\\lfloor -2.63 \\rfloor = -3$.\n\ntruncation:\n\n:   rounding by truncation is done by ignoring all decimals to the right\n    of the decimal point, which is equivalent to taking only the integer\n    part of $r$. The truncation of $r$ is denoted by $[r]$. In terms of\n    rounding up and rounding down: we have $$[r] = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\lfloor r \\rfloor & \\textrm{if $r\\ge 0$}\\\\\n    \\lceil r \\rceil & \\textrm{if $r< 0.$}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ If we write $r$ as a decimal number using decimal\n    expansion, then $[r]$ is the integral portion of $r$.\n\n    Examples: $[2.354]=2$, and $[-81.67]=-81$.\n\nordinary rounding:\n\n:   this is the most commonly used of the rounding methods described so\n    far. (Ordinary) rounding of $r$ is finding the closest integer to\n    $r$, and if $r$ is exactly half way between two integers, use the\n    larger of the two as the result. Let $R(r)$ represents the ordinary\n    rounding of $r$. It is easy to see that\n    $$R(r)=\\lfloor r+0.5 \\rfloor.$$ Examples: $R(-3.37)=-3$, while\n    $R(7.5)=8$.\n\n    There is an easy algorithm of rounding $r$ to the nearest integer.\n\n    1.  write $r$ as a decimal number using decimal expansion\n\n    2.  if the tenths decimal place value is less than $5$, then\n        $R(r)=[r]$\n\n    3.  if the tenths decimal place value is at least $5$, then\n        $R(r)=[r]+1$.\n\nbanker\u2019s rounding:\n\n:   a variant of the ordinary rounding is the banker\u2019s rounding: if $r$\n    is exactly half way between two integers, and the integer portion of\n    $r$ is even, round down $r$. Otherwise, use ordinary rounding on\n    $r$. If $B(r)$ denotes the banker\u2019s rounding of $r$, then it can be\n    defined as $$B(r) = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\lfloor r \\rfloor & \\textrm{if $[r]$ is even, and $2r\\in \\mathbb{Z}$}\\\\\n    R(r) & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ For example, $B(3.5)=4$, while $B(2.5)=2$.\n\nstochastic rounding:\n\n:   this rounding method requires the aid of a random number generator.\n    Rounding of $r$ may be done using any of the above methods when $r$\n    is not exactly half way between two consecutive integers. Otherwise,\n    $r$ is randomly rounded up or down based on the outcome of randomly\n    selecting a number between 0 and 1 using a random number generator.\n    The choice of rounding up (and thus down) depends on how numbers are\n    in $[0,1]$ are allocated for rounding up (or down).\n\nalternate rounding:\n\n:   this rounding method, like the last one, uses other available\n    methods except when the number in question $r$ is exactly half way\n    between two consecutive integers. However, this method is used in a\n    situation where a sequence of numbers needs to be rounded:\n\n    1.  the first number in the sequence is rounded using any of the\n        above methods;\n\n    2.  when the $n$-th number is rounded, the $(n+1)$-th number is\n        rounded as follows: if the number is exactly half way between\n        two consecutive integers, then it is rounded down if the $n$-th\n        number is rounded up, and vice versa. Otherwise, use the\n        rounding method used to round the first number in the sequence.\n\n### Rounding to a Decimal Fraction {#rounding-to-a-decimal-fraction .unnumbered}\n\nMore generally, the three methods described can be applied to rounding\nof $r$ to a decimal fraction. The general procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  First, specify how accurately we want to round $r$. This can be\n    accomplished by specifying to what decimal place we want to\n    approximate $r$. Let this place be $n$ (note that $n>0$ if it is to\n    the right of the decimal point and $n<0$ otherwise).\n\n2.  Write $r$ as a decimal number using decimal expansion.\n\n3.  Multiply $r$ by $10^n$. By doing this, we are basically moving the\n    decimal point so it is positioned between the $n$-th decimal place\n    and the $(n+1)$-th decimal place.\n\n4.  Use any of the four methods above to round $10^nr$.\n\n5.  Divide the rounded number by $10^n$ to get the result.\n\nIn practice, steps $3$ through $5$ can be combined into one step, simply\nby performing the rounding operation at the specified decimal place as\nif it were the ones place. For example, rounding $\\pi=3.14159...$ to the\nnearest thousandths place is $3.142$, the thousandths place value $1$ is\nincreased to $2$ because the ten thousandths place is $5$.\n\n**Remark**. In general, rounding to the $n$-th decimal place can be\nthought of as a function $f$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $D$, the set of all\ndecimal fractions, such that\n\n-   $|f(r)-r|\\le 10^n$, and\n\n-   $f(r)=r$ if $10^nr\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ denotes any of the four rounding methods\ndescribed in the previous section, and $g_n$ corresponds to rounding to\nthe $n$-th decimal place using method $g$ in step $4$ above, then the\nentire rounding process can be summarized by a single formula:\n$$g_n(r)=\\frac{g(10^n r)}{10^n}.$$",
