  "definition": "**Definition of $\\Delta$.**\n\nThe derivative of a function $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is defined\nto be the expression\n$$\\frac{df}{dx}:=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},$$ which makes sense\nwhenever $f$ is differentiable (at least at $x$). However, the\nexpression $$\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ makes sense even without $f$ being\ncontinuous, as long as $h\\neq 0$. The expression is called a *finite\ndifference*. The simplest case when $h=1$, written\n$$\\Delta f(x):=f(x+1)-f(x),$$ is called the *forward difference* of $f$.\nFor other non-zero $h$, we write\n$$\\Delta_h f(x):=\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ When $h=-1$, it is called a\n*backward difference* of $f$, sometimes written $\\nabla\nf(x):=\\Delta_{-1} f(x)$. Given a function $f(x)$ and a real number\n$h\\neq 0$, if we define $y=\\frac{x}{h}$ and $g(y)=\\frac{f(hy)}{h}$, then\nwe have $$\\Delta g(y)=\\Delta_h f(x).$$ Conversely, given $g(y)$ and\n$h\\neq 0$, we can find $f(x)$ such that $\\Delta g(y)=\\Delta_h f(x)$.\n\n**Some Properties of $\\Delta$.**\n\nIt is easy to see that the forward difference operator $\\Delta$ is\nlinear:\n\n1.  $\\Delta(f+g)=\\Delta(f)+\\Delta(g)$\n\n2.  $\\Delta(cf)=c\\Delta(f)$, where $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is a constant.\n\n$\\Delta$ also has the properties\n\n1.  $\\Delta(c)=0$ for any real-valued constant function $c$, and\n\n2.  $\\Delta(I)=1$ for the identity function $I(x)=x$. constant.\n\nThe behavior of $\\Delta$ in this respect is similar to that of the\nderivative operator. However, because the continuity of $f$ is not\nassumed, $\\Delta f=0$ does not imply that $f$ is a constant. $f$ is\nmerely a periodic function $f(x+1)=f(x)$. Other interesting properties\ninclude\n\n1.  $\\Delta a^x=(a-1)a^x$ for any real number $a$\n\n2.  $\\Delta x^{(n)}=nx^{(n-1)}$ where $x^{(n)}$ denotes the falling\n    factorial polynomial\n\n3.  $\\Delta b_n(x)=nx^{n-1}$, where $b_n(x)$ is the Bernoulli polynomial\n    of order $n$.\n\nFrom $\\Delta$, we can also form other operators. For example, we can\niteratively define $$\\begin{aligned}\n&&\\Delta^{1}f:=\\Delta f \\\\\n&&\\Delta^{k}f:=\\Delta(\\Delta^{k-1}f),\\quad\\mbox{where\n}k>1.\\end{aligned}$$ Of course, all of the above can be readily\ngeneralized to $\\Delta_h$. It is possible to show that $\\Delta_h f$ can\nbe written as a linear combination of\n$$\\Delta f,\\Delta^2 f,\\ldots,\\Delta^h f.$$\n\n**Difference Equation.**\n\nSuppose $F\\colon\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued function\nwhose domain is the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. A *difference\nequation* (in one variable $x$) is the equation of the form\n$$F(x,\\Delta_{h_1}^{k_1}f,\\Delta_{h_2}^{k_2}f,\\ldots,\\Delta_{h_n}^{k_n}f)=0,$$\nwhere $f:=f(x)$ is a one-dimensional real-valued function of $x$. When\n$h_i$ are all integers, the expression on the left hand side of the\ndifference equation can be re-written and simplified as\n$$G(x,f,\\Delta f,\\Delta^{2}f,\\ldots,\\Delta^{m}f)=0.$$ Difference\nequations are used in many problems in the real world, one example being\nin the study of traffic flow.",
