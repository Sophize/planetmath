  "definition": "Truly random numbers can only be generated by a physical process and\ncannot be generated via software. This makes it rather clumsy to use\nthem in Monte Carlo calculations, since they must be first generated in\na separate device and either sent to the computer or recorded (for\nexample on removable storage media) for later use in calculations.\nTraditionally, tapes containing millions of random numbers generated\nusing radioactive decay were available from laboratories.\n\nNowadays, standard digital computers often have provisions for obtaining\ntruly random numbers, that is, numbers generated by a physical process.\nFir instance, Intel has provided a since their $i810$ chipsets which\nutilizes noise in a particularly prone semiconductor as a source of\nrandomness. Often times it is possible to use other incidental physical\nnoise as a source; for example, static on the input channel of a sound\ncard. In addition, peripheral devices (add-ons) to personal computers\nexist which provide truly random numbers, when the previous methods\nfail.\n\n[3]{}\n\n(Derived from) The Data Analysis Briefbook. .",
