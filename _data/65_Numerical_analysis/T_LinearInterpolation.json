  "definition": "Among the many interpolation techniques that are available, *linear\ninterpolation* is one of the easiest to understand and implement, as the\ninterpolating function is pieced together by a series of line segments\nconnecting the breakpoints.\n\nSuppose we have a finite set $S$ of ordered pairs\n$(x_1,y_1),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ of real numbers such that\n$x_1<x_2<\\cdots <x_n$. The *linear interpolation function* of $S$ is a\nreal-valued function $f$ defined on $[x_1,x_n]$ such that, for\n$i=1,\\ldots,n-1$,\n$$f(x)=y_i + m_i (x-x_i),\\quad\\mbox{ where }m_i=\\frac{y_{i+1}-y_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\\mbox{ and }x\\in [x_i,x_{i+1}].$$\nIn other words, $f$ is a piecewise linear function such that $f$ is\nlinear in each of the interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ for $i=1,\\ldots,n-1$.\nWhen the points (in $S$) belong to the graph of a function $g$ defined\non a subset of $[x_1,x_n]$, we say that $f$ interpolates $g$. We also\nsay that $f$ interpolates $S$, as $S$ can be viewed as the graph of the\nfunction $g_S$ defined on $\\lbrace x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\rbrace$ such that\n$g_S(x_i)=y_i$.\n\nVisually, the interpolation function can be constructed by line segments\nwhose end points are pairs of points $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$\nfor each $i=1,\\ldots,n-1$. The follow graph shows the linear\ninterpolation function $f$ (in blue) of a set consisting of seven points\n(in dark green). Note that $f$ interpolates any function $g$ defined on\na subset of $[x_1,x_n]$ such that $g(x_i)=y_i$.\n\n(-7,-1.5)(7,3.5) (-7,0)[.]{} (7,0)[.]{} (3,-1)[.]{} (-3.7,3.1)[.]{}\n(-2,0)(-7,-1.5)(7,3.5) (-6,1)(-4,3)(-3,3)(0,0.5)(1,1)(3,-1)(6,2)\n(6.74,-0.4)[$x$]{} (-1.75,3.2)[$y$]{} (4.75,-1) (4.5,1)\n(-6,1)(-4,3)(-3,3)(0,0.5)(1,1)(3,-1)(6,2)\n(-6,1)(-4,3)(-3,3)(0,0.5)(1,1)(3,-1)(6,2)\n\n**Example.** Interpolate $\\lbrace (4,7),(2,3),(6,1)\\rbrace$ using linear\ninterpolation.\n\nArrange the points so the $x$-coordinates are in the ascending order.\nThere are two line segments associated with these three points: $\\ell_1$\nwith end points $(2,3),(4,7)$ and $\\ell_2$ with end points\n$(4,7),(6,1)$.
