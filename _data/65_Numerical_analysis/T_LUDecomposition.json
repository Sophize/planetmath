  "definition": "Let $A$ be an $n\\times m$ matrix. An LU decomposition (sometimes also\ncalled an LU factorization) of $A$, if it exists, is an $n\\times n$ unit\nlower triangular matrix $L$ and an $n\\times m$ matrix U, in (upper)\nechelon form, such that $$A = LU$$\n\nThe LU factorization is closely related to the row reduction algorithm.\nIn a very real sense, the factorization is a record of the steps taken\nin row reducing a matrix to echelon form. The matrix $L$ \u201cencodes\u201d the\nsequence of row replacement operations that row reduce the given matrix\n$A$ to echelon form $U$.\n\nSuppose that $A=LU$ is an LU factorization, and let $L_{ij}$ denote the\nentries of $L$. Then, the row reduction\n$A\\stackrel{\\rho}{\\Longrightarrow} U$ is accomplished by the following\nsequence $\\rho$ of $\\tfrac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ row replacement operations:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\hskip 2em & {\\mathrm{row}}_j \\mapsto  {\\mathrm{row}}_j-L_{j1}\\; {\\mathrm{row}}_1,\\quad\n    j=2,\\ldots, n;\\\\ \n     & {\\mathrm{row}}_j \\mapsto  {\\mathrm{row}}_j-L_{j2}\\; {\\mathrm{row}}_2,\\quad j=3,\\ldots, n;\\\\\n    & \\hskip  3em \\vdots \\\\\n    & {\\mathrm{row}}_j \\mapsto  {\\mathrm{row}}_j-L_{jk}\\; {\\mathrm{row}}_k,\\quad j=k+1,\\ldots,\n    n,\\quad k=1,\\ldots,n-1 \\\\  \n    & \\hskip 3em \\vdots \n  \\end{aligned}$$\n\nNote: the first $n-1$ steps clear out column $1$, the next $n-2$ steps\nclear out column $2$, etc.\n\nNot every matrix admits an LU factorization. Indeed, an LU factorization\nexists if and only if $A$ can be reduced to echelon without using row\nexchange operations. However, if an LU factorization exists, then it is\nunique.\n\nIn the most general case, one has to employ row exchange operations.\n\nLet $A$ be an $n\\times m$ matrix. Then, there exists an $n\\times n$\npermutation matrix $P$ (indeed, many such) such that the matrix $PA$\nadmits an LU factorization, i.e., there exist matrices $P, L, U$ such\nthat $$PA=LU.$$\n\nThe key idea behind LU factorization is that one does not need to employ\nrow scalings to do row reduction until the second half (the\nback-substitution phase) of the algorithm. This has significant\nimplication for numerical stability of the algorithm.\n\nThe LU decomposition of a given matrix $A$ is useful for the solution of\nthe systems of linear equations of the form $Ax = b$. Indeed, it\nsuffices to first solve the linear system $Ly=b$, and second, to solve\nthe system $Ux=y$. This two-step procedure is easy to implement, because\nowing to the lower and upper-triangular nature of the matrices $L$ and\n$U$, the required row operations are determined, more or less, directly\nfrom the entries of $L$ and $U$. Indeed, the first step,\n$$[\\, L\\; b\\, ] \\stackrel{\\rho_1}{\\Longrightarrow}  [\\, I \\; y \\,]$$ a\nsequence of row operations $\\rho_1$, and the second step\n$$[\\, U\\; y\\, ] \\stackrel{\\rho_2}{\\Longrightarrow}  [\\, E \\; x_0 \\,]$$ a\nsequence of row operations $\\rho_2$, are exactly the same row operations\none has to perform to row reduce $A$ directly to reduced echelon form\n$E$: $$[\\, A\\; b\\, ] \\stackrel{\\rho_1}{\\Longrightarrow} [\\, U\\; y \\, ] \n\\stackrel{\\rho_2}{\\Longrightarrow} [\\, E\\; x_0 \\, ] .$$ Note: $x_0$ is\nthe particular solution of $Ax=b$ that sits in the rightmost colulmn of\nthe augmented matrix at the termination of the row-reduction algorithm.",
