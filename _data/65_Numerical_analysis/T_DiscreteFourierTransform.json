  "definition": "The *discrete Fourier transform (DFT)* is an invertible transform widely\nemployed in signal processing and analysis. It can be computed using\nstable efficient algorithms known as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nalgorithms.\n\nDefinition\n==========\n\nGiven a sequence $\\{f_n\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ of $N$ complex numbers, the DFT\nis defined as a sequence $\\{F_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ of $N$ complex numbers\naccording to the equation\n\n$$F_k = \\frac{1}{N^{(1-p)/2}} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f_n\\,W_N^{-k,n}\\quad \\quad k=0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$$\n\nwhere $W_N^{k,n}=e^{2\\pi i q k n/N}$ are the basis functions, $p$ is an\narbitrary real number and $q$ is either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nSimilarly, we can reconstruct $\\{f_n\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ from\n$\\{F_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ via the *inverse discrete Fourier transform\n(IDFT)*:\n\n$$f_n = \\frac{1}{N^{(1+p)/2}} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} F_k\\,W_N^{k,n}\\quad \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$$\n\nExplanation\n===========\n\nGenerically, if we have some vector\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots , v_n)$ that we wish to\nproject on to a set of unit basis vectors\n${ {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{B}}}}_1, {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{B}}}}_2, \\dots , {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{B}}}}_m }$,\nwe find that the $k$th component of the projection\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}}'$ is given by\n$$v_k' = \\langle {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}}, {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{B}}}}_k \\rangle$$\nwhere\n$\\langle {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{u}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}} \\rangle$ is\nan inner product. Using the standard dot product of complex vectors, we\nhave $$v_k' = \\sum_{j=0}^m v_j\\bar{B}_{k,j}$$ (where $\\bar{z}$\nrepresents the complex conjugate of $z$).\n\nWe may use a procedure to project a function onto basis functions. Here,\nthe components of our vectors are the functions sampled at certain time\nintervals.\n\nThe idea of the Fourier transform is to project our discrete function\n$\\{f_n\\}$ onto a basis made up of sinusoidal functions of varying\nfrequency.\n\nWe know from Euler\u2019s relation that $$e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x$$ so we\ncan construct a sinusoidal function of any frequency $k$:\n$$W_N^{k,n} = e^{2\\pi i q k n/N} = \\cos (2\\pi i q k n/N) + i\\sin(2\\pi i q k n/N)$$\n\nBy Nyquist\u2019s theorem, any frequency components of $\\{f_n\\}$ above the\nNyquist frequency $\\frac{N}{2}$ will be aliased into lower frequencies,\nso we will only concern ourselves with the frequency components\n$\\frac{-N}{2} \\leq k \\leq \\frac{N}{2}$.\n\nNow we substitute these results into the standard formula for projection\nto reveal that\n\n$$F_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f_n\\,W_N^{-k,n}\\quad \\quad k=0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$$\n\nGroup theoretic interpretation and generalization\n=================================================\n\nThis procedure may be interpreted in terms of group theory as follows:\nThe basis functions $\\chi_k (j) e^{-2\\pi \\nu_k i j / f}$ are the\ncharacters of the irreducible representations of the group\n$\\mathbb{Z}_M$. The orthogonality relation\n$\\langle \\chi_m, \\chi_n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$ which was used to obtain\nthe transform as a projection is the orthogonality relation for\ncharacters.\n\nOnce we view the discrete Fourier transform in this fashion, it is not\nhard to generalize it by replacing $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ with any discrete\ngroup $G$. As it turns out, there are two versions of the generalization\nwhich turn out to coincide exactly in the case of commutative groups\n(such as $\\mathbb{Z}_M$).\n\nFirst generalization: Let $f \\colon G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ be conjugation\ninvariant, which means that, for every $y \\in G$, it is the case that\n$f(yxy^{-1}) = f(x)$. Then one has\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_k \\frac{1}{d_k} \\langle f, \\chi_k \\rangle \\chi_k (x)$$\n\nwhere the index $k$ runs over all irreducible representations and $d_k$\nis the dimension of the representation $k$. The inner product on vectors\nis the usual one:\n\n$$\\langle {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{u}}}, {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}} \\rangle = \\sum_{g \\in G} {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{u}}} (g) \\bar{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}}} (g)$$\n\nThe justification for this comes from the fact that the set of\nirreducible characters spans the space of conjugation invariant\nfunctions and the orthogonality of these characters.\n\nSecond generalization: If $f \\colon G \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is any function on\na group (not necessarily conjugation invariant), then we have the\ntransform\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_k \\sum_{i,j = 1}^{d_k} \\langle f, \\rho^{k}_{mn} \\rangle \\rho^{k}_{mn} (x)$$\n\nwhere $k$ and $d_k$ are as before and $\\rho^k_{mn}$ are the matrix\nelements of the representation $k$. The justification for this comes\nfrom the fact that the set of matrix elements of representations spans\nthe space of functions on the group and the orthogonality relation for\nmatrix elements.\n\n**Remarks:** DFT is also generalized by two-dimensional Fourier\ntransforms (2D-FT), Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, and via groupoid\nrepresentation to anharmonic analysis that can also be numerically\ncomputed by utilizing FFT, but tend to be very much slower that the\none-dimensional FFT because many series of sequential one-dimensional\nFFTs and also additional matrix transformations are involved in 2D-FT,\nor 2D-FFT.\n\n[**References:**]{} Paul Bourke,",
