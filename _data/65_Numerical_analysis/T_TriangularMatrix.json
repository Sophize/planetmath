Note that some matrices, such as the identity\nmatrix, are both upper and lower triangular. A matrix is upper and lower\ntriangular simultaneously if and only if it is a diagonal matrix.\n\nTriangular matrices allow numerous algorithmic shortcuts in many\nsituations. For example, if $A$ is an $n\\times n$ triangular matrix, the\nequation $Ax=b$ can be solved for $x$ in at most $n^2$ operations.\n\nIn fact, triangular matrices are so useful that much computational\nlinear algebra begins with factoring (or decomposing) a general matrix\nor matrices into triangular form. Some matrix factorization methods are\nthe Cholesky factorization and the LU-factorization. Even including the\nfactorization step, enough later operations are typically avoided to\nyield an overall time savings.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\nTriangular matrices have the following properties ( \u201ctriangular\u201d with\neither \u201cupper\u201d or \u201clower\u201d uniformly):\n\n-   The inverse of a triangular matrix is a triangular matrix.\n\n-   The product of two triangular matrices is a triangular matrix.\n\n-   The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the\n    diagonal elements.\n\n-   The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the diagonal elements.\n\nThe last two properties follow easily from the cofactor expansion of the\ntriangular matrix.",
