  "definition": "A [*scientific calculator*]{} is a calculator with all the arithmetic\ncapabilities of a basic calculator plus trigonometric, statistical,\nlogarithmic, binary logic, etc. which are useful in various scientific\napplications. A typical scientific calculator has some forty to fifty\nkeys and is capable of performing about twice as many operations than\nthat (necessitating a \u201cShift\u201d or \u201c2nd\u201d key). They are often capable of\ndisplaying results in binary, octal and hexadecimal, but are usually\nlimited to integers in those bases.\n\nThe calculator trigonometric functions are $\\sin$, $\\cos$, and $\\tan$,\nwhich have their own keys. The arc versions of these are usually\nobtainable by using the \u201cShift\u201d or \u201c2nd\u201d key.\n\nA scientific calculator may have a single memory register with the\nassociated keys M+, MR and MC, but they often have several more\nregisters to hold various values for use in statistical computations.\n\nFor values greater than about $10^{12}$ or smaller than $10^{-12}$\n(slightly more or less depending on the model) hardware scientific\ncalculators must switch to scientific notation.",
