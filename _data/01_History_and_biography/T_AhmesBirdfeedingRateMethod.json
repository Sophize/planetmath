  "definition": "STATEMENT\n\nIn 1927 reported additive aspects of three Egyptian Middle Kingdom\nbird-feeding rates. Chace\u2019s one part analysis unfairly introduced an\nincomplete two-part Middle Kingdom hekat weights and measures proposal.\n\nThe hekat was about five gallons in modern units. The hekat system was\napplied in the 1650 BCE Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP) over 60 times\nin 10 problems. In RMP \\#83, the bird-feeding problem, grain units were\nmeasured by 1/6, 1/20 and 1/40 portions of a hekat that fed seven birds\nby an unknown formula. Chace did not decode the complete formula.\n\nThe complete formula, decoded in 2006, included an initial hekat unity\n(64/64) system and multiplicative steps that parsed (64/64) by 1/6, 1/20\nand 1/40. The scribe reported three exact two-part quotient and scaled\nremainder rates:\n\n1\\. 2 geese, and a crane each ate (1/8 + 1/32) hekat + (3 + 1/3) ro\n\n2\\. a set-duck ate (1/32 + 1/64) hekat + 1 ro and,\n\n3\\. a set-goose, dove, and quail each at (1/64) hekat + 3 ro\n\nAhmes, the scribe, asked how much grain did the seven birds eat in one\nday? Additionally, three other questions asked: how much grain was eaten\nin 10 days, 20 days and 30 days ob the seven birds?\n\nThe scribal commodity purpose for the three bird-feeding rates had been\noutlined by 200 and 300 year older texts. The 200 year older text was\n(KP). The KP data computed relative values of 12 fowls brought to the MK\ncommodity market in Middle Kingdom in set-duck units:\n\na\\. 3 re-geese unit value 8 set-ducks = 24\n\nb\\. 3 terp-geese unit value 4 set-ducks = 12\n\nc\\. 3 Dj. Cranes unit value 2 set-ducks = 6\n\nd\\. 3 set-duck unit value 1 set-duck = 3\n\ntotal value 45 set-ducks.\n\nTo decode one day of grain eaten by seven birds in historical context,\nAhmes\u2019 intermediate hekat unity and 1/6, 1/20 and 1/40 portions are\nneeded. Given that Ahmes omitted initial and intermediate steps a 300\nyear older Akhmim Wooden Tablet (AWT) was consulted. The AWT scribe\nmultiplied the (64/64) unity by 1/3, 1/7, 1/10, 1/11 and 1/13 in steps\nthat were missing in the RMP. The AWT scribe returned the same class of\ntwo-part hekat quotients and 1/320 of a hekat scaled remainders as the\nRMP.\n\nIn 2002 Hana Vyzamalova, a Charles U., Prague graduate student, wrote a\npaper on the AWT that opened a long closed (64/64) hekat unity door.\nVymazalova showed that (64/64) was multiplied by 1/3, 1/7, 1/10, 1/11\nand 1/13 and reported two-part answers, that include five proofs that\nmultiplied by 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13, respectively, (64/64). But what were\nthe intermediate steps that preceded the two-part quotient and remainder\nanswers?\n\nAhmes only reported 1/6 of a hekat (three times), 1/20 of a hekat (once)\nand and 1/40 of a hekat (three times). One set of missing intermediate\nsteps included:\n\n1\\. (3/6 + 1/20 + 3/40)hekat\n\n2\\. (20 + 2 + 3)/40 hekat\n\n3.(25/40)hekat = (5/8) hekat (of grain)\n\nwere eaten by the seven birds in one day.\n\nThe 10 day answer was 50/8 = 6 1/4 hekat.\n\nThe 20 day answer was 12 1/2 hekat.\n\nThe 30 day, and commodity value of the seven fowls was 18 3/4 hekat.\n\nHad Ahmes\u2019 shorthand included AWT intermediate and proof steps, Chace\u2019s\nscholarly error may not have taken place.\n\nConclusion: Ahmes\u2019 shorthand calculations must be modified to include\nAWT scribal longhand and proof.\n\nCONTEXTUAL PROOF CONSIDERATIONS\n\nA. Ahmes also discussed theoretical aspects of the bird-feeding method\nin RMP 47. The details of RMP 47 discussed (6400/64) that scaled 100\nhekat within 100-quadruple and 400-quadruple in 10 two-part statements.\nThe 100-hekat calculations reported 100 hekat such that (6400/64)/n\nbegan the calculation rather than (64/64)/n began hekat divisions\nrecorded in RMP 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46. The 100-quadruple hekat and\n400-quadruple RMP 47 narrative offered raw data calculations that\nconfused additive math historians like A.B. Chace.\n\nHistorical bird-feeding rates problems requested by Ahmes first\nconsidered (64/64)/n and (6400/64)/n. Scribal partitions of hekat\nunities included the pesu. The pesu was an inverse proportion that\nvalued geese, crane, set-ducks and other fowls detailed in the RMP and\nthe Kahun Papyrus (KP) for use in commodities payments as wages to\nworkers.\n\nThe KP showed 200 years before the RMP that scribes easily calculated\nprices of birds scaled as commodities. The bird commodities were used as\nwage payments based on pesu inverse proportions of grain eaten by birds\nover 30 day standardized \u2019feeding periods\u2019.\n\nB. The was written around 1925 BCE. The scribe scaled a a volume unit\n(hekat) equivalent to 4800 ccm in modern metrics to (64/64) before\nsub-dividing to two-part units in the 1650 BCE Rhind Mathematical\nPapryus(RMP). The hekat unity (64/64) was multiplied by 1/3, 1/7, 1/10,\n1/11 and 1/13 in the AWT. The scaled hekat unity method recorded five\ntwo-part binary quotient (Q) and 1/320 of a hekat remainders (R) before\nfive proofs returns two-part answers to (64/64) that Ahmes, the RMP\nscribe, used over 60 times.\n\nSeen in a modern context the scribal two-part units reported\n\n1\\. \\[(64/64) times 1/n\\] = \\[Q/64 hekat + (5R/n times 1/320 of hekat\\]\n\nand\n\n2\\. \\[(64/64)/n\\] = \\[Q/64 + 5R/n times ro\\]\n\nThe word ro meant 1/320 of a hekat\n\nA two- part hekat-ro proof was published by Hana Vymazalova in 2002.\nVymazalova did not fully report the the scribal partitioning method.\nVymazalova cited without demonstrating that the (64/64) hekat unity\nmethod calculated five binary quotients (Q/64) and five (5R/n\\*ro)\nremainders in two-part answers. That is, the inverse initial divisors,\n3, 7, 10, 11 and 13 divided (64/64) such that five two-part answers were\nreported by Vymazalova without offering other scribal details.\n\nVymazalova\u2019s paper explicitly corrected Daressy\u2019s 1906 incomplete\nanalysis that had not fully parsed the scribal use of (64/64).\nVymazalova\u2019s corrections showed that all five 64/64 times 1/3, 1/7,\n1/10, 1/11 and 1/13 two-part answers were multiplied by 3, 7, 10, 11 and\n13, respectively, and returned 64/64.\n\nC. The (64/64) hekat partitioning method was used in the and the over 60\ntimes. Other aspects of the (64/64) hekat unity method have been\npublished in and .\n\nThe Kahun Papyrus(KP)reported bird valuations by taking pesu amounts of\ngrain consumed by set-ducks and other fowl in 30 days. The KP problem\nstressed 100-quadruple hekat, which meant greater than 4-hekat units.\nConverting 100 water fowls into groups of set-ducks a 1/20 of a hekat\nmeant the fowl ate 1/20 of a hekat every 30 day. The scaling method\nexposed a Middle Kingdom economic unit as well as a theoretical\nmathematical foundation.\n\nThe KP text ,for example, was transliterated by Griffith and published\nin . Clagett published a standard 1920s KP and RMP transliteration that\nimproperly suggests certain incomplete bits information were complete.\nComplete initial and intermediate calculation steps were omitted by the\nMiddle Kingdom scribes, a situation that Clagett and earlier\ntranscribers did not know how correct.\n\nTo achieve complete translations, muddled transliterations have been\ncorrected. The oldest text may be the 1950 BCE Akhmim Wooden Tablet\n(AWT). Hana Vymazalova began the correction process. Vymazalova proved\nan important aspect of AWT arithmetic in 2002. Ahmes bird-feeding method\nused the same arithmetic division aspect in 1650 BCE. The AWT and RMP\nscribes began with (64/64), a hekat unity, as Vymazalova showed by five\nproofs.\n\nVymazalova\u2019s hekat unity (64/64) set of five proofs opened an important\ndoor. The method solved one level of Ahmes\u2019 bird feeding rate problem,\nand like problems reported in the Kahun Papyrus(KP). Vymazalova\ncorrected Daressy\u2019s two 1906 \u201cerrors\u201d, divisor 11 and divisor 13 cases,\nand showed that all five divisions of hekat were proven by the initial\nhekat unity (64/64) were exactly returned five times.\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe AWT hekat unity proofs validated that an \u2019ab initio\u2019 encoded method\nwas also used by Ahmes 250 years later over 70 times. Ahmes, for\nexample, demonstrated that tghe multiplication by 1/6 of a hekat unity\nby writing:\n\nthe 1/6 portion of the hekat steps looked like this:\n\n(64/64) times 1/6 = 10/64 + 4/38\n\n(8 + 2)64 + (20/6)ro\n\nand rescaled the remainder 4/384 by (5/5) to 20/2220\n\nbut wrote (20/6)ro, since 1/320 was name ro that wrote (3 + 1/3)ro\n\nas the remainder of the final unit fraction two-part statement:\n\n(1/8 + 1/32)hekat + (3 + 1/3)ro\n\nThe non-additive aspects of the AWT and RMP division problems were\nparsed in a 2005 study and published in 2006. The study contrasted 40\nhekat volume unit measures and found a generalized quotient and\nremainder hekat unity division method that limited n to the range of\n1/64 &lt; n &lt; 64. The AWT and RMP method defined a hekat unity as\n(64/64) by Hana Vymazalova and her 2002 paper that divided the unity by\nseveral rational numbers n. Answers were written in binary quotients and\nscaled Egyptian fraction series when n was limited to the range 1/64\n&lt; n &lt; 64. Scribal divisor n values a quotient and remainder\nanswers were written (defining hekat subunits such that 10/n hin, 64/n\ndja (per Tanja Pemmerening\u2019s 2002 paper), and 320/n ro in the AWT, RMP,\nand the Ebers Papyrus.\n\nExact binary quotients and scaled ro remainders were used by Egyptian\nMiddle Kingdom from 2000 BCE to 1500 BCE. RMP 83 and a division of a\nhekat unity method was oddly discussed by Chace, concluding \u201c... the\nauthor (Ahmes) does not specify explicitly how he performed them\u201d. The\nbroader context of the Old Kingdom Horus-Eye aspect of Ahmes\u2019\nbird-feeding rate problem were jointly published in 2006 by Gardner,\nthat exposed Ahmes\u2019 thinking.\n\nTheoretically expected usage rates were calculated by Ahmes and Middle\nKingdom scribes to control major commodity inventories. Knowing expected\nusages allowed decentralized managers double checked actual inventory\nusages, calculating profits, losses, paying taxes, and creating\ncontracts of many types within a double entry accounting system.\nOverall, the economic context of Egyptian fractions contained\ntheoretical elements, one being Ahmes\u2019 bird-feeding rate division\nmethod. In total, innovative Egyptian fraction mathematics facilitated\ncentralized and decentralized business practices, including land rental\ncontracts operated by absentee landlords.\n\nWith bird valuations reported by:\n\nRMP 83 Ahmes considered RMP 83 within three Akhmim Wooden Tablet\ndivisions of (64/64)/n (n =10, 7 and 3) within a table of set-duck\n(rated at 1) valued at (1/32 + 1/64)hekat + 1 ro, which Ahmes recorded:\n\n3/64 + 4/(20\\*64) = (64/64)/20\n\nas well\n\n1/40 a hekat = 1/64 hekat + (1/2 + 1/10)ro\n\nWorking the Akhmim Wooden Tablet method in reverse order Ahmes published\nan abbreviated table of fowl valuations\\* based on a set-duck consuming\n1/20 of a hekat, compared to a small number of fowl consumption rates\nrated a 2, 4 and 8 times more valuable.\n\nAhmes\u2019 data compare binary quotients and scaled ro remainder information\nto RMP 47 data of the same type by:\n\nHekat/n recorded in binary quotients (hekat) and scaled ro remainders\n=====================================================================\n\na\\. 1/40 (64/64)/40 = 1/64 hekat + \\[24/40(64) = (120/40(ro)\\]\n\n1/64 hekat + 3 ro\n\nAhmes\u2019 set-goose, dove and quail hekat consumption rate\\*\n\nb\\. 1/20: (64/64)/20 = 3/64 + 20/20 ro =\n\n(2 + 1)/64 + ro\n\nAhmes\u2019 valuation of a set-duck\\*\n\nc\\. 1/16: (64/64)/16 = 4/64 = 1/16 hekat\n\n1/10: (64/64)/10 = 6/64 + 20/20 =\n\n\\[(4 + 2)/64 = 1/16 + 1/32\\] + 1 ro\n\n(an AWT number ... and a djendjen consumption rate\\*)\n\nd\\. 1/9: (64/64)/9 = 7/64 + 5/9 ro = ( 4 + 2 + 1)/64 + \\[5/9 = (10/18)ro\n= (9 + 1)/18)\\]\n\n(1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64)hekat + (1/2 + 1/18)ro\n\ne\\. 1/8: (64/64)/8 = 8/64 = 1/8 hekat\n\nf\\. 1/7: (64/64)/7 = 9/64 + 5/7 ro =\n\n(8 + 1)/64 + \\[(10/14)ro = (7 + 2 + 1) /14 ro\\] =\n\n(1/8 + 1/64)hekat + (1/2 + 1/7 + 1/14)ro\n\n(another AWT number)\n\ng\\. 1/6: (64/64)/6 = 10/64 + 20/6 ro =\n\n(8 + 2)/64 + (3 + 1/3)ro=\n\n1/8 + 1/32) hekat + (3 + 1/3)ro\n\nh\\. 1/5: (64/64)/5 = 12/64 + 20/6 ro =\n\n(8 + 4)/64 hekat + (3 + 1/3)ro\n\n(1/8 + 1/16)hekat + (3 + 1/3)ro\n\n(Ahmes\u2019 terp-goose hekat consumption rate\\*)\n\ni\\. 1/4: (64/64)/4 = 16/64 = 1/4 hekat\n\nj\\. 1/3: (64/64)/3 = 21/64 + 5/3 ro =\n\n(16 + 4 + 1)/64 + (1 + 2/3)ro =\n\n(1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 hekat + ( 3 + 2/3) ro\n\n(another AWT number)\n\nk\\. 1/(5/2): (64/64)/2 + (64/64)/8 =\n\n(1/2 + 1/8)hekat\n\n(Ahme\u2019 re-goose hekat consumption rate\\*)\n\nl\\. 1/2: (64/64)/2 = 32/64 = 1/2 hekat\n\nm\\. 1/1.

RMP 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 and 47 contained hieratic symbols\nfor 400-hekat and 100-hekat units that seemed interchangeable, but are\nnot.\n\nArchaeological studies fairly scale one hekat to 4800 ccm, 1/10 hekat\n(hin) to 480 ccm and 1/320 of a hekat (ro) to 15 ccm.\n\nAn unsolved aspect from RMP 47 mixed two 400-hekat multiplications (by\n1/10 and 1/20) found (10) 4-hekat and (5) 4-hekat, respectively, with\neight 100-hekat multiplications (by 1/30, 1/40, 1/50, 1/60, 1/70, 1/80,\n1/90 and 1/100) found 1-hekat quotients and 1-ro remainders. The scribal\nscaling method followed the AWT two-part number pattern, and two\n400-hekat multiplications (by 1/10 and 1/20) found 4-hekat quotients\n(4-ro remainders were not cited, but would have been required if 1/30\nwas the multiplier).\n\n[9]{}\n\nA.B.
