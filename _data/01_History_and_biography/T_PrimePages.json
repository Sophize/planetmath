  "definition": "[*The Prime Pages*]{} are described by their maintainer, Chris Caldwell,\nas \u201cThe \u2018Guinness book\u2019 of prime number records.\u201d They contain\ninformation on the largest known primes with subclassifications by kinds\nof primes (e.g., Sophie Germain primes, multifactorial primes, etc.)\n\nThe primes that the Prime Pages concern themselves are too large to\nwrite out in base 10. Even as a binary integer, the largest known\nMersenne prime would require a 32 megabyte file to contain it. Thus the\nprimes are written \u201cindirectly\u201d (e.g., $2^{32582657} - 1$ for the\nlargest known Mersenne prime).\n\nThe Prime Pages also serve as a clearinghouse of information on the\nlatest primality testing algorithms and programs.\n\nChris Caldwell teaches mathematics at the University of Tennessee at\nMartin.
