  "definition": "RMP 69 and the Berlin Papyrus: An Inverse Proportion Method\n\nThis entry outlines scribal shorthand data by translating raw unit\nfraction data into modern arithmetic. The scribal shorthand data was\nmade readable by adding back missing data. The restored info created\naccurate scribal longhand data recorded in modern arithmetic statements.\n\nThere are three reasons for modern students of Egyptian mathematics to\nstudy the 1650 BCE Rhind Mathematical Papyrus(RMP) problem 69. All three\nreasons solve two Berlin Papyrus second degree equations in scribal\nalgebra.\n\nTo outline the math shorthand used by Ahmes, the RMP scribe, a three\nphase proof will be analyzed.\n\n1\\. In RMP 69 Ahmes converted 3 1/2 hekats of grain that made 80 loaves\nof bread into a pesu unit. Scholars Schack-Schackenburg, early on,\ncommented on a proportion method that a scribe, and Ahmes, the RMP\nscribe, utilized as a common mathematical tool.\n\nInitially 3 1/2 hekats of grain meal, that produced 80 loaves of bread,\nwere combined into pesu units for distribution purposes. Ahmes\u2019 first\nphase calculated the pesu as a rational rational number by applying a\nproportion.\n\nAhmes conversion of 7/2 hekat, making 80 loaves of bread, to 22 18/21\npesu was achieved by inverting 7/2 to 2/7 and multiplying by 80,\nreporting:\n\n80 times 2/7 equaled (160/7) pesu and (22 + 2/3 + 1/7 + 1/21) pesu\n\nby applying the Old Kingdom duplation multiplication method.\n\nModern conversions of hekat, loaf, and pesu date to modern rational\nnumbers discussed the same proportion method used in the Berlin Papyrus.\nIn modern fractions the Berlin scribe found two squared areas, one 10\ncubit by 10 cubits, and the second 20 cubits by 20 cubits, by\nconsidering the proportions: 1: 3/4, and 2: 1/3.The two Berlin Papyrus\nproblems solved second degree equations\n\n2\\. Ahmes proved the answer by returning its pesu unit fractions to 80\nloaves of bread. This was done by:\n\n(22 + 18/21) pesu times 7/2 equals 80 loaves of bread,\n\nby applying the Old Kingdom duplation method.\n\n3\\. The second phase of Ahmes\u2019 discussion links two Berlin Papyrus\nsolutions to two squares equal to 100 and 400 cubits squared, with x\nproportional to y by 1: 3/4.\n\nGillings recorded the proportional relationship as\n\n4x + 3y = 0\n\nThe BP scribe avoided modern thinking by reducing:\n\na\\. 4x = 3y\n\nin the A = 100 problem to:\n\nb\\. x = (3/4)y\n\n. for the A = 400 problem considered\n\n2x = (3/2)y\n\nThe BP scribe proved that either x or 2x proportional solutions were\nvalid by applying the well known proportional method, a direct analogy\nto the pesu method.\n\n3\\. The third phase of RMP 69 multiplied 14 ro times 80 to shows that one\nloaf of bread\u2019s ro value was properly stated to 80 loaves in hekat\nunits. Ahmes did that when he wrote:\n\na\\. 14 ro as 1/32 hekat + 4 ro\n\nb\\. 28 ro as 1/16 1/64 hekat + 3 ro\n\nc\\. 56 ro as 1/8 1/32 1/64 hekat + 1ro\n\nd\\. 112 ro as 1/4 1/16 1/32 hekat + 2 ro\n\ne\\. 224 ro as 1/2 1/8 1/16 hekat + 4 ro\n\nf 448 ro as 1 1/4 1/8 1/64 hekat + 3 ro\n\ng\\. 896 ro as 2 1/2 1/4 1/32 hekat + 1 ro\n\nh\\. 1220 ro as 3 1/2 hekat\n\nThe above reports the shorthand data, Scholars have analyzed this data\nover the years.\n\nAspects of meta level were not reported until 2002.\n\nAfter 2002 the hekat unity (64/64) have been increasingly reported as\ndivisions by n in terms of\n\n(64/64)/n\n\na method reported in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet that set n = 3, 7, 10, 11\nand 13.\n\nWhat was n at every stage of the RMP 69 duplation proof?\n\nBegin with 14 ro = 14/320 = 7/160\n\nthat meant that multiplier 7/160 was understood by Ahmes to be the\ndivisor 160/7, or\n\na\\. n = 160/7\n\nb\\. n = 320/7\n\nc\\. n = 640/7\n\nd\\. n = 1280/7\n\ne\\. n = 2560/7\n\nf n = 5120/7\n\ng\\. n = 10240/7\n\nh\\. n = 12800/7\n\nCONCLUSION: Ahmes followed the 1825 BCE Akhmim Wooden Papyrus scribe and\nthe Berlin Paprus scribal methods that later solved RMP 69. The meta\nlevel of ancient math can be seen as reported expected (theoretical) and\nactual (practical) calculations, details that are reported in RMP 69,\nand the Berlin Papyrus. Middle Kingdom Egyptian scribes also scaled the\nhekat to 320 ro units, 1/320th of a hekat.",
