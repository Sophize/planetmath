  "definition": "From the Math history list:\n\nThe 1650 BCE Rhind Mathematical Papyrus reported RMP 47,82, and 83,\nthree of twelve RMP hekat (unity) division problems. The same class of\nRMP problem was recorded 250 years earlier in the Akhmim Wooden Table\n(AWT). The AWT scaled one hekat (4800 ccm in modern metrics) to (64/64)\nand divided the unity by n six times created quotients (Q)/64 and scaled\nremainders (5R/n)(1/320 of a hekat = ro) in two-part statements. In 2005\n42 hekat division of (64/64) problems were decoded in the two-part\npattern. The information was published in 2006. In 2010 ten RMP 47\n100-hekat problems were added that scaled 100-hekat to (6400/64) and\ndivided (6400)/64)/64 by n in the two-part pattern. Ahmes actually\nintroduced 400 hekat divided by by writing 4-(6400/64)/n = Q/64 +\n(5R/n)ro patterns.\n\nThe details of RMP 47 shows that Ahmes divided 100-hekat, written as\n(6400/64) by n in a manner that Griffith and Spalinger (1990) considered\nan open issue with respect to an alternate 400-hekat scaling. Ahmes, in\nmy view, scaled 100-hekat to (6400/64) and divided the hekat unity by n\n= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100, recording Q/64 + (5R/n)ro\nin encoded two-part answers ten times.\n\nFor example, in the n = 70 case Ahmes scaled the hekat quotient 91/64 to\na binary (Horus-Eye) series considering:\n\n(64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1)/64 = (1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64)hekat\n\nAhmes encoded the remainder 30/64 term by scaling by 5/5 obtaining 1/320\nro units such that\n\n(150/70)ro = \\[2 + \\[(1/7)(6/6)ro\\] = \\[2 + (6/42)ro\\] = \\[2+ (3 + 2 +\n1)/42\\]ro = \\[2 + 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42\\]ro\n\nAhmes encoded (6400/64)/70 answer reported the complete AWT two-part\nanswer by:\n\n(1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64)hekat + (2 + 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42)ro\n\nRobins-Shute reported an unclear aspect of Ahmes\u2019 hard-to-read RMP 47\nshorthand in 1987. Robins-Shute arithmetically found a correct answer,\n(2 + 1/7)ro. Robins-Shute seem to have garbled Ahmes\u2019 beginning and\nintermediate information by reporting Ahmes\u2019 remainder by not noticing\nAhmes\u2019 conversion of 1/7 to a unit fraction series that considered:\n\n1/7 = 6/42 = (3 + 2 + 1)/42 = 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42\n\nNote the same conversion method was used by Ahmes in the 2/n table that\nconverted 2/101 in the meta context:\n\n2/101 = (2/101)(6/6) = 12/606 = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/606 = 1/101 + 1/202 +\n1/303 + 1/606\n\nthe same method that an EMLR scribe used 250 years earlier that\nconverted 1/101 by:\n\n1/101 = (1/101)(6/6) = 6/606 = (3 + 2 + 1)/606 = 1/202 + 1/303 + 1/606\n\nRMP 82 listed 29 examples of one hekat scaled to (64/64), and divided by\nrational numbers n. The 29 divisors ranged from 1/64 &lt; n &lt; 64. The\n29 problems reported binary quotients and scaled remainders to a 1/320\nhekat unit as two-part answere that were preceded by ten RMP 47\nexamples.\n\nThe table of 29 answers also were converted to unscaled equivalent hin,\n1/10 of a hekat unit showing that Ahmes generally reported hin units by\nwriting 10/n hin statements.\n\nTanja Pemmerening pointed out corrected aspects of the unscaled 64/n dja\nand 320/n ro statements in 2002 and 2005.\n\nRMP 83, the bird-Feeding rate problem, was not correctly read by Chace,\nnor by other 20th century scholars. Today the 1900 BCE Akhmim Wooden\nTablet, and its six division problems, allows economic valuations of one\nhekat scaled to (64/64) divided by n. In RMP 83 divisors n equaled 6, 20\nand 40. Division took place by multiplying 1/6, 1/20 and 1/40. Ahmes\u2019\nanswer calculated 5/8 of a hekat, the amount of grain eaten by six birds\nin one day.\n\nAhmes usually began hekat division discussions with a complex example,\nand proceeded to simpler examples. An exception was RMP 35-38. RMP 35\nwas the simplest example. It is important to note Egyptian weights and\nmeasures are decoded by stripping away to reveal modern rational numbers\nand modern arithmetic operations.\n\nIn , hekat division replaced a hekat by 320 ro. Ahmes\u2019 unit fraction\nshorthand notations is translated to modern arithmetic as follows:\n\n1\\. 320 ro was multiplied by 3/10 = 96 ro (RMP 35)\n\nProof: 3/10 + 6/10 + 1/10 = 1, and 96 ro + 192 ro + 32 ro = 320 ro = 1\nhekat\n\n2\\. 320 ro was multiplied by 1/90 = 3 + 1/2 + 1/18 = 64/18 (RMP 37)\n\nProof: 64/72 + 64/567 = 1\n\n3\\. 320 ro was divided by 7/22 = 101 9/11 (RMP 38)\n\nwas proven by 101 9/11 times 22/7 = 320 ro\n\nIt may be interesting to note that the initial divisor 7/22 was proven\nfrom binary steps yielding 35/11 times 1/10.\n\n4\\. 10 hekats of fat, 3200 ro, was divided by 365 = 8 + 280/365 (RMP 66)\n\nwas proven by the quotient 8 created by the binary steps 1 - 365, 2 -\n730, 4 - 1460 and 8 - 2920 and the remainder 280 (3200 less 2920) by the\naddition of\n\n246 1/3 + 36 1/2 + 1/6 = 320 ro = 1 hekat\n\nsince the unit fractions contained in the answer (2/3 + 1/10 + 1/2190)\nwere each multiplied by 365.\n\nSummary: Egyptian volume weights and measures replaced a hekat by two\nequivalents, a unity (64/64), (6400/64), and 320 ro. Division of the\nhekat, be it (64/64)/n, (6400/64)/n and (320/320)/n Ahmes\u2019 division\ninformation anticipated modern multiplication and division as inverse\noperations.\n\nScribal methods for finding areas of triangles and other shapes are\nreported in confirms connections to 3,650 year old Egyptian weights and\nmeasures topics, and scribal arithmetic operations. For example, RMP 41,\n42, and 43 defined the volume of a hekat by a cylinder set pi = 256/81,\nand set a radius to semi-diameter (D/2), algebraic geometry facts and\nmethods also reported in MMP -10 and the Kahun Papyrus.\n\nFootnote:\n\nAspects of hekat calculations are reported in RMP 43 and the Kahun\nPapyrus where the volume formula\n\nV = (2/3)(H)\\[(4/3)(4/3)(D)(D)\\] (khar)\n\nScribes divided khar data by 20 to reach 400-hekat and 100-hekat units.\nRMP 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 mixed hieratic symbols for 400-hekat\nand 100-hekat, scribal facts cited on Wikipedia that muddle the ancient\ninformation per:\n\n\"Problem 47 gives a table with equivalent fractions for fractions of 100\nquadruple hekat of grain. The quotients are expressed in terms of Horus\neye fractions...\n\n1/10 gives 10 quadruple hekat, 1/20 gives 5 quadruple hekat, 1/30 gives\n3 1/4 1/16 1/64 (quadruple) hekat and (1 2/3 ro) (error), 1/40 gives 2\n1/2 (quadruple) hekat, 1/50 gives 2 (quadruple) hekat, 1/60 gives 1 1/2\n1/8 1/32 (quadruple) hekat (3 1/3) ro (error), 1/70 gives 1 1/4 1/8 1/32\n1/64 (quadruple) hekat (2 1/14 1/21) ro (error)\\*, 1/80 gives 1 1/4\n(quadruple) hekat, 1/90 gives 1 1/16 1/32 1/64 (quadruple) hekat 1/2\n1/18 ro (error), 1/100 gives 1 (quadruple) hekat (error).\n\n\\*Ahmes actually reported one (5R/n)ro remainder as 2 1/14 1/21 1/42\nsince (150/70)ro = (2 + 1/7)ro with 1/7 = 1/7(6/6) = 6/42 = (3 + 2 +\n1)/42 = 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42 (a 2/n table rule per 2/101, and an EMLR rule\nper 1/101).\n\nAhmes mixed initial 400-hekat multiplications by 1/10 and 1/20 reporting\ncorrect answers with 100-hekat (scaled to 6400/64) multiplications by\n1/30, 1/40, 1/50, 1/60, 1/70, 1/80, 1/90 and 1/100 into Q/64 quotient\nand (5R/n) remainders report incorrect answers whenever 4-hekat\nquotients are added to 1-ro remainders. Correctly scaled RMP 47 answers\nreport one of two mutually exclusive sets of balanced statements:\n\nA. Table A reports 4-hekat quotient + 4-ro remainder answers:\n\nfollowing 4 x (6400/64) x 1/n = (Q/64) 4-hekat + (5R/n)4-ro\n\n1/10 gives (10) 4-hekat, 1/20 gives (5) 4-hekat, 1/30 gives (3 1/4 1/16\n1/64) 4-hekat + (1 2/3)4-ro, 1/40 gives (2 1/2) 4-hekat, 1/50 gives (2)\n4-hekat, 1/60 gives (1 1/2 1/8 1/32) 4-hekat + (3 1/3)4-ro, 1/70 gives\n(1 1/4 1/8 1/32 1/64) 4-hekat + (2 1/14 1/21 1/42) 4-ro, 1/80 gives (1\n1/4) 4-hekat, 1/90 gives (1 1/16 1/32 1/64) 4-hekat (1/2 1/18)4-ro,\n1/100 gives (1) 4-hekat,\n\nB. Table B reports with 1-hekat quotient + 1-ro remainder answers:\n\nfollowing 1 x (6400/64) x 1/n = (Q/64)1-hekat + (5R/n)1-ro\n\n1/10 gives (10) 1-hekat 1/20 gives (5) 1-hekat 1/30 gives (3 1/4 1/16\n1/64) 1-hekat + (1 2/3)1-ro 1/40 gives (2 1/2) 1-hekat 1/50 gives (2)\n1-hekat 1/60 gives (1 1/2 1/8 1/32) 1-hekat + (3 1/3)1-ro 1/70 gives (1\n1/4 1/8 1/32 1/64) 1-hekat + (2 1/14 1/21 1/42)1-ro 1/80 gives (1 1/4)\n1-hekat 1/90 gives (1 1/16 1/32 1/64) 1-hekat (1/2 1/18)1-ro 1/100 gives\n(1) 1-hekat\n\nC. The quadruple (400) hekat case is also made by 4-sack and 4-hekat\neconomic shipping units recorded in Northumberland Papyri 1, 2 and 3\npublished by Barns and Gunn, 1948. Quadruple sack and hekat initial\nscaled values were monitored into individual bread contents of 4 hekat\nunits of grain (and weights) thereby not mixing initial 4-hekat data\nwith final 1-hekat quotients, and 1-ro remainders. Balanced 4-hekat,\n4-ro or 1-hekat, 1-ro quotients and remainders was practiced by Ahmes.\nAhmes reported khar divided by 20 into 400 hekat units by two volume\nformulas. The 400 hekat and 100-hekat initial divisions byt rational\nnumbers have been translated into one hekat into 4800 ccm, 1/10 of a\nhekat (hin) into 480 ccm, 4-ro into 60 ccm, and 1-ro = 15 ccm by\nscholars, often muddling scribal 4-hekat and 4-ro intermediate details.\n\nOne study reviews Ahmes\u2019 quail, dove, duck and geese daily feeding rates\n(RMP 83) by testing Tanja Pemmerening\u2019s 2005 480 ccm 1/10 hekat (hin)\nvolume conclusion. Two duck and geese unaudited conclusions suggest a\nhin may have held about 250 ccm ... improved studies results are needed\nto introduce dove,quail, and other water fowl eating rates, hoping to\nfind a larger pattern. Two of three ancient geese mentioned by Ahmes are\nextinct, reducing the study\u2019s sample size.\n\n[10]{}\n\nA.B.
