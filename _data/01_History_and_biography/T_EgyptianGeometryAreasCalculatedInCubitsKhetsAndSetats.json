  "definition": "An Egyptian scribe, Ahmes, recorded length, width, area, height, and\nvolume calculations in the . Three problems outlined basic geometry\nunits as algebraic and finite. Length, width, area, height, and volume\nformulas stressed arithmetic quotient and remainders statements.\n\nVolume units were often limited to 1/64 of a hekat quotients statements.\nRemainders were expressed in 1/320 of a hekat (named ro) remainders such\nthat(1/64)(5/5) = 5/320 of a hekat) = 5 ro. At other times Ahmes\nrecorded hekat units only in terms of 1/320 quotient and remainder\nstatements.\n\nAhmes used 400 year old standardized quotient and remainder arithmetic.\nThe unit fraction system had been poorly decoded by 20th century\nscholars. By 2002 CE, scribal weights and measures revealed\n(1/30)cubit-cubit-cubit = (1/20)khar = 1 hekat and other ancient finite\nmath facts. Middle Kingdom scribes often replaced one hekat with (64/64)\nhekat, 10 hin, 64 dja, and 320 ro depending upon the application. The\n(64/64) hekat identity method may have first appeared in the 1900 BCE\nAkhmim Wooden Tablet. Hana Vymazalova first published the (64/64) hekat\nunity fact in 2002 CE.\n\nThe (64/64) hekat unity method was used over 60 times in the RMP and\nfive times in the 300 year older Akhmim Wooden Tablet using divisors n\nin the range 1/64 &lt; n &lt; 64.\n\nExact quotient and remainder statements were recorded in concise unit\nfraction series. Units fraction answers were sometimes proven by being\nmultiplied by initial divisors, and returned to unity. Five examples\nproofs appeared related to (64/64) being returned in the Akhmim Wooden\nTablet and (320 ro) was returned in RMP 38.\n\nThe Akhmim Wooden Tablet returned (64/64) validating five \u2019ab initia\u2019\n(64/64)/n using divisors n: 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13 calculating binary\nquotient (Q/64) and (5/5) scaled ro remainders, a method that Ahmes used\nto convert 7/9 hekat in RMP 43, line 5. The RMP included over 40\nexamples of the (64/64)/n hekat unity division method.\n\nRMP 38 used a related method. Ahmes multiplied 320 ro by 7/22 and\nobtained (101 + 9/11)ro. A proof multiplied (101 + 9/11)ro by 22/7 and\nreturned. 320 ro. The proof documents that scribal division was inverse\nto scribal multiplication, a well-known modern math fact.\n\nRMP 53 calculated two areas of 45/8 setat by 63/8 setat, and a third\narea of an undefined shape discussed by the note, 1/10 of 1 3/8 mh added\nto 10 cubits of land (COL).\n\nThe exact setat measurement unit was 100 cubit by 100 cubit, or 10,000\nsquare cubits. A cubit of land (COL), or mh, was one cubit wide by 100\ncubits long, or 1/100 setat.\n\nThe first area, 45/8 setat, a triangle, had an altitude of 5 khet, and a\nbase of 9/4 khet, was found by triangle formula:\n\n1/2 the base times the altitude, 5\\*(9/4)\\*(1/2)= (45/8) = 5 5/8 setat.\n\nThe second area, also a triangle, had an altitude of 7 khet, and a base\nof 9/4 khet, was also found by a triangle formula:\n\n1/2 the base times the altitude, Ahmes calculated 7\\*(9/4)\\*(1/2) = 63/8\n= 7 7/8 setat\n\nThe third calculation found an area of undefined shape discussed by:\n\n11/8 mh = 110/8 mh + 10 mh = 23 3/4 mh = 1/8 setat + 11 1/4 mh\n\nsince 12 1/2 mh = 1/8 setat.\n\nAlternative views outline the third shape that could have defined a\ntruncated pyramid (base 6, top 3, height 95/18), or a triangle (base 6,\nand altitude 95/12).\n\nTo assist a validated decoding of the third RMP 53 area RMP 54, and RMP\n55 scribal guidelines have been consulted.\n\nRMP 54 partitioned 7/10 setat by 10, 5, 2 1/2 and 1 1/4 segments. Proof\nwas provided by multiplying one setat by 7/10, 14/10, 28/10 and 56/10\nwithin a quotient and remainder context. A quotient setat and a scaled\nremainder mh were scaled as the 2/n table and a ro unit in hekat (volume\nunit) were scaled, by writing:\n\na\\. (7/10)\\*(4/4) = 28/40 = (24 + 3)/40 = 3/8 setat + 300/40 mh = 5/8\nsetat + 7 1/2 mh\n\nb\\. (14/10)\\*(4/4) = 56/10 = (55 + 1)/40 = 11/8 setat + 100/4 mh = 1 3/8\nsetat + 2 1/2 mh\n\nc\\. (28/10)\\*(2/2) = 56/20 = (55 + 1)/20 = 11/4 setat + 100/20 mh = 2 3/4\nsetat + 5 mh\n\nd\\. (56/10) = (55 + 1)/10 = 11/2 setat + 100/10 COL = 5 1/2 setat + 10 mh\n\nAhmes may have also made calculations thinking in mh unuts. For example,\n\nAhmes shorthand partition of 7/10 setat, (1/2 + 1/5) setat, may have\nfocused upon 1/5 setat written as 20 mh. Knowing 12 1/2 mh was 1/8\nsetat, an answer may have been recorded by:\n\n(1/2 + 1/5)setat = (1/2 + 1/8 + (20 - 12 1/2 mh) = 5/8 setat + 7 1/2 mh.\n\nRMP 55 took 3/5 of 5 setat to obtain 3 setat by four steps (a to d):\n\na\\. 1/2 setat + 10 mh\n\nb\\. (1 + 1/8) setat + (7 + 1/2) mh\n\nc\\. (1 + 3/8) setat + (2 + 1/2) setat\n\nd\\. adding steps a and c, and knowing (12 + 1/2) mh = 1/8 setat\n\n(1/2 setat + 10 mh) + \\[(1 + 3/8) setat + (2+ 1/2)mh\\] = (2 + 7/8)setat\n+ (1 + 2 + 1/2) mh = 3 setat\n\nScribes in RMP 41, 42, 43, MMP 10 and the Kahun Papyrus used of four\narea (A) and volume (V) formulas that replaced radius (R) by diameter\n(D/2) and pi by 256/81 in the area of circle formula allowing\n\nA = (256/81)(D/2)(D/2) = (64/81)(D)(D), and adding height (H) four\nformula were written as:\n\na\\. A = (8/9)(8/9)(D)(D) cubits (MMP 10, and RMP 41)\n\nb\\. V = (H)(8/9)(8/9)(D)(D) cubits (RMP 42)\n\nc\\. V = (3/2)(H)(8/9)(8/9)(D)(D) khar (RMP 42)\n\nd\\. V = (2/3)(H)((4/3)(4/3)(D)(D) khar (RMP 43 and the Kahun Papyrus)\n\ne.In RMP 44 1500 khar times (1/20) = (75) 400-hekat, was not (75)\n\u2019100-quadruple hekat\u2019 The correct 400-hekat point was a point that was\ntrue for RMP 41, 42 and 43 by: \u201c... I refer you again to Spalinger\u2019s SAK\n17 article and his discussions of RMP Book II (pp. 320-323), and to\nGriffith\u2019s writings on the RMP (as referenced by Spalinger) in PSBA\n13-16, and to Griffith again in PSBA 14. As Griffith says in the latter\n(p. 429) in regard to whether single, double or quadruple hekats are\nintended: \u201dthe meaning is implied by context\u201c, and he adds in regard to\nhundreds of quadruple hekats that: \u201dI conclude, therefore, that the\nscribe uses a rather inaccurate but perfectly intelligible abbreviation\nof language, in saying that \u201975 is the number of quadruple hekt\u2019 when\n(in may not be the truth) that 75 is the number of complete squares (of\n100 each) of the quadruple hekt\u201c (p. 430) ...\u201d.\n\nRMP 43 4096/9 x 1/20 = (22 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/180) 100 hekat was listed on\nline 5 as:\n\n\\*f. 1/180 400 hekat =\n\n4 x \\[100/180 = (5/9)x (64/64) = 320/576 = (288 + 18 + 9)/576 + 5/576 =\n1/2 + 1/32 + 1/64 + (25/9)ro\\] =\n\n4 x (100/180) = (5/9) x 4 x (64/64) = 4 x 320/576 = 4x (288 + 18 +\n9)/576 + 5/576 = 1/2 + 1/32 + 1/64 + (25/9)4-ro\\]\n\nwith (25/9)4-ro = (2) 4-ro + (7/9)4-ro = (2) 4-ro + (28/36)4-ro =\n\n\\(2) 4-ro + (18 + 9 + 1)/36 4-ro = (2) 4- ro + (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/36) 4-ro\n\n1 cubit-cubit-cubit = (3/2)khar =30 hekat (reported in RMP 41, 42, and\n43),\n\n(2/3)cubit-cubit-cubit = 1 khar = 20 hekat (reported in RMP 41, 42 and\n43),\n\n(2/15) cubit-cubit-cubit = (1/5)khar = 4 hekat (reported in RMP 41, 42\nand 43)\n\nThe hekat was also used to pay wages. An inverse pesu unit monitored\nexact amounts of grain in a loaf of bread, a glass of beer, and other\nproducts, such that wages were paid from two to eight hekats per worker\nper 30 days. The Reisner Papyri documents terseset badges were worn that\nauthorized 10 day payments. RMP 1 to 6 dealt with labor managements\nissues on another level.\n\n[9]{} A.B.
