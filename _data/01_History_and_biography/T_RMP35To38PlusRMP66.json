  "definition": "The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP) in RMP 35-38 and RMP 66 report two\nclasses of . The first replaced one hekat by a 64/64, hence forth a\nhekat unity. The second replaced a hekat scaled by (64/64) x (5/5) =\n320/320 = 320 ro. RMP 36 discussed 320 ro. One tenth of a hekat, 10 hin,\nwere discussed in RMP 83. Another unit, 64 dja, was the focus of the\nEbers Papyrus medical formulas.\n\nThe first method was recorded five times in Akhmim Wooden Tablet\nproblems, as well in RMP 47, 82, and 83 problems.\n\nThe second method converted 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, 15/53, 28/53, and 30/53 to\nunit fraction series in RMP 36. Initial and intermediate calculations\ninfer the 320 ro substitution for 64/64. In , summarized by:\n\nA. RMP 35: Find 3/10 of one hekat in ro units\n\n1\\. 320 ro \\* 3/10 = 96 ro\n\n2\\. The 96 ro data created a unity from\n\na\\. 320\\*3/10 = 96 ro\n\nb\\. 320\\*6/10 = 192 ro\n\nc\\. 320\\*1/10 = 32 ro\n\nd\\. Unity sum 320 ro = 1 hekat\n\nB. RMP 36 solved 3x + (1/3)x + 1/5(x) = 1 hekat\n\n(45x + 5x + 3x)/15 = 1\n\n(53/15)x = 1\n\n53x = 15 and\n\nx = 15/53 hekat\n\nwas solved much as rational number and algebra problems were solved by\nGreek, Arab, and medieval scribes. Ahmes used modern-like multiplication\nand division operations. To Ahmes, the division of a rational number by\nanother rational number inverted the divisor, and multiplied. Ahmes did\nnot use the 1920s \u2019single false position\u2019 division method. With division\nand multiplication answers in-hand, Ahmes applied a duplation\nmultiplication operation in his proof.\n\nThe conversions of 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, and 15/53 were scaled to numerator\n60 by selecting LCM m values of 30, 20, 12 and 4, respectively. Each\nnumerator was assigned a denominators 53m. A fifth rational number 28/53\nwas scaled to numerator 56 and assigned a denominator 106. Considering\nall five rational number conversions Ahmes scaled n/53 to mn/53m, with\nnumerator mn additively parsed by selecting the best divisors of m. The\nselected divisors of m were denoted in red ink. A required conversion of\n30/53 to a unit fraction series was obtained by the substitution of\n28/53 + 2/53.\n\nFibonacci used a related two-step method to convert otherwise impossible\nrational numbers like 4/13. Fibonacci used the same LCM 4 in a\nsubtraction contact (as Ahmes used in RMP 37).\n\nStep one reported (4/13 - 1/4) = (16 - 13)/52 = 3/52\n\nAhmes solved 3/52 by inspecting the divisors of 52, finding (2 + 1) = 3\n\n3/52 = (2 + 1)/52 = 1/26 + 1/52 meant 4/13 = 1/4 + 1/26 + 1/52\n\nFibonacci\u2019s second step solved 3/52 with LCM 18 per\n\n(3/52 - 1/18) = (54 = 52)/936 = 2/936 = 1/468 meant 4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 +\n1/468\n\nIn RMP 18-23, the scribe worked \u201ccompletion to 1 algebra problems\u201d that\npracticed the selection of LCMs. In RMP 24 - 34, algebra lessons were\nworked that led up to scribe to obtain x = 15/53 hekat in RMP 36.\n\nAhmes converted 15/53 to a unit fraction series by considering:\n\n(15/53)\\*(4/4) = 60/212 = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/212= (1/4 + 1/53 + 1/106 +\n1/212) hekat.\n\nAhmes converted 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, 28/53, and 30/53 to unit fraction\nseries by following 2/n table rules within two proofs.\n\n1\\. The first proof considered:\n\na\\. 15/53\\*(4/4) = 60/212= (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/212 = 1/4 + 1/53 + 1/106 +\n1/212\n\nb\\. 30/53 = 2/53 + 28/53= (2/53)\\*(30/30) + (28/53)\\*(2/2) = 1/30 + 1/318\n+ 795 + 1/2 + 1/53 + 1/106\n\nc\\. 5/53 = (5/53)\\*(12/12) = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/636= 1/12 + 1/159 + 1/318 +\n1/636\n\nd\\. 3/53 = (3/53)\\*(20/20) = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/1060)= 1/20 + 265 + 1/530 +\n1/1060\n\ne\\. sum: 2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/63 = 53/53 = one (hekat unity)\n\n2\\. The second proof considered 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, 15/53, 28/53 and 30/53)\nas parts of a hekat in terms of numbers, and other issued per:\n\n15/53 = 15/53 (4/4) = 60/212= (53 + 4 + 2 + 1 )/212\\] = 1/4 + 1/53 +\n1/106 + 1/212\n\nb\\. (35 + 1/3) + (3 + 1/3) + (1 + 2/3) + 20 + 10 = 70 scaled 28/53 + 2/53\n= 30/53\n\nc\\. (88 + 1/3) + (6 + 2/3) + (3 + 1/3) + (1+ 2/3)= 100 scaled 3/53 =\n60/1060 = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)\n\nd\\. 53 + 4 + 2 + 1 scaled (3/53) = (3/53)\\*(20/20)= 60/1060 = (53 + 4 + 2\n+ 1)/1060\n\ne\\. Each part of 15/53 = (1/4 + 1/53 + 1/106 + 1/212)hekat 3/53 and 5/53\nare multiples of 15/53.\n\nConclusion: Proofs converted 2/53, 3/53, 15/5, 28/53, and 30/53, with\n\n30/53 = 2/53 + 28/53\n\nand\n\n2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/53 = 53/53 = one hekat (unity)\n\nUnity aspects were mentioned by Peet within 45/53 + 5/53 + 3/53 = 1\nhekat. Ahmes proofs contained proto-number theory that were not\nmentioned by Peet, Chace or .\n\nFor example, red auxiliary numbers were incorrectly parsed by Peet,\nChace and Clagett in RMP 36. RMP 36 generally converted one difficult\nn/p, 30/53, by solving for (n -2)/p + 2/p, a method that was used in RMP\n31 to convert 28/97 = 2/97 + 26/97.\n\nA second set of RMP 36 facts showed that Ahmes\u2019 used multiplication and\ndivision as inverse operations (as discussed in RMP 24-34) as well as\nconverting 7/212, 7/106, 7/53 and 3/53 by red auxiliary proofs that\nsummed to 265, showing that the parts of 1060 are 530 + 265 + 265.\n\nC. RMP 37: Find 1/90 of a hekat in ro units from:\n\n1\\. 320 ro\\*(1/90) = 3 + 1/2 + 1/18 = 64/18\n\n2\\. Ahmes playfully reported four unity sum methods, the first being:\n\na\\. 320\\*(1/180) = 64/36\n\nb\\. 320\\*(1/360) = 64/72\n\nc\\. 320\\*(1/720) = 64/144\n\nd\\. 320\\*(1/1440) = 64/288\n\ne\\. 320\\*(1/2880) = 64/576\n\nf\\. unity sum (b + e) = 64/72 + 64/576 = 1\n\nThree inverse red number calculations included -like conversion of 1/4 =\n72/288 = (9 + 18 + 24 + 3 + 8 + 1 + 8 + 1)/288, with additive numerators\nrecorded in red ink. Ahmes aligned red numbers (9 + 18 + 24 + 3 + 8 + 1\n+ 8 + 1) below a non-optimal(1/32 + 1/16 + 1/12 + 1/96 + 1/36 + 1/288 +\n1/36 + 1/288) series. The paired lines meant that red integers were\ninverses of unit fractions. Ahmes recorded 1/8 as 72/576 with (8 + 36 +\n18 + 9 + 1) recorded in red, again below (1/72 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 +\n1/576), ending the playful problem.\n\nD. RMP 38 multiply one hekat by 7/22, written in ro units.\n\n1\\. 320\\*(35/11)\\*(1/10) = 320\\*(7/22)= (101 + 9/11)ro\n\n2\\. Three implications of the proof are:\n\na\\. (101 + 9/11)\\*(22/7) = 320 ro = 1 hekat\n\nb\\. A complete hekat was returned as Ahmes by inverting the divisor 7/22\nto 22/7. This may have meant that 22/7 was a better approximation for pi\nthan 256/81. A second aspect of the proof revealed scribal\nmultiplication and division as inverse to one another, a property of\nmodern arithmetic overlooked by 20th century scholars. that\nmultiplication and division were ssen as inverse operations. \\*\\*\\*\n\nc\\. A geometry implication considered the traditional hekat that used\n$$pi = 256/81$$. The traditional pi approximation overstated inventory\nvolumes. To attempt to correct for inventory losses a practical $$22/7$$\napproximation was implemented by Ahmes.\n\nE. RMP 66: divided 10 hekats of fat by 365 days reporting a daily usage\nrate\n\na\\. 3200/365 = 8 + 2/3 + 1/10 + 1/2190 = 8 + 280/365 was given as the\nanswer. A fragmented calculation was implied.\n\nAhmes divided 3200 by 365. Fragmented calculations reported\n\n(246 + 1/3) + (36 + 1/2) + 1/6 = 280, meant that\n\n3200/365 = 8 + 280/365 = 8 + 56/73 in modern arithmetic\n\nAhmes scaled 8 + (280/365 by 6/6) raising 1/6 to a unit such that:\n\n8 + 1680/2190 was parsed by (1460 + 219 + 1)/2160 = 8 + 2/3 + 1/10 +\n1/219\n\ncompleted the calculation.\n\nb\\. summarized RMP 66 in an inappropriate additive manner only suggesting\nthat Ahmes\u2019 duplation proof:\n\n2\\. 730\n\n4\\. 1460\n\n8 (a). 2920\n\n2/3(b) 243 1/3\n\n1/10(c) 36 1/2\n\n1/2160(d) 1/2160\n\nwas Ahmes; calculation, which it was not. Ahmes had the 8 + 2/3 + 1/10 +\n1/2190 answer in hand, and applied the traditional Old Kingdom duplation\nproof, confirming each unit fraction in the answer.\n\nF. Reference (1): A.B. Chace, Bull, L. , Manning, H.P. and Archibald,\nR.C., The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, Mathematical Association of\nAmerica, Vol 1, 1927, vol 2, 1929, and reprint 1979 (NCTM)\ntransliterated the scribal unit fraction shorthand. To translate Ahmes\u2019\nshorthand to modern arithmetic statements initial calculations and other\narithmetic steps are parsed and added back, as noted above. and\ncollaborated on this project.\n\nG. Reference (2) Marshall Clagett, 1999, Egyptian Science and\nMathematics (Volume III) includes Chace\u2019s 1927 views of the RMP, as well\nas transliterations of the Kahun Papyrus, the Moscow Mathematical\nPapyrus. The valid transliterations should not be considered complete\ntranslations. Missing initial and intermediate arithmetic steps were not\nparsed, and inserted, as well as the other mathematics, i.e. the\nattested arithmetic operations used by all Middle Kingdom scribes, info\nrequired to prepare complete translations.\n\nH. Reference (3) Joran Friberg, 2005, \u201cUnexpected links to Egyptian and\nBabylonian Mathematics\u201d includes the outdated Gillings, Chace, and Peet\n1920\u2019s transliterations contrasted to Babylonian mathematics. Again,\nFriberg did not add back the missing initial and intermediate Egyptian\nfraction statements, or discuss the Akhmim Wooden Tablet in a serious\nway to create valid translations to modern mathematics.",
