  "definition": "The [*Erd\u0151s-Bacon number*]{} of a mathematician or an actor is the sum\nof their and their Bacon number. Not many professional mathematicians\nhave had film r\u00f4les. However, a few important ones have done consulting\nwork for Hollywood films about mathematicians, such as [*A Beautiful\nMind*]{}. For example, William Timothy Gowers, who has Erd\u0151s number 4,\nwas a consultant for [*Proof*]{}, with Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead r\u00f4le.\nPaltrow was in [*se7en*]{} with Endre Hules, who was in [*Apollo 13*]{}\nwith Kevin Bacon. Thus Gowers has an Erd\u0151s-Bacon number of 7. Daniel\nKleitman, consultant for [*Good Will Hunting*]{}, has an even smaller\nErd\u0151s-Bacon number, 3, since he co-authored a paper with Erd\u0151s and the\nfilm included Minnie Driver, who starred with Bacon in [*Sleepers*]{}.\nThe smallest likely Erd\u0151s-Bacon number would probably be 2, if an Erd\u0151s\nco-author consulted for a movie starring Bacon. It\u2019s also possible that\nKevin Bacon could co-author a mathematical paper with an Erd\u0151s\nco-author, but this appears unlikely.",
