  "definition": "*Elizaveta Fedorovna Litvinova* n\u00e9e *Elizaveta Fedorovna Ivanshkina*\n(1845 - 1919?) Russian mathematician, biographer and women\u2019s activist.\n\nBorn in czarist Russia, young Elizaveta\u2019s early education was at a\nwomen\u2019s high school in St. Petersburg. In 1866 Elizaveta married Viktor\nLitvinov and took his last name. Unlike Vladimir Kovalevskii (Sofia\nKovalevskaya\u2019s husband), Litvinov would not allow his wife to travel to\nEurope to study at the universities there. Litvinova studied with\nStrannoliubskii (who had also privately tutored Kovalevskaya). As soon\nas her husband died, Litvinova went to Z\u00fcrich and enrolled at a\npolytechnic institute. In 1873 the Russian czar decreed all Russian\nwomen studying in Z\u00fcrich had to return to Russia or the consequences.\nLitvinova was one of the few to ignore the decree and continue her\nstudies in Z\u00fcrich. When Litvinova returned to Russia, she was denied\nuniversity appointments because she had defied the 1873 recall. She\ntaught at a women\u2019s high school and supplemented her income by writing\nbiographies of more famous mathematicians such as Kovalevskaya and\nAristotle. After retiring, it is believed that Litvinova died during the\nRussian Revolution in 1919.\n\n[1]{} A. H.
