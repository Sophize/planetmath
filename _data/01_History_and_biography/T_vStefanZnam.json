For example, in\n1968, Zn\u00c3\u00a1m wrote a paper on \u201cStrongly geodetic graphs\u201d with Juraj\nBos\u00c3\u00a1k in the [*Journal of Combinatorial Theory*]{}. Three years later,\nBos\u00c3\u00a1k co-authored \u201cDecompositions of complete graphs into factors with\ndiameter two\u201d with Erd\u00c5\u2018s and Alexander Rosa in [*Mathematics Casopis\nSlovene Akademie Vied*]{}.",
