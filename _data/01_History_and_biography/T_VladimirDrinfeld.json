  "definition": "*Vladimir Gershonovich Drinfel\u2019d* (born 1954) Ukrainian mathematician\nand mathematical physicist. Proposing the term Drinfel\u2019d indicated the\nconnection between quasi-triangular Hopf algebras and solutions of the\nquantum Yang-Baxter equations involving the R-matrix. Subsequently,\nquantum groups have become a field of thorough mathematical\ninvestigation and the construction of finite quantum groups from Hopf\nalgebras or, more recently, from Hopf C\\*-algebras has been carried out\nin detail [*via*]{} Fourier transformation as such finite groups are\ndual to certain . he also introduced the contruction of the quantum\ndouble leading later to quantum supergroups and quantized enveloping\nsuperalgebras. are named after him. He was awarded and accepted the\nFields medal in 1990.",
