  "definition": "The [*Ishango bone*]{} is an ancient baboon bone with numerical markings\non it which was unearthed in a bank of Edward Lake in the Congo by\ngeologist Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt. Carbon dating shows the bone\nis at least 20,000 years old. Now on exhibit at the museum of the Royal\nBelgian Institute of Natural Sciences, it is characterized as \u201cthe\noldest mathematical artifact.\u201d\n\nThe bone has three columns of numbers, the middle column reads: 3, 6, 4,\n8, 10, 5, 5, 7 (this sequence is A100000 in Sloane\u2019s OEIS). The other\ntwo columns read: 11, 13, 17, 19 (a prime quadruplet); and 11, 21, 19,\n9. The columns add up to 60, 48 and 60.\n\nMathematicians and scientists have speculated on the meaning of the\nnumbers on the bone. Alexander Marshack believes the bone might be a\nlunar calendar, while Claudia Zaslavsky speculates the author was a\nwoman tracking her menstrual cycle. Number theorists note that 48 and 60\nare both multiples of 12 and cite this as evidence of the early humans\u2019\nability to multiply.\n\n[4]{} D.
