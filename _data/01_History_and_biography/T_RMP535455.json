  "definition": "Early in the 21 century AD an innovative set of decoding keys update\ntranslations of hieratic math texts. The keys add-back missing initial\nand intermediate mathematical facts that scribal shorthand had omitted.\nScholars in the 19th and 20th centuries, i.e. Peet, published additive\nhieratic math texts by mentioning the need for studies.\n\nFirst level decoding keys consider two sides of scribal theoretical and\npractical math statements of longer story lines. For example, first\nlevel keys translate RMP 53, 54 and 55 raw data in ways that expose\nscribal theoretical and practical geometry recorded in setats.\n\nSecond level keys add-back theoretical aspects of RMP 53, 54 and 55\nsetat statements that connect to 2/n tables. As background a 2008 study\nreported RMP and the Kahun Papyrus 2/n tables were parsed within an\naliquot part method that was suggested by F. Hultsch in 1895.The\ntheoretical approach was confirmed by E.M. Bruins in 1944. The second\nlevel view of RMP 53, 54 and 55 arithmetic fragments shows that\nnumerators and divisors of 2/n table answers were recorded in either an\nadditive or a subtraction context.\n\n1\\. The additive context reports 2/n = (2/n)(m/m) = 2m/mn, the context\nthat Ahmes tended to record. The primary method structured RMP 53-54-55\ncubit as rational number statements. Ahmes demonstrate three conversion\nmethods that converted rational numbers 2/3 to 2/101 to concise unit\nfraction series in the .\n\nRMP 53, 54 and 55 also used the 2/m table scaling method per:\n\na\\. 2/53\\*(30/30) = 60/1590 = (53 + 5 + 2)/1590 = 1/30 + 1/318 + 1/795\n\nb\\. 2/73\\*(60/60) = 120/(60\\*73) = (73 + 20+ 15+ 12)/(60\\*73) = 1/60 +\n1/219 + 1/292 + 1/365\n\nWhen 2/n and n/p could not be scaled by one (m/m) Ahmes in RMP 31\n(28/97) and RMP 35 (30/53) solved n/p by solving two separate problems\n\nn/p = (n -2)/p and 2/p,\n\nand summed the unit fractions into one series. In the case of 28/97\nAhmes solved 26/97 by (4/4) to 104/388, and 2/97 by (56/56) to 112/5432.\nIn the case of 30/53 solved 28/53 by (2/2) to 56/106 and 2/53 by 30/30\nto 60/1590.\n\nMiddle Kingdom scribes like Ahmes may have used the subtraction context\nin limited ways, such as:\n\nc\\. (2/43 - 1/42) = (84-43)/1806 = (21 + 14 + 6)/1806 = 1/42 + 1/86 +\n1/129 + 1/301 (2/n table) d. (26/97 - 1/4) = (104 - 97)/388 = (97 + 4 +\n2 + 1)/388 = 1/4 + 1/97 + 1/194 + 1/388 (RMP 31)\n\nand two EMLR-like series scaled by by m/m = 72/72 in RMP 37, an Ahmes\nfragment.\n\n2\\. The subtraction context was reported by Arabs, and hinted at by\nAhmes. Arabs demonstrated the subtraction method that Fibonacci used to\nscale rational numbers to awkward unit fraction series per:\n\n(2/n - 1/m) = (2m - n)/mn, with (2m -n) set to unity in 1202 AD as often\nas possible, one of three medieval rational number notations.\n\nWhen unity could not be reached two-separate problems were solved. For\nexample Fibonacci reported by Sigler\u2019s as a 7th distinction converted\n4/13 by LCM 4, finding a remainder 3/52, and solved 3/53 by LCM 18 such\nthat\n\n4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468.\n\nGreeks may have created the Arab notation, one of three that were\nreported in the Liber Abaci. It is possible that Ahmes himself used the\nsubtraction notation from time to time. RMP 37 reports a scaling of 1/4\nand 1/8 by LCM 72 to EMLR-like unit fraction series, a story-line that\ngoes beyond the RMP 53-54-55, the issues of this PM entry.\n\nThird level keys test the practical contents of 5MP 53, 54 and 55\nagainst theoretical methods. In his 2/n table Ahmes\u2019 red auxiliary\nnumbers pointed out additive numerators written within a multiplication\ncontext. In RMP 21-23 additional background facts shows that Ahmes\nselected LCM multipliers closer to the first method, 2/n =2/n\\*(m/m) =\n2/mn.\n\nAdditive 20th century scholars tended to muddle hieratic math texts.\nTransliterations misread scribal math contents by stressing additive\nparadigms and minimizing potential meta scribal math issues. Finding\nmeta scribal mathematical methods by reading texts from three different\npoints of view birthed the three decoding keys that include hints of\nscribal theoretical and practical thinking, one double checking the\nother.\n\nHints of theoretical scribal math date to the 114 year old Hultsch-Bruin\nsuggestion of aliquot parts. In the 2/43 case the aliquot parts of 42\nconsidered divisors (42, 21, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, and 1). Ahmes selected\nadditive divisors in red ink from the aliquot parts of 42. When n/p\ncould not be scaled by one m/m to mn/mp could not be found record a\nconcise unit fraction series Ahmes used a second method. The second\nmethod replaced n/p with (n -2)/p (m1/m1) + 2/p(m2/m2). The second\nscaling method did not work every time. Fibonacci used a closely related\ntwo-phase conversion method in a 7th distinctions in tbat (Liber Abaci)\ntbat emulated Ahmes two methods, one than one included Ahmes third\nmethod reported in RMP 36, unity (1) = 53/53 = (2/53)(30/30) +\n(3/53)(20/20) + (5/53)(12/12) + (15/53)(4/4) + (28/53)(2/2).\n\nConclusions: Translating RMP 53, 54, and 55 by three keys report Ahmes\u2019\nraw data included theoretical cubit, khet units, and setat and mh areas.\nOne substitution of one setat by two LCM multipliers, 4 and 2,\nfacilitated the partition, the conversion, of a setat into 1/8 setat and\nmh units as 2/n table members were partitioned/converted.\n\nThe LCM data reported cubit and khet units written in setat areas, 100\ncubit by 100 cubits. Setats were sub-divided into 1/100 setat strips, or\nmh units. A first reading of RMP 54 included Ahmes\u2019 implicit use of the\nLCM 2/n table conversion method. Ahmes scaled a setat unit to (4/4) and\n(2/2) before multiplying by 7/10, 14/10 and 28/10, respectively, such\nthat:\n\n1\\. (7/10)\\*(4/4) setat = 28/40 setat = (25 + 3)/40 setat\n\nallowed the 2/n table LCM scaling method to confirm that\n\n2\\. 5/8 setat + 300/40 mh = 5/8 setat + 7 1/2 mh.\n\ndescribed the scibal method and correct answer.\n\nThe first keys read RMP 55 impliy that Ahmes computed in mh units, as 5\nsetat times 3/5 was solved and written out.\n\nSecond level RMP 53, 54 and 55 keys consider closely related theoretical\ncontents of the Akhmim Wooden Tablet, as reported by Hana Vymazalova in\n2002. Vymazalova reported that one hekat was divided by 3, 7, 10, 11 and\n13, was exactly returned to (64/64) (as Daressy had not seen in 1906).\nThe RMP also reported the AWT method as an implicit initial substitution\nover 36 times. As one theoretical method, the AWT and RMP replaced a\nhekat by (64/64), a hekat unity, to allow the division by n, limited to\n1/64 &lt; n &lt; 64 over 40 times.\n\nThe theoretical AWT substitution method appeared in RMP 47. Ahmes\nreported 100 hekat written as 6400/64, divided by 70 to compute a\nquotient 91/64 and a remainder 30/(70\\*64), scaled to a ro unit, writing\n(150/70)\\*1/320 as the answer. An intermediate step included:\n\n\\[(64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1)/64\\]hekat + (2 + 1/7)\\*1/320, or\n\nAhmes\u2019 answer recorded:\n\n\\[1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64\\]hekat + \\[2 + 1/7\\]ro\n\nA second theoretical substitution method replaced one hekat with 320 ro.\nThis method may have replaced the \u201cawkward\u201d 6400/64 substitution of 100\nhekat method reported in RMP 47.\n\nIn RMP 38, the division of one hekat, written as 320 ro, was multiplied\nby 7/22, and returned by 320 ro when multiplied by 22/7. A confirmation\nof the RMP 38 method is provided by RMP 35. RMP 35 dividing 10 hekat of\nfat, written as 3200 ro, by 365. Ahmes reported a rate (8 + 280/365)ro,\nwhich was returned to 3200 ro by multiplying the answer by 365.\n\nThird level RMP 53, 54 and 55 keys conclude that Ahmes\u2019 division and\nmultiplication methods were inverse operations, a feature of modern\nmultiplication and division operations.\n\nAnother view of cubit partitions is found in a fragmented text, which\nmay have found a portion of a cubit defined by 1/3 of a palm: Given 1/14\na cubit is 1/2 a palm \\[aka 2 fingers\\]. Operate on 1/2 palm to find 1/3\npalm to find 2/3 of 1/2 palm = 2/6 = 1/3 palm and find 2/3 of 1/14 =\n2/42 = 1/21 cubits.\n\nSUMMARY: Three level decoding keys update translations of RMP 53, 54,\nand 53 by adding-back missing theoretical facts that connect to 2/n\ntables and other meta scribal rules. Confirming keys follow Occam\u2019s\nRazor considerations, the simplest version was the historical method.\nThe keys translate hieratic arithmetic, algebra, geometry and weights\nand measures methods by adding back theoretical facts that scribes\nomitted. The updated translations of the correct 20th century additive\nscholars had not directly considered theoretical aspects of 2/n tables,\nand geometry calculations.\n\n[10]{} A.B.
