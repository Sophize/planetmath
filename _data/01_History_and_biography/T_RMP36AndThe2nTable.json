  "definition": "The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP), a 1650 BCE hieratic text, began\nwith a 2/n table. The table of unit fraction series included shorthand\ncalculations that took up 1/3 of a papyrus. The RMP also stated and\nsolved 87 problems. The 2/n table contained 51 representations of\nrational numbers 2/n that were scaled to concise unit fraction series. A\ntrivial 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 series and 50 non-trivial series was written\ndown by Ahmes, the RMP scribe. Ahmes converted more difficult rational\nnumbers 2/5 to 2/101 to concise unit fraction series by proto-number\ntheory methods.\n\nAhmes scaled 2/n by optimized least common multiples (LCMs) within\nproto-number theory methods that were often misunderstood by 20th\ncentury AD scholars. Aspects of RMP 36 and RMP 37 hekat (volume)\nproblems were also misreported by 20th century scholars. Scholars\nunderstated Middle Kingdom proto-number theory in 2/n tables and hekat\nproblems, raw data facts that scribes like Ahmes considered p and q as\nprime numbers and LCMs as scaling factors.\n\nAhmes raw unit fraction data reported in RMP 36 and 37 reported\nimportant non-additive patterns. In the 21st century AD three classes of\nscaled rational number conversion methods have been decoded. Rational\nnumbers n/p were scaled by m/m to mn/mp and inspected the best divisors\nof mp that summed to mn before writing out concise unit fraction series.\n\nThe first 2/n table conversion method scaled rational number 2/n by LCM\nm to 2m/mn. Ahmes selected \u2019red auxiliary\u2019 divisors of denominator mn\nthat summed to numerator 2m that allowed concise unit fraction series to\nbe recorded. The first conversion method converted 2/3, 2/5, 2/7, ...,\n2/101 to concise unit fraction series.\n\nThe second conversion method shows that Ahmes could not solve 20/53 by\none LCM m. The second rational number conversion method replaced n/p by\n(n-2)/p + 2/p as demonstrated in RMP 36 and RMP 31.\n\nIn RMP 36 Ahmnes did not solve 30/53 by one LCM m. None could be found.\nAhmes solved 28/53 + 2/53 by scaling 28/53 by LCM 2 and 2/53 by LCM 30,\ntwo easy to find LCMs.\n\nNote that the second conversion method solved 30/53 and 28/97 by\nselecting two least common multiples (LCM) m to solve 30/53 = 28/53 +\n2/53 and 28/97 = 26/97 + 2/97 by extending the first conversion method.\nAhmes converted 26/97 by LCM 4 by considering 104/388 before writing a\nfinal unit fraction series. In RMP 31 Ahmes had solved 28/97 by\nselecting two LCM m scaling factors. Ahmes solved 28/97 that scaled\n(26/97 + 2/97) that scaled 26/97 by LCM 4 and scaled 2/97 by LCM 56.\nNote that 2/97 was solved as the 2/n table reported. Hence LCM 56 was a\nwell thought out scaling factor when Ahmes scaled 2/97.\n\nAhmes converted 2/97 by LCM 56 in the 2/n table and RMP 31 that\nconsidered 112/5432 such that divisors (97 + 8 + 7) were recorded in red\nand summed to numerator 112 meant:\n\n2/97 = 112/5432 = (97 + 8 + 7)/5432 = 1/56 + 1/678 + 1/776\n\na complete 2/n table series sentence.\n\nThe same class of LCM m sentence scaled 28/53 by LCM 4 to 104/212 and\n2/53 by LCM 56 to 112/2968 before \u2019red auxilinary numbers\u2019 selected the\nbest divisors of mn. The best divisors were summed to numerator 2m and\ncalculated concise unit fraction series.\n\nAhmes\u2019 second conversion method solved difficult n/p conversions by\nsubstituting (n-2)/p + 2/p by solving two conversion problems.\n\nAhmes solved 87 problems applying three 2/n table conversion methods.\nModern arithmetic operations, algebra, arithmetic proportions and\ngeometric methods were discussed by Ahmes. The first two conversion\nmethods lead to the third method that found the best divisors of\ndenominators mp that summed to numerators mp related to scaling n/p by\nLCM m to mn/mp. Red numbers divisors of denominator mp were summed to\nnumerator mn in RMP 36 reporting:\n\n2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/53 = 53/53 = 1\n\nAhmes could have chosen any set of n/53 partitions that summed to one,\nsuch as:\n\n51/53 + 2/53 = 1 50/53 + 3/53 = 1 49/53 + 4/53 = 1 46/43 + 5/53 = 1\n\nas well as any n/p table at any other time, thereby exposing a third\nconversion method in the context of the hekat, the weights and measures\nunit used to pay and make other business transactions.\n\nSelections of LCM m encoded Ahmes\u2019 2/n table. a fact missed by scholars\nfor over 100 years. The raw 2/n table data is published on-line in:\nresolved this issue. The RMP\u2019s 87 problems reported fragmented initial,\nintermediate, final, and proof information, the central reason for the\nscholarly delay. The correct information had been decoded and translated\ninto modern arithmetic statements by adding back missing initial and\nintermediate steps and facts. The corrected RMP translations were posted\nonline in .\n\nThe corrected RMP and Kahun Papyrus(KP) problems have been decoded by\nopening new doors to MK arithmetic. Once muddled RMP and KP texts that\nwere misunderstood by and other 20th century scholars are corrected by\nnew decoding methods.\n\nRed auxiliary numbers have long been noted by RMP scholars. However,\nfrequent scribal uses of red numbers were not pinned down in Ahmes\u2019 87\nproblems, the KP, and other texts as scribes understood their use until\n2008.\n\nThe best context to decode red auxiliary numbers is RMP 36. RMP 36\noffers scribal evidence of red number details that scaled rational\nnumbers n/p to mn/mp that calculated the by selecting optimized LCMs m.\n\nWhat were the 2/n table series details cited in Ahmes\u2019 87 problems? To\nanswer those questions, the methods reported in RMP will be discussed.\nOne RMP problem, RMP 36, established Ahmes red auxiliary number method\nthat also calculated 2/n table unit fraction series data reported in\nAhmes 87 problems.\n\nRMP 36 solved\n\n3x + (1/3)x + 1/5(x) = 1 (hekat)\n\na simple algebra problem that Ahmes solved in a weights and measures\ncontext.\n\nA duplation proof of the problem considered LCM 15 by solving:\n\n((45 + 5 + 3)x)/15 = 1\n\nsuch that\n\n53x/15 = 1\n\nx = 15/53\n\nAhmes converted 15/53 to a unit fraction series by thinking:\n\n(15/53)\\*(4/4) = 60/212\n\nand writing:\n\n(53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/212= (1/4 + 1/53 + 1/106 + 1/212)hekat\n\nwith 4 + 2 + 1 implicitly recorded in red,\n\nAhmes also considered\n\n106 times 15/53 = 30\n\nWith 30 the LCM that converted 2/53 to a unit fraction series\n\nand,\n\n30 times 53/15 = 106\n\nthe GCD 106 was found by scaling 28/53 by LCM 2 translated as 2/2.\n\nAhmes\u2019 primary division method inverted 15/53 to 53/15, a property of\nmodern division, an arithmetic operational fact also reported in RMP 38.\nScholars writing on this topic in the 19th and 20th century falsely\nconcluded that \u2019single false position\u2019, a medieval method for finding\nroots, was Ahmes\u2019 primary division operation.\n\nAhmes converted 30/53 as 2/53 + 28/53. RMP 36 explicitly converted 3/53\nto unit fraction series by a 2/n table red auxiliary number proof.\n\n1 2/n table proofs included scaled 2/53 + 3/53 + 5/15 + 15/53 + 28/53 =\n53/53 unit fraction calculations:\n\na\\. 2/53 = 2/53\\*(30/30) = 60/1590 = (53 + 5 + 2)/1590 = 1/30 + 1/318 +\n1/79\n\nb\\. 3/53 = 3/53(20/20) = 60/1060 = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/1060 = 1/20 + 1/265 +\n1/530 + 1/1060\n\nc\\. 5/53 = (5/53)\\*(12/12) = 60/636 = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/(12\\*53) = 1/12 +\n1/159 + 1/318 + 1/636\n\nd\\. 15/53 = 15/53\\*(4/4) = 60/212= (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/212 = 1/4 + 1/53 +\n1/106 + 1/212\n\ne\\. 28/73 = (28/53)\\*(2/2) = 56/106 = (53 + 2 + 1)/106 = 1/53 + 1/318 +\n795 + 1/2 + 1/53 + 1/106\n\nf\\. such that: (2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/53)hekat = 53/53 hekat =\none hekat (unity)\n\nNote the repeated used of red numbers (53 + 4 + 2 + 1) that converted\n3/53, 5/53, and 15/53, eie,.\n\n3/53 = (3/53)\\*(20/20) = 60/1060 = (53 + 4 + 2 + 1)/1060\n\nThe proof listed duplation proofs, followed by unit fraction series\ncalculations that considered\n\n15/53 = (1/4 + 1/53 + 1/106 + 1/212)hekat that reported:\n\n1\\. 15/53\\*(4/4) = (60/212 - 1/4) = 7/212 = (4 + 2 + 1)/212 with 4 + 2 +\n1 recorded in red ink.\n\n2\\. 28/53\\*(2/2) = (56/106 - 1/2) = 7/106 = (4 + 2 + 1)/106 with 4 + 2 +\n1 recorded in red ink\n\n3\\. 5/53\\*(12/12) = (60/636 - 1/12) = 7/53 = (4 + 2 + 1)/53 with 4 + 2 +\n1 recorded in red ink\n\n4\\. 3/53\\*(20/20)= 60/1060 - 1/20 =7/1060 = (4 + 2 + 1)/1060 with 4 + 2 +\n1 recorded in red ink\n\nNote that the step introduced a a subtraction statement. the only\ncontext used by Fibonacci 2850 years later to work the same class of\nproblems in the Liber Abaci.\n\nAhmes\u2019 arithmetic also scaled (30/53)+ (15/53) + (5/53)+ (3/53) = 1\n\nsolving 30/53 = 28/53 + 2/53 by applying a red auxiliary method that was\nimplicitly used in the 2/n table. Note that 30/53 nor 28/97 in RMP 31\ncould not be solved by an LCM, hence the substitution of 28/53 + 2/53\nfor 30/53 and 28/97 + 2/97 for 28/97.\n\nConcerning the RMP\u2019s 87 problems Ahmes rarely calculated beginning,\nintermediate, answers, and duplation proofs as modern mathematicians\nunderstand Middle Kingdom arithmetic and mathematics. To fairly parse\nMiddle Kingdom arithmetic explicit details are required.\n\nIn RMP 36 one scribal proof was fairly outlined by Marshall Clagett as\nan ancient multiplication operation. However, meta 2/n table\nconstruction details were unexposed by scholars until published in 2008.\nA majority of 19th and 20th century Egyptologists identified fragmented\nduplation details without fairly describing scribal calculations that\ncreated concise unit fraction series. Missing from academic discussions\nwere precise meanings of red auxiliary numbers and the context in which\nscribal calculations took place. The red numbers and economic aspects\nwere implicitly used in 2/n tables and scribal ways that caused scholars\nto badly guess and muddle the historical record.\n\nIn 2008 RMP 36 and related 2/n table methods were explicitly spelled out\nby solving a critical problem. Rational numbers n/p were scaled to mn/mp\nby selecting optimized, but not optimal LCM m. Ahmes calculated several\nred number examples in RMP 36 that expose his thinking. Ahmes considered\nthe divisors of mp, and selected the best set of divisors that added to\nnumerator mn, by denoting selections in red.\n\nRelated Egyptian fraction method also \u2019healed\u2019 an Old Kingdom \u201cEye of\nHorus\u201d binary numeration problem that wrote:\n\n1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ...\n\nby writing\n\n1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 10 ro\n\nMiddle Kingdom scribes reported the remainder 2/64 as 10/320 in hekat\nproblems The rational number 1/320 was named ro in about 40 RMP\nproblems.\n\nIn other texts, scribes scaled 2/64 to 10/320 and (8 + 2)/320 = 1/40 +\n1/160 writing a complete statement\n\n1 = 1/2 + 1/4+ 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/40 + 1/160\n\nand in RMP 36 by one hekat (unity)= 28/53 + 15/53 + 5/53 + 3/53 + 2/53 =\n53/53\n\nas Middle Kingdom scribes wrote scaled arithmetic statements and solving\nonce impossible \u201cEye of Horus\u201d arithmetic problems created from binary\nbalance beam weights used in the Old Kingdom.\n\nConclusion: RMP 36 exposed three rational number conversion methods. The\nfirst conversion method scaled 2/53 by LCM 30 to 60/1590. A unit\nfraction series was obtained by red numbers 53 + 4 + 2 + 1 equal to\nnumerator 60. The red numbers were \u201cbest\u201d divisors of denominator 1590.\nTaken together red number divisors and concise unit fraction series\nexposed the two of the three 2/n table construction methods. Red number\ndivisors were used to solve an impossible rational number 30/53 by\nsubstituting 28/53 + 2/43 Ahmes solved 28/53 by LCM 4 and 2/53 by LCM\n30. In RMP 31 Ahmes solved another impossible rational number\nconversion. Ahmes solved 28/97 by substituting 26/97 scaled by LCM 4 and\n2/97 scaled by LCM 56. The n/p = (n -2)/p + 2/p substitution defined\nAhmes second conversion method. A third method created virtual n/p\ntables suggested by identity sums: 2/53 + 3/53 + 5/53 + 15/53 + 28/53 =\n53/53, a method that Greeks, Coptics, Arabs and medieval scribes\nstressed. It is important to note that RMP 36 was written in an economic\ncontext. The main purpose of unit fraction arithmetic scaled hekats (of\ngrain) values of beer, bread, and other products for use in wage\npayments.\n\nReferences:",
