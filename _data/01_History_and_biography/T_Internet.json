  "definition": "The [*Internet*]{} is a network of computer terminals and servers for\naccessing documents and media from the [*World Wide Web*]{}.\n\nThe Internet grew out of the radar network of the Defense Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency of the United States. Collaboration between\nHarvard, MIT, DARPA and the National Science Foundation led to the\ncreation of NSFNet in 1983, connecting several universities and\ngovernment agencies. In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee of CERN created\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Hypertext Markup Language\n(HTML). By the late 1990s, with media coverage of the [*information\nsuperhighway*]{}, the Internet became very popular. By the early 2000s,\na large portion of the Internet was devoted to pornography, something\nwhich was spoofed in an episode of [*The Simpsons*]{} in which a video\nof Homer dancing around was described by Lenny as \u201cthe number 1 non-porn\ndownload on the Internet, making you one trillionth overall.\u201d\n\nEven so, there are many important resources on the Internet for the\nsciences and for mathematics. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer\nSequences, run by Neil Sloane, is a significant resource not only for\nnumber theory but for all mathematics. PlanetMath and MathWorld are\nsignificant encyclopedias of mathematical terms, and distributed\ncomputing projects such as the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and\nSeventeen or Bust have discovered increasingly larger numbers of\nspecific kinds. Wolfram Research makes a version of Mathematica called\nwebMathematica for the purpose of spicing up Web pages with \u201cinteractive\ncalculations.\u201d",
