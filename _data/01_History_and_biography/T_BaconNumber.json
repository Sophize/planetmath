  "definition": "The [*Bacon number*]{} is to movie actors what the Erd\u0151s number is to\nmathematicians, only the connections are through films, and the central\nactor to connect to is Kevin Bacon. Because of the play [*Six Degrees of\nSeparation*]{}, the common wisdom held that most actors could be linked\nin six steps. In fact, for most actors working today, whether in\nHollywood, Bollywood, or anywhere in the world, can be connected to\nBacon in just two steps. Even actors from the black and white era can be\nconnected to Bacon in as short as three steps. For example, Nikolai\nCherkasov (of [*Alexander Nevsky*]{} fame) was in [*Nights of\nFarewell*]{} with Jacques Ferriere, who was in [*Le Chainon manquant*]{}\nwith Bill Murray, who was in [*Wild Things*]{} with Kevin Bacon.",
