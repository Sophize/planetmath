  "definition": "The symbol $\\pi$ was first introduced by William Jones [@higham; @jones]\nin 1706 to denote the ratio between the perimeter and the diameter on\nany given circle. In other words, dividing the perimeter of any circle\nby its diameter always gives the same answer, and this number is defined\nto be $\\pi$. A 12-digit approximation of $\\pi$ is given by\n$3.14159265358...$\n\nOver human history there were many attempts to calculate this number\nprecisely. One of the oldest approximations appears in the Rhind Papyrus\n(circa 1650 B.C.) where a geometrical construction is given where\n$(16/9)^2=3.1604\\ldots$ is used as an approximation to $\\pi$ although\nthis was not explicitly mentioned.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Greeks that there were systematical attempts to\ncalculate $\\pi$. Archimedes [@Mact], in the third century B.C. used\nregular polygons inscribed and circumscribed to a circle to approximate\n$\\pi$: the more sides a polygon has, the closer to the circle it becomes\nand therefore the ratio between the polygon\u2019s area between the square of\nthe radius yields approximations to $\\pi$. Using this method he showed\nthat $223/71<\\pi<22/7$ $(3.140845\\ldots<\\pi<3.142857\\ldots)$.\n\nAround the world there were also attempts to calculate $\\pi$.\nBrahmagupta [@Mact] gave the value of $\\sqrt{10}=3.16227\\ldots$ using a\nmethod similar to Archimedes\u2019. Chinese mathematician Tsu Chung-Chih (ca.\n500 A.D.) gave the approximation $355/113=3.141592920\\ldots$.\n\nLater, during the renaissance, Leonardo de Pisa (Fibonacci) [@Mact] used\n96-sideed regular polygons to find the approximation\n$864/275=3.141818\\ldots$\n\nFor centuries, variations on Archimedes\u2019 method were the only tool\nknown, but Vi\u00e8te [@Mact] gave in 1593 the formula\n$$\\frac{2}{\\pi}=\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}}}\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{2}}}}}\\cdots$$\nwhich was the first analytical expression for $\\pi$ involving infinite\nsummations or products. Later with the advent of calculus many of these\nformulas were discovered. Some examples are Wallis\u2019 [@Mact] formula:\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{2}{1}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{6}{5}\\cdots$$\nand Leibniz\u2019s formula,\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{4}=1-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{11}+\\cdots,$$\nobtained by developing $\\arctan(\\pi/4)$ using power series, and with\nsome more advanced techniques, $$\\pi=\\sqrt{6\\zeta(2)},$$ found by\ndetermining the .\n\nThe Leibniz expression provides an alternate way to define $\\pi$ (namely\n4 times the limit of the series) and it is one of the formal ways to\ndefine $\\pi$ when studying analysis in order to avoid the geometrical\ndefinition.\n\nIt is known that $\\pi$ is not a rational number (quotient of two\nintegers). Moreover, $\\pi$ is not algebraic over the rationals (that is,\nit is a transcendental number). This means that no polynomial with\nrational coefficients can have $\\pi$ as a root. Its irrationality\nimplies that its decimal expansion (or any integer base for that matter)\nis not finite nor periodic.\n\n[99]{} The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, *The ubiquitous\n$\\pi$* \\[Dario Castellanos\\] Mathematics Magazine Vol 61, No. 2.
