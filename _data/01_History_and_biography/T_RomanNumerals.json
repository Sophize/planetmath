  "definition": "*Roman numerals* are a method of writing numbers employed primarily by\nthe ancient Romans. It place of digits, the Romans used letters to\nrepresent the numbers central to the system:\n\n  ----- --------\n   $I$    $1$\n   $V$    $5$\n   $X$    $10$\n   $L$    $50$\n   $C$   $100$\n   $D$   $500$\n   $M$   $1000$\n  ----- --------\n\nLarger numbers can be made by writing a bar over the letter, which means\none thousand times as much. For instance $\\overline{V}$ is $5000$.\n\nOther numbers were written by putting letters together. For instance\n$II$ means $2$. Larger letters go on the left, so $LII$ is $52$, but\n$IIL$ is not a valid Roman numeral.\n\nOne additional rule allows a letter to the left of a larger letter to\nsignify subtracting the smaller from the larger. For instance $IV$ is\n$4$. This can only be done once; $3$ is written $III$, not $IIV$. Also,\nit is generally required that the smaller letter be the one immediately\nsmaller than the larger, so $1999$ is usually written $MCMXCIX$, not\n$MIM$.\n\nIt is worth noting that today it is usually considered incorrect to\nrepeat a letter four times, so $IV$ is preferred to $IIII$. However many\nolder monuments do not use the subtraction rule at all, so $44$ was\nwritten $XXXXIIII$ instead of the now preferable $XLIV$.",
