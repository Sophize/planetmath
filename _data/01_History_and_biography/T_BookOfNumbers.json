  "definition": "The [*Book of Numbers*]{} is the fourth book of the [*Holy Bible*]{}.\nThe original Hebrew title is \u201cBa-Midbar\u201d, which means \u201cIn the Desert.\u201d\nIn the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the book was referred to\nas \u201cArithmoi\u201d, giving rise to its name in most modern languages. Chapter\n1 lists the results of the Census taken after the Jews escaped from\nEgypt, \u201cevery male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able\nto go forth to war,\u201d categorized by tribes (but the Levites were\nexcluded from the Census). In the King James Version, the numbers are\ngiven rounded off by hundreds.\n\n  ---------- -------------\n    Reuben   46500\n    Simeon   59300\n     Gad     5650\n    Judah    74600\n   Issachar  54400\n   Zebulun   57400\n   Ephraim   4500\n   Manasseh  32200\n   Benjamin  35400\n     Dan     62700\n    Asher    41500\n   Naphtali  53400\n     Levi    not counted\n  ---------- -------------\n\nUnlike other uses of numbers in the [*Bible*]{}, the numbers in the Book\nof Numbers are understood to be actual enumerations and not chosen for\ntheir symbolic value because of their mathematical or numerological\nproperties (as is the case with the Book of Revelations).\n\nThe title [*Book of Numbers*]{} was used by John Conway and Richard Guy\nfor their book on number theory. Title aside, it contains no biblical\nreferences.",
