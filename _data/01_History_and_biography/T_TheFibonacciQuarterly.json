  "definition": "[*The Fibonacci Quarterly*]{} (sometimes [*Fib. Quart.*]{} in\nbibliographies) is the official publication of the Fibonacci\nAssociation, intended \u201cto serve as a focal point for interest in\nFibonacci numbers and related questions, especially with respect to new\nresults, research proposals, challenging problems, and innovative proofs\nof old ideas.\u201d Published since 1962, it is available in hard copy from\nmost libraries as well as online.\n\nThe journal has its own editorial board, but the board of directors of\nthe Fibonacci Association also helps. Additionally, there is a rotating\ngroup of additional referees consisting of \u201cmathematicians, engineers\nand physicists\u201d; for example, the referees for [**42**]{} included Ron\nGraham, Jud McCranie, Carl Pomerance, and Samuel Wagstaff Jr, among a\ncouple dozen others.\n\nStarting with the February 2004 issue, the journal invites \u201cwell known\nmathematicians and scientists\u201d to write articles on how they \u201cuse\nFibonacci numbers, or similar recurrence sequences, in their research\nand writing.\u201d The first such article was by George Andrews on the\nFibonacci numbers and the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. Articles in the\njournal touch on various topics of different obviousness of relation to\nthe Fibonacci numbers, such as the Fibonacci fractions, the Collatz\nsequence, cryptography, etc.",
