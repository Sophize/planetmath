  "definition": "The [*abacus*]{} is a computational tool of ancient history. In its\nsimplest form, it is a frame with a number of rods, and on each rod\nthere are beads to represent numbers. Usually, the beads on the leftmost\nrod represent units, those on the second leftmost rod represent tens,\nthen hundreds, etc. The Chinese added a separator near the top, leaving\ntwo beads in the \u201cheaven\u201d part of the device to represent five of a\ngiven place value, e.g., a \u201cheaven\u201d bead on the third rod from the left\nrepresents 500 while a bead on the \u201cearth\u201d side of the same rod stands\nfor just 100. For calculations involving money, where the unit of\ncurrency is usually divided into a hundred cents, the two leftmost rods\ncan be used to represent the cent values while the third rod for the\nleft is then the unit rod.\n\n[1]{} J.
