  "definition": "[*The\u00a0Multiply Perfect Numbers Page*]{}, hosted by Bielefeld University,\nis currently the most up-to-date Webpage for information on multiply\nperfect numbers. Maintained by Achim Flammenkamp, this archive of more\nthan five thousand multiply perfect numbers \u201cgrew out\u201d of a similar\ndatabase of a little more than two thousand which Richard Schroeppel\ncompiled in 1995 but did not update any further.\n\nBecause multiply perfect numbers get very large very fast, it is\nactually not at all practical to archive a text representation of the\nnumbers written in a particular base. Instead, the archive gives the\nlogarithm of the logarithm, the number of distinct prime factors, the\nnumber of consecutive small factors, the exponents of the primes, etc.\n(in short, enough information to construct the base representation of a\ndesired multiply perfect number) plus historical information such as the\nname of the discoverer and the date of discovery.\n\nThe Multiply Perfect Numbers Page is at .",
