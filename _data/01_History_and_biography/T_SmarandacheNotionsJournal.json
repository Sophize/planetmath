  "definition": "The [*Smarandache Notions Journal*]{} is a publication devoted to\nFlorentin Smarandache\u2019s ideas about number theory and physics.\nOriginally called the [*Smarandache Function Journal*]{} (as it focused\non the Smarandache function), it changed to a more general title with\nVolume 7 and began to cover other mathematical topics studied by\nSmarandache. The editorial board of the journal consists mainly of\nRomanian mathematicians but Smarandache himself is excluded.\nContributors to Volume 7 include Henry Ibstedt, Florian Luca, and Y. V.\nChebrakov.\n\nAlthough it is available in hard copy, most libraries don\u2019t carry it.\nThe official home page does not make the journal navigable by issue\nnumber. The journal is occasionally cited by Mathworld, mainly in\nconnection to consecutive numbers.\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -",
