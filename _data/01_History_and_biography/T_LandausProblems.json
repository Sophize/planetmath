  "definition": "[*Landau\u2019s problems*]{} are four conjectures about prime numbers which\nwere unsolved at the time Edmund Landau presented on them at\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians of 1912.\n\n1.  Goldbach\u2019s conjecture\n\n2.  The twin prime conjecture\n\n3.  Legendre\u2019s conjecture\n\n4.  The conjecture that there are infinitely many primes of the form\n    $p = n^2 + 1$.\n\nUnlike similar collections of unsolved problems, this collection does\nnot include the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nAlmost a hundred years later, all four of Landau\u2019s problems are still\nunsolved.",
