  "definition": "Mathematics in Egypt: Mathematical Leather Roll (2014 Update)\n\nHenry Rhind purchased a 10\u2033 \u00d7 17\u2033 leather roll (Egyptian Mathematical\nLeather Roll, EMLR) and a mathematical papyrus (Rhind Mathematical\nPapyrus, RMP) in 1858 on the streets of Cairo, Egypt. Both texts date to\nthe Middle Kingdom (2050 BCE to 1550 BCE). Upon Henry Rhind\u2019s unexpected\ndeath, both texts were gifted to the British Museum in 1864 (Seyf, Hall,\n1927). The papyrus was published in 1879 in Germany, and reported as\ntranslated in the USA (Chace, 1927). In 1927 the EMLR was chemically\nsoftened, unrolled, and analyzed (Seyf, Hall, 1927).\n\nThe Middle Kingdom hieratic script was written right to left. There were\n26 rational numbers listed in a right column, followed by a series of\nequivalent unit fractions. There were ten binary rational numbers: 1/2,\n1/4 (twice), 1/8 (thrice), 1/16 (twice), 1/32, and 1/64. There were\nseven other even rational numbers: 1/6 (twice\u2014but wrong once), 1/10,\n1/12, 1/14, 1/20, and 1/30. There were also nine odd rational numbers:\n2/3, 1/3 (twice), 1/5, 1/7, 1/9, 1/11, 1/13, and 1/15.\n\nBritish Museum examiners found no description of how or why the\nequivalent unit fraction series were recorded (Gillings, 1972). There\nwas a trivial scribal error associated with the 1/15 unit fraction\nseries. The scribe mistakenly listed 1/6. A serious scribal error was\nassociated with the 1/13 line, a problem that the examiners did not\nresolve. Seyf and Hall (1927) naively reported in The British Museum\nQuarterly the chemical analysis was more interesting than the Egyptian\nmathematical leather roll\u2019s apparent singular focus on additive unit\nfraction relationships.\n\nNearby Babylonian scribes used an infinite series base 60 system 1,000\nyears before finite Egyptian numeration statements appeared. Babylonians\ngained numerical accuracy by minimizing round-offs to 1/3,600 for two\nterms, and 1/216,000 for. Babylonian inverse prime number tables used\nfor dividing fractions by fractions rounded off and degraded an intended\nhigh accuracy (Campbell-Kelly, et al, 2003).\n\nThe Egyptian binary fractions were restatements of and improvements to\nthe Old Kingdom Horus-Eye infinite series system. The Egyptian system\nasked a \u201cdecimal fraction\u201d numeration question: How can a Horus-Eye\nrepresentation for the number one (1)\u2014and all other numbers\u2014that rounded\noff a seventh 1/64 term be represented by an exact unit fraction series?\n\nProperties of infinite and finite Egyptian arithmetic were similar to\nthose contained in our modern decimal system (Ore, 1948). Modern\nresearchers, since 1927, minimize the EMLR\u2019s significance as a teaching\ndocument by overlooking non-additive aspects of the student test paper.\nHorus-Eye round off errors were implicitly corrected in the EMLR. But\ndid the EMLR demonstrate that unit fractions were always intended to be\nrecorded as exact unit fraction series?\n\nProbing the intent of the text, EMLR examiners suggested that the 26\nlines only contained simple additive information. Five modern arithmetic\ncategories freshly parsed the EMLR\u2019s 26 unit fraction series in 2004.\nThe first four additive categories were understood in 1927. However, a\nnon-additive fifth category, proposed to have been an algebraic\nidentity, included single and double least common multiples (LCM) that\nimplicitly scaled unit fractions to smaller unit fraction series\n(Gardner, 2004).\n\nToday it is clear that the fifth 2004 category was not intended to be an\nalgebraic identity. The EMLR student scribe actually scaled 1/8 by two\nsingle-LCMs: (3/3) and (5/5), and one double-LCM: (25/25), (6/6). The\nthree EMLR alternative 1/8 series did not include shorthand notes. A\nmodern translation of the scribal data therefore adds-back scribal\nintermediate steps that are consistent with scribal shorthand used in\nthe AWT and RMP.\n\n1\\. 1/8 (3/3) = 3/24 = (2 + 1)/24 = 1/12 + 1/24\n\n2\\. 1/8(5/5) = 5/40 = (4 + 1)/40 = 1/10 + 1/40\n\n3\\. 1/8(25/25) = 25/200 = (8 + 17)/200 = 1/25 + 17/200 such that\n\n17/200(6/6) = 102/1200 = (80 + 16 + 6)/1200 meant\n\n1/8 = 1/25 + 1/15 + 1/75 + 1/200\n\nThe third 2-LCM method could not have been built by a 1-LCM since\n\na\\. (1/8 - 1/25) = (25 - 8)/200 = 17/200 = (10 + 5 + 2)/200=\n\n1/8 = 1/25 + 1/20 + 1/40 + 1/100\n\nb\\. (1/8 - 1/25) = (25 - 8)/200 = 17/200 = (8 + 5 + 4)/200 =\n\n1/8 = 1/25 + 1/25 + 1/40 + 1/50 must solve\n\n2/25(3/3) = 6/100 = (5 + 1)/100 = 1/25 + 1/75 + 1/100\n\n1/8 = 1/15 + 1/40 + 1/50 + 1/75\n\nThe sequence of the actual EMLR 1/8 unit fraction series was first\nscaled by (25/25) in the third two 2-LCM method has been confirmed by 60\nRMP examples and five Akhmim Wooden Tablet (AWT) examples.\n\nThe AWT is housed in the main Cairo, Egypt museum scaled a hekat (a\nvolume unit) by double-LCMs to record 1/64 quotents and 1/320 of a hekat\nsub-unit. That is, RMP and AWT hekat quotients scaled a hekat unity\n(64/64) when multiplied by 1/3, 1/7, 1/10, 1/11, 1/13 and 1/n. The\n(64/64)/n remainder was scaled by LCM 5/5 to 1/320th of a hekat unit was\ncalled ro (Vymazalova, 2002; Gardner, 2006). The RMP and AWT scribal\nshorthand was subtle, and therefore was also misread for over 110 years.\nTwo corrected translations of the 1/3 and 1/10 scribal longhand cases\nmakes subtle points:\n\n1\\. (64/64) (1/3) = 21/64 + (1/192)(5/5) = (16 + 4 + 1)/64 + 5/3(1/320) =\n\n1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + (1 + 2/3) ro\n\n2\\. (64/64)(1/10) = 6/64 + 1/640(5/5) = (4 + 2)/64 + 20/10(1/320) =\n\n1/16 + 1/32 + 2 ro\n\nSpecific common EMLR and RMP rational number conversion methods were not\naccurately parsed in a scribal manner during the 20th century. Scholars\nreported scribal division as \u201cfalse position\u201d guesses (Chace, 1927,\nEves, 1961). Scholarly citations of \u201dfalse position\u201d showed only that\nscholars guessed. No scribal or scholarly form of \u201cfalse position\u201d\nguessing has been implicitly or explicitly connected to the EMLR, RMP,\nor the AWT.\n\nGiven that the EMLR recorded no intermediate calculations, no implicit\nproof of \u201cfalse position\u201d division guessing can be found. Concerning the\n65 RMP and AWT examples not one explicit or implicit scribal use of\n\u201cfalse position\u201d was found. What was found: the division of fractions\n1/n by a second fraction 1/p first scaled 1/n by (m/m) to m/mn so that\nm/mnp was recorded 65 times to concise unit fraction series (that summed\nthe best divisors of denominator mnp often by red auxiliary numbers to\nnumerator mm in ways that 19th and 20th scholars failed to decode). In\nsix cases, all five AWT problems and RMP 38, proofs inverted divisor 1/p\nto p/1 such that m/mnp times p/1 returned 1/n (Gardner, 2006, M.\nGardner, 2008).\n\nIn summary, the EMLR\u2019s 26 lines of text responded to the same infinite\nseries question, found an exact unit fraction series for each unit\nfraction, when needed. Concerning details, the EMLR student scaled Horus\nEye (binary), composite and prime unit fractions by single and double\nLCMs (m/m) to concise and awkward exact unit fraction series. EMLR data\nreported finite series without 1920s scholarly induced \u201cfalse position\u201d\nguesses that were misreported with respect to the AWT, the RMP and other\ntexts. That is, the EMLR implied when contrasted to the AWT and RMP that\nscribal division and proofs inverted divisors and multiplied in the\nmodern arithmetic operation manner .\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.
