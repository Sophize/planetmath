  "definition": "Scaling aspects of hekat sub-divisions were reported in Rhind\nMathematical Papyrus (RMP) 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, the Kahun\nPapyrus, and the Northumberland Papyri 1, 2 and 3. To correct confusing\nscribal partitions of the hekat, muddled by 1920s scholars accepted\nuntil 1999 by Clagett and others by reporting transliterations as\ntranslations, please consider:\n\n!. In RMP 43 and the Kahun Papyrus a scribal volume formula was well\ndefined by:\n\nV = (2/3)(H)\\[(4/3)(4/3)(D)(D)\\] (khar)\n\n2\\. Ahmes mentioned a 400-hekat unit and/or a conflicting (and possibly\nequivalent) 100-hekat unit by multiplying a khar unit by 1/20. In RMP\n41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 Ahmes mixed hieratic symbols related to\n400-hekat and 100-hekat units. Which one was the correct unit?\n\n3\\. In RMP 47 a mixed table calculated 100 (1-hekat) quotients, matched\nwith(1-ro) remainders, and 100 (4-hekat) quotients matched with (4-ro)\nremainders of Ahmes\u2019 shorthand notes reported muddled quotients in\nbinary fractions and remainders scaled to ro, 1/320 of (1- hekat) and\n(4-hekat). Clagett\u2019s data paired (4-hekat) quotients with (1-ro)\nremainders is corrected by:\n\n1/10 = 10 (1-hekat)\n\n1/20 = 5 (1-hekat)\n\n1/30 = (3 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64) (1-hekat) + (1 + 2/3)(1-ro)\n\n1/40 = 2 1/2 (4-hekat)\n\n1/50 = 2 (4-hekat)\n\n1/60 = 1 1/2 1/8 1/32 (4-hekat) + (3 1/3) (4-ro )\n\n1/70 = 1 1/4 1/8 1/32 1/64 (4-hekat) + (2 1/14 1/21) (4-ro)\n\n1/80 = 1 1/4 (4-hekat)\n\n1/90 = 1 1/16 1/32 1/64 (4-hekat) + 1/2 1/18 (4-ro)\n\n1/100 = 1 (4-hekat)\n\nshowed in 2014 that the MMP partitioned 5 (4-hekat), 10 (4-hekat), 20\n(4-hekat) and 40 (4-hekat) by 2/3. For example 20 (4-hekat) mulltiplied\nby 2/3 = (16 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64)(4-hekat) (1 + 2/3) (4-ro) meant that the\n(1-hekat) partitions by 1/n required (1-ro )remainders, and (4-hekat)\npartitions by 1/n required (4-ro) remainders, with al other fractional\nfacts remained unchanged.\n\n4\\. Correcting transliterated data, by adding back scribal omissions,\nmust consider one hekat written as (64/64), as reported by Hana\nVymazalova as a hekat unity, per: to obtain translations to modern\narithemtic:\n\na\\. (64/64)/n = Q/64 + (5R/n)ro\n\na formula proven in the 1925 BCE Akhmim Wooden Tablet. The formula was\napplied in the RMP over 40 times.\n\nb\\. Proceed to RMP 47 in line 7, the 1/70 case, Clagett\u2019s transliteration\nerror was numerically corrected by Robins-Shute, 1987, without citing\nthe AWT formula. Corrected raw data states:\n\n(2 + 1/14 + 1/21+ 1/42)hekat\n\nc\\. translated into modern arithmetic by adding back scribal calculations\nsuch that\n\n(150/70)ro = (2 + 1/7)ro\n\nreported a 1/7 sentence:\n\n1/7 = 1/7(6/6) = 6/42 = (3 + 2 + 1)/42 = 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42\n\nThe complete scribal calculations started at the beginning says:\n\n(6400/64) x 1/70 = 91/64 + 30/4480 in modern arithmetic and\n\n(64 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1)/64 hekat + (150/70)ro in scribal arithmetic,\nciting\n\n(1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/32)hekat + (2 + 1/14 + 1/21 + 1/42)ro\n\na corrected modern and ancient arithmetic answer.\n\nd\\. Ahmes mixed 400-hekat and 100-hekat quotient and remainder notations\nin RMP 47. The situation caused Peet, Chace, Robins-Shute and others to\nreport muddled transliterated data. Ahmes encoded 400-hekat\nmultiplications by 1/10 and 1/20 and 100-hekat multiplications by 1/30,\n1/40, 1/50, 1/60, 1/70, 1/80, 1/90 and 1/100 in ways that require\ncorrections when writing equivalent modern arithmetic statements.\n\nAdding back initial scribal data was mentioned by Tanja Pemmerening in\n2002 and 2006, a rigorous point of view that stresses modern metric\nscalings is also corrected to ancient scaling formulas by applying a\nmodified AWT formula\n\n4 x (6400/64) x 1/n = (Q/64)4-hekat + (5R/n)4-ro\n\nRMP 47\u2019s ancient formulas (by myself) and metric units (by Tanja\nPemmerening) are fairly decoded by:\n\n1/10 = (10)4-hekat = (4800 x 4 x 10) = 192000 cc\n\n1/20 = (5)4-hekat = (4800 x 4 x 5) = 96000 cc\n\n1/30 = (3 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64)4-hekat + (1 + 2/3)4-ro = (57600 + 4800 +\n1200 + 300 + 60 + 40) = 64000 cc\n\n1/40 = (2 + 1/2)4-hekat = (38400 + 9600) = 48000 cc\n\n1/50 = (2) 4-hekat = (4800 x 4 x 2) = 38400 cc\n\n1/60 = (1 + 1/2 + 1/8+ 1/32)4-hekat + (3 + 1/3)4-ro = (19200 + 9600 +\n2400 + 600 + 180 + 20) = 32000 cc\n\n1/70 = (1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64)4-hekat + (2 + 1/14 + 1/21 +\n1/42)4-ro =(19200 + 4800 + 2400 + 600 + 300 + 120 + 8 + 4/7) = 27428 +\n4/7 cc\n\n1/80 = (1 + 1/4)4-hekat =(19200 + 4800) = 24000 cc\n\n1/90 = (1 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64)4-hekat + (1/2 + 1/18)4-ro = (19200 +\n1200 + 600 + 300 + 30 + 3 + 1/3) = 21333 + 1/3 cc\n\n1/100 = (1)4-hekat = (4800 x 4) = 19200 cc\n\n5\\. Additional scribal light can be shed on the 4-hekat issue by\nconsidering economic 4-sack shipping units recorded in Northumberland\nPapyri 1, 2 and 3 published by Barns and Gunn, 1948. Quadruple-sack and\nquadruple-hekat units were monitored into 4-hekat units of grain bread\nunits and did not mix 4-hekat quotients with 1-ro remainders. Balanced\n(4-hekat + 4-ro) quotient or remainders or (1-hekat + 1-ro) quotients\nand remainders were recorded by Ahmes. RMP 47 seemed to mix these two\nmutually exclusive methods. Ahmes correctly reported khar divided by 20\ninto 400-hekat with 4-ro remainders, and did not intended 1-ro\nremainders to be understood. Clagett was one of many scholars that have\nimproperly recorded 400-hekat quotients and 1-ro remainders within the\nsame statements. Scribes recorded 400-hekat and 100-hekat divisions by\nrational numbers (that were inverted and multiplied). Answers can be\ncorrectly translated as one hekat = 4800 ccm; 1/10 of a hekat (hin)= 480\nccm; 4-ro = 60 ccm; and 1-ro = 15 ccm. Scholars that stress\ntransliterations rather than translations often associated 4-hekat\nquotients with 1-ro remainders, rather than the correct 4-hekat quotient\nwith the correct 4-ro remainders.\n\n6\\. G. Reference (2) Marshall Clagett, 1999, Egyptian Science and\nMathematics (Volume III) includes Chace\u2019s 1927 views of the RMP, as well\nas transliterations of the Kahun Papyrus, the Moscow Mathematical\nPapyrus. The valid transliterations should not be considered complete\ntranslations. Missing initial and intermediate arithmetic steps were not\nparsed, and inserted, as well as the other mathematics, i.e. the\nattested arithmetic operations used by all Middle Kingdom scribes, info\nrequired to prepare complete translations.\n\n[10]{}\n\nA.B.
