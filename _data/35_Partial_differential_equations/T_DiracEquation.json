  "definition": "The Dirac equation is an equation derived by Paul Dirac in 1927 that\ndescribes relativistic spin $1/2$ particles (fermions). It is given by:\n$$(\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - im)\\psi = 0$$ The Einstein summation\nconvention is used.\n\nDerivation\n----------\n\nMathematically, it is interesting as one of the first uses of the spinor\ncalculus in mathematical physics. Dirac began with the relativistic\nequation of total energy: $$E = \\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4}$$ As Schr\u00f6dinger\nhad done before him, Dirac then replaced $p$ with its quantum mechanical\noperator, $\\hat{p} \\Rightarrow i\\hbar \\nabla$. Since he was looking for\na Lorentz-invariant equation, he replaced $\\nabla$ with the\nD\u2019Alembertian or wave operator\n$$\\Box = \\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}$$ Note\nthat some authors use $\\Box^2$ for the D\u2019Alembertian. Dirac was now\nfaced with the problem of how to take the square root of an expression\ncontaining a differential operator. He proceeded to factorise the\nd\u2019Alembertian as follows:\n$$\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} = (a^0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + a^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + a^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} + a^3\\frac{i}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})^2$$\nMultiplying this out, we find that:\n$$(a^0)^2 = (a^1)^2 = (a^2)^2 = (a^3)^2 = 1$$ And\n$$a^0a^1 + a^1a^0 = a^0a^2 + a^2a^0 = a^0a^3 + a^3a^0 = a^1a^2 + a^2a^1 = a^1a^3 + a^3a^1 = a^2a^3 + a^3a^2 = 0$$\nClearly these relations cannot be satisfied by scalars, so Dirac sought\na set of four matrices which satisfy these relations. These are now\nknown as the Dirac matrices, and are given as follows:\n$$\\gamma^0 = -ia^0 = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\gamma^1 = -ia^1 = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$ $$\\gamma^2 = -ia^2 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & -i \\\\\n0 & 0 & i & 0 \\\\\n0 & i & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-i & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\gamma^3 = a^3 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$ These matrices are also known as the\ngenerators of the special unitary group of order 4, i.e. the group of\n$4 \\times 4$ matrices with unit determinant. Using these matrices, and\nswitching to natural units ($\\hbar = c = 1$) we can now obtain the Dirac\nequation: $$(\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - im)\\psi = 0$$\n\nFeynman slash notation\n----------------------\n\nRichard Feynman developed the following convenient notation for terms\ninvolving Dirac matrices: $$\\gamma^\\mu q_\\mu := \\cancel{q}$$ Using this\nnotation, the Dirac equation is simply\n$$(\\cancel{\\partial} - im)\\psi = 0$$\n\nRelationship with Pauli matrices\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Dirac matrices can be written more concisely as matrices of Pauli\nmatrices, as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\gamma_0 &= \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_0 & 0\\\\\n                            0 & -\\sigma_0\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\gamma_1 &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma_1\\\\\n                            -\\sigma_1 & 0\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\gamma_2 &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma_2\\\\\n                            -\\sigma_2 & 0\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\\\\n\\gamma_3 &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma_3\\\\\n                            -\\sigma_3 & 0\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}$$",
