  "statement": "Let $E\\subset W$ where $E$ is an open subset of $W$ which is a normed\nvector space, and let $f$ be a continuous differentiable map\n$$f: E \\to W.$$ Then the ordinary differential equation defined as\n$$\\dot{x} = f(x)$$ with the initial condition $$x(0) = x_0$$ where\n$x_0 \\in E$ has a unique solution on some interval containing zero. More\nspecifically there exists $\\alpha>0$ such that the following is a unique\nfunction $$x:(-\\alpha,\\alpha) \\to E$$ such that $\\dot{x}=f\\circ x$ and\n$x(0)=x_0$.[@HS]\n\n[1]{} Hirsch, W.
