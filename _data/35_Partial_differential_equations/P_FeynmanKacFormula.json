  "statement": "Let $X_t$ be the $n$-dimensional It\u014d process satisfying the stochastic\ndifferential equation $$dX_t = \\mu(X_t) \\, dt + \\sigma(X_t) \\, dW_t$$\nand let $A$ be its infinitesimal generator.\n\nFurther suppose that $q$ is a lower-bounded continuous function on\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, and $f$ is a twice-differentiable function on\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ with compact support. Then\n$$u(t,x) = {\\mathbb{E}}\\bigl[ e^{-\\int_0^t q(X_s) \\, ds} \\, f(X_t) \\mid X_0 = x \\bigr]\\,,\n\\quad t\\geq 0\\,, x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$$ is a solution to the partial\ndifferential equation\n$${\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}} = Au(x) - uq(x)$$ with initial\ncondition $u(0, x) = f(x)$.\n\n(The expectation for $u$ is to be taken with respect to the probability\nmeasure under which $W_t$ is a Brownian motion.)\n\n[9]{} Bernt \u00d8ksendal.
