  "definition": "Let $P$ be a partial differential operator defined in an open subset\n$U \\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^n$. If for every $u$ defined in an open subset\n$V \\subset U$ such that $Pu$ is $C^\\infty$ (smooth), $u$ must also be\n$C^\\infty$, then $P$ is called [*hypoelliptic*]{}.\n\nSimilarly, if the same assertion holds with $C^\\infty$ replaced by real\nanalytic, then $P$ is said to be [*analytically hypoelliptic*]{}.\n\nNote that some authors use \u201chypoelliptic\u201d to mean \u201canalytically\nhypoelliptic.\u201d Hence, if it is not clear from context, it is best to\nspecify the regularity when using the term. For example,\n$C^\\infty$-hypoelliptic instead of just hypoelliptic.\n\n[9]{} J. Barros-Neto, Ralph A. Artino. [**]{}, Lecture Notes in Pure and\nApplied Mathematics, 53.
