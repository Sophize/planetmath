Furthermore consider the\nordinary differential equation $$\\dot{x} = f(x)$$ with the initial\ncondition\n\n$x(0) = x_0$.\n\nLet $x(t)$ be the solution of the above initial value problem defined as\n$$x:I \\to E$$ where $I = [-a,a]$. Then there exist $\\delta >0$ such that\nfor all $y_0 \\in N_\\delta (x_0)$*($y_0$ in the $\\delta$ neighborhood of\n$x_0$)* has a unique solution $y(t)$ to the initial value problem above\nexcept for the initial value changed to $x(0)=y_0$. In addition $y(t)$\nis twice continouously differentialble function of $t$ over the interval\n$I$.",
