  "definition": "The *Korteweg - de Vries equation* is a partial differential equation\ndefined as $$u_t + 6u u_x + u_{xxx} = 0$$ where $u = u(x,t)$ and the\nsubscripts indicate derivatives. This equation arises in hydrodynamics\nand was originally proposed to model waves in a canal. In addition to\nits practical applications, this equation is quite interesting as an\nobject of mathematical study. It exhibits interesting soliton solutions,\nhas a large algebra of conserved quantities, and can be solved using\nmethods of inverse scattering.\n\nTravelling Wave Solution\n========================\n\nIt is easy to exhibit a solution which describes a traveling wave. To\nfind this solution, one substitutes the ansatz $u(x,t)=f(x-ct)$ [^1]\ninto the equation to obtain the following equation for $f$:\n$$-cf' + 6f f' + f''' = 0$$ This equation can be written as\n$$(-cf + 3 f^2 + f'')' = 0$$ and, hence, $$-cf + 3 f^2 + f'' = k$$ for\nsome constant $k$. Multiplying by $f'$, we can repeat the same trick:\n$$-cff' + 3 f^2 f' + f'f'' - kf' =\n(-cf^2/2 + f^3 + (f')^2 - kf)' = 0$$ hence\n$$-cf^2/2 + f^3 + (f')^2 - kf = h$$ or\n$$f' = \\sqrt{ kf + cf^2/2 - f^3}$$ This can be solved implicitly by an\nintegral: $$y = \\int^{f(y)} \\sqrt{ kf + cf^2/2 - f^3} \\,dy + C$$ Since\nthis is an elliptic integral, the result is an elliptic function.\n\nThe solution obtained above is know as a *solitary wave*, or *soliton*.\nThis term \u201csolitary wave\u201d refers to the fact that this solution\ndescribes a single wave pulse traveling with velocity $c$. Note that the\namplitude of the pulse is determined by its velocity, unlike in the case\nof linear wave equations where the velocity of propagation does not\ndepend upon the amplitude. There are also solutions which describe more\nthan one solitary wave. In particular, there are solutions in which two\nof these waves collide and then re-emerge from the collision.\n\nConserved Currents\n==================\n\nIt is possible to exhibit integrals whose value is conserved under the\nevolution. To construct these quantities, we begin with vector fields.\nSuppose that $u$ is a thrice differentiable function of $x$ and $t$ and\nconsider the following vector fields: $$\\begin{aligned}\n v^{(1)} &= (u, 3 u^2 + u_{xx})  \\\\\n v^{(2)} &= (u^2, 4 u^3 - u_x^2 + 2 u u_{xx})\\end{aligned}$$ Computing\ntheir divergences and rearranging the result, $$\\begin{aligned}\n {\\partial v^{(1)}_t \\over \\partial t} +\n {\\partial v^{(1)}_t \\over \\partial x} &=\n u_{t} + 6 u u_x + u_{xxx} \\\\\n {\\partial v^{(2)}_t \\over \\partial t} +\n {\\partial v^{(2)}_t \\over \\partial x} &=\n 2 u (u_t + 6 u u_x + u_{xxx}) .\\end{aligned}$$ If $u$ happens to\nsatisfy our differential equation, then the divergence of these vector\nfields will go zero.\n\nTo obtain the conserved quantities, we will integrate them over a\nrectangle in the $t,x$ plane with sides parallel to the $x$ and $t$ axes\nuse Green\u2019s theorem . $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\,\n &(u_{t}(t,x) + 6 u(t,x) u_x(t,x) + u_{xxx}(t,x)) \\\\ = \n &\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, (3 u^2(x,t_2) + u_{xx}(x,t_2)) +\n \\int_{t_2}^{t_1} dt \\, u(t,x_2) + \\\\\n &\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, (3 u^2(x,t_1) + u_{xx}(x,t_1)) +\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u(t,x_1) \\\\ =\n &3 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, u^2(x,t_2) -\n 3 \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, u^2(x,t_1) \\\\ +\n &\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u(t,x_1) -\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u(t,x_2) +\n u_x(x_2,t_2) - u_x(x_1,t_2) - u_x(x_2,t_1) + u_x(x_1,t_1) \\\\\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\,\n &2 u (u_{t}(t,x) + 6 u(t,x) u_x(t,x) + u_{xxx}(t,x)) \\\\ = \n &\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, (4 u^3(x,t_2) - u_x^2(x,t_2) + 2 u(x,t_2) u_{xx}(x,t_2)) +\n \\int_{t_2}^{t_1} dt \\, u^2(t,x_2) + \\\\\n &\\int_{x_2}^{x_2} dx \\, (4 u^3(x,t_1) - u_x^2(x,t_1) + 2 u(x,t_1) u_{xx}(x,t_1)) +\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u^2(t,x_1) \\\\ =\n &\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, (4 u^3(x,t_2) - 3 u_x^2(x,t_2)) -\n \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, (4 u^3(x,t_1) - 3 u_x^2(x,t_1)) \\\\ +\n &\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u^2(t,x_1) -\n \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dt \\, u^2(t,x_2) \\\\ +\n &u(x_2,t_2) u_x(x_2,t_2) - u (x_1,t_2) u_x(x_1,t_2) - \n u(x_2,t_1) u_x(x_2,t_1) + u(x_1,t_1) u_x(x_1,t_1)\\end{aligned}$$ We\nconsider now several popular boundary conditions for our equation:\n\n-   [**Periodic**]{} Suppose that $u$ is periodic in $x$ with period $p$\n    and satisfies the Kortwieg - de Vries equation. Then we integrals\n    over $t$ cancel against each other as do the endpoint terms, leaving\n    us with $$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, u^2(x,t_1) = \n     \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\, u^2(x,t_2).$$\n\n-   [**Whole line**]{} Suppose that $u$ satisfies the Kortwieg - de\n    Vries equation and that $u$ and its derivatives tend towards zero as\n    $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. Then, taking the limit as $x_1 \\to -\\infty$ and\n    $x_2 \\to + \\infty$, we conclude that\n    $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} dx \\, u^2(x,t_1) = \n     \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} dx \\, u^2(x,t_2) .$$\n\n-   [Finite interval]{} We may also consider our differential equation\n    on a finite interval and impose suitable boundary conditions at the\n    endpoints. In this case, the integrals with respect to $t$ do not\n    cancel or automatically vanish as a consequence of the boundary\n    conditions, so they will not, in general, give conserved quantities.\n    Nevertheless, it is at least still possible to compute their value\n    solely from the boundary data without having to know how the\n    solution behaves in the interior.\n\nStarting with the two vector fields given above, it is possible to\ngenerate more such vector fields and more conserved quantities. Since\nthe Lie bracket of two vector fields with zero divergence also has zero\ndivergence, we may\n\n[^1]: The most general form of a solution to the two-dimensional wave\n    equation is $u(x,t) = f(x-ct) + f(x+ct)$ which describes waves\n    propagating in both directions with velocity $c$. Here, we will look\n    for a solution which only describes a wave propagatng in one\n    direction.",
