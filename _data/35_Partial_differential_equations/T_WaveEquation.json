  "definition": "The *wave equation* is a partial differential equation which describes\ncertain kinds of waves. It arises in various physical situations, such\nas vibrating , waves, and electromagnetic waves.\n\nThe wave equation in one is\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}=c^2\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial\n  x^2}.$$ The general solution of the one-dimensional wave equation can\nbe obtained by a change of coordinates:\n$(x,t)\\longrightarrow(\\xi,\\eta)$, where $\\xi=x-ct$ and $\\eta=x+ct$. This\ngives $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial\\xi\\partial\\eta}=0$, which we can\nintegrate to get *d\u2019Alembert\u2019s solution*: $$u(x,t)=F(x-ct)+G(x+ct)$$\nwhere $F$ and $G$ are twice differentiable functions. $F$ and $G$\nrepresent waves traveling in the positive and negative $x$ directions,\nrespectively, with velocity $c$. These functions can be obtained if\nappropriate initial conditions and boundary conditions are given. For\nexample, if $u(x,0)=f(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)=g(x)$\nare given, the solution is\n$$u(x,t)=\\frac{1}{2}[f(x-ct)+f(x+ct)]+\\frac{1}{2c}\\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct}g(s)\\mathrm d s.$$\n\nIn general, the wave equation in $n$ is\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}=c^2\\nabla^2 u.$$ where $u$ is a\nfunction of the location variables $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$, and time $t$.\nHere, $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian with respect to the location\nvariables, which in Cartesian coordinates is given by $\n\\nabla^2=\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_1^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_2^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_n^2}$.",
