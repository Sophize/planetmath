  "definition": "A soliton is a non-linear object which moves through space without\ndispersion at constant speed. They occur naturally as solutions to the\nKorteweg - de Vries equation. They were first observed by John Scott\nRussell in the 19th century and then by Martin Kruskal and Norman\nZabusky (who coined the term soliton) in a famous computer simulation in\n1965. Insight into solitons can be obtained by noting that the Korteweg\n- de Vries equation satisfies D\u2019Alembert\u2019s solution:\n$$u(x, t) = f(x-ct) + g(x+ct)$$ We see at once that this satisfies two\nimportant criteria: it has a constant velocity $c$, and it can also be\nshown that the two functions $f$ and $g$ can collide without altering\nshape. Solitons also occur in non-linear optics and as solutions to\nfield equations in quantum field theory.",
