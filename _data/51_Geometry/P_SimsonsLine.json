Then the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from P to the sides\n$AB,BC,CA$ (or their prolongations) are collinear.\n\n![image](simson.eps)\n\nIn the picture, the line passing through $U,V,W$ is a Simson line for\n$\\triangle ABC$.\n\nAn interesting result form the realm of analytic geometry states that\nthe envelope formed by Simson\u2019s lines when P varies is a circular\nhypocycloid of three points.\n\n![image](simson-env)",
