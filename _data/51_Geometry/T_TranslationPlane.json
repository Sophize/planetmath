  "definition": "Let $\\pi$ be a projective plane. Recall that a central collineation on\n$\\pi$ is a collineation $\\rho$ with a center $C$ and an axis $\\ell$. It\nis well-known that $C$ and $\\ell$ are uniquely determined. We also call\n$\\rho$ a $(C,\\ell)$-collineation.\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\pi$ be a projective plane. We say that $\\pi$ is\n*$(C,\\ell)$-transitive* if there is a point $C$ and a line $\\ell$, such\nthat for any points $P,Q$ where\n\n-   $P,Q$ and $C$ are collinear and pairwise distinct,\n\n-   $P,Q\\notin \\ell$,\n\nthere is a $(C,\\ell)$-collineation $\\rho$ such that $\\rho(P)=Q$.\n\nIt can be shown that $\\pi$ if $(C,\\ell)$-transitive iff it is\n$(C,\\ell)$-Desarguesian; that is, if two triangles are perspective from\npoint $C$, then they are perspective from line $\\ell$. From this, it is\neasy to see that $\\pi$ is a Desarguesian plane iff it is\n$(C,\\ell)$-transitive for any point $C$ and any line $\\ell$, of $\\pi$.\n\nNow, suppose that $C$ lies on $\\ell$. Then one can show that $\\pi$ is\n$(C,\\ell)$-transitive iff it can be coordinatized by a linear ternary\nring $R$ such that $R$ is a group with respect to the derived operation\n$+$ (addition). When $\\pi$ is so coordinatized, $\\ell$ is the line at\ninfinity, and $C$ is the point whose coordinate is $(\\infty)$.\n\nThis group is not necessarily abelian. So what condition(s) must be\nimposed on $\\pi$ so that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group? The answer lies in\nthe next definition:\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\pi$ be a projective plane. $\\pi$ is said to be\n$(m,\\ell)$-transitive if there are lines $m,\\ell$ such that $\\pi$ is\n$(C,\\ell)$-transitive for all $C\\in m$.\n\n**Definition**. A projective plane $\\pi$ is a *translation plane* if\nthere is a line $\\ell$ such that $\\pi$ is $(\\ell,\\ell)$-transitive. We\nalso say that $\\pi$ is a translation plane with respect to $\\ell$. The\nline $\\ell$ is called a *translation line* of $\\pi$.\n\nIt can be shown that $\\pi$ is a translation plane with respect to $\\ell$\niff it can be coordinatized by a Veblen-Wedderburn system (thus implying\nthat $(R,+)$ is abelian).\n\nWhen $\\pi$ is a translation plane with respect to two distinct lines\n$\\ell$ and $m$, then it is not hard to see that it is a translation\nplane with respect to every line passing through $\\ell\\cap m$.\n\nWhen $\\pi$ is a translation plane with respect to three non-concurrent\nlines, then it is a translation plane with respect to every line. A\nprojective plane which is a translation plane with respect to every line\nis called a Moufang plane. An example of a translation plane that is not\nMoufang is the Hall plane, coordinatized by the Hall quasifield. An\nexample of a projective plane that is not a translation plane is the\nHughes plane.\n\n**Remark**. There are also duals to the notions above: a projective\nplane $\\pi$ is\n\n1.  *$(P,Q)$-transitive* if there are points $P,Q$ such that $\\pi$ is\n    $(P,m)$-transitive for any line $m$ passing through $Q$.\n\n2.  a *dual translation plane* if there is a point $P$ such that $\\pi$\n    is $(P,P)$-transitive. We also say that $\\pi$ is a dual translation\n    plane with respect to $P$, and that $P$ is a *translation point* of\n    $\\pi$.\n\nIf $\\pi$ is a projective plane, then the following are true:\n\n-   $\\pi$ is translation plane with respect to some line $\\ell$ and a\n    dual translation plane with respect to some $P\\in \\ell$ iff $\\pi$\n    can be coordinatized by a semifield. In this coordinatization,\n    $\\ell$ is the line at infinity and $P$ is the point with coordinate\n    $(\\infty)$.\n\n-   $\\pi$ is translation plane with respect to some line $PQ$ and\n    $(P,Q)$- and $(Q,P)$-transitive iff $\\pi$ can be coordinatized by a\n    nearfield. In this coordinatization, $PQ$ is the line at infinity\n    where $P$ and $Q$ have coordinates $(0)$ and $(\\infty)$ (or vice\n    versa).\n\n**Remark**. By removing the line at infinity from a translation plane,\nwe obtain an *affine translation plane*. By the definition of a\ntranslation plane, an affine translation plane can be characterized as\nan affine plane where the minor affine Desarguesian property holds.\n\n[7]{} R.
