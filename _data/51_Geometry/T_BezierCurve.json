  "definition": "Introduction\n============\n\nB\u00e9zier curves are a particular family of curves in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ that\nparameterize a smooth path given points. They are often used to model or\napproximate general curved shapes because of their algebraic simplicity.\n\nB\u00e9zier curves were originally developed by Paul de Casteljau in 1959.\nBut it became a famous shape only when Pierre B\u00e9zier, a French engineer\nat Renault, used it to automobiles in the 1970\u2019s. They are now widely\nused in many such as industrial and computer-aided , vector-based\ndrawing, font design, and 3D modeling.\n\nDefinition\n==========\n\nGiven $n+1$ points $\\boldsymbol{P}_i$ in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, the *B\u00e9zier\ncurve* for these *control points* is the curve\n$\\boldsymbol{B} \\colon [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ defined by\n$$\\boldsymbol{B}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{i} (1-t)^{n-i} \\, t^i \\: \\boldsymbol{P}_i\\,.$$\nThe coefficients in this expression:\n$$b_{i,n}(t) = \\binom{n}{i} (1-t)^{n-i} \\, t^i \\,, \\quad  i=0,\\ldots, n\\,.$$\nare the Bernstein basis polynomials.\n\nSpecial cases\n=============\n\nA B\u00e9zier curve between two control points is simply the line segment\nbetween the two points:\n$$\\boldsymbol{B}(t) = (1-t) \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_0  +  t \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_1\\,.$$\n\nFor three control points, we have the quadratic B\u00e9zier curve:\n$$\\boldsymbol{B}(t) = (1-t)^2 \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_0  +  2 t (1-t) \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_1 +  t^2 \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_2\\,.$$\n\nFor four control points, we have the cubic B\u00e9zier curve:\n$$\\boldsymbol{B}(t) =  (1-t)^3 \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_0 +  3 t (1-t)^2 \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_1 + 3 t^2 (1-t) \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_2 + t^3\\,  \\boldsymbol{P}_3\\,.$$\n\nThese are the most commonly employed versions of B\u00e9zier curves.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n-   Except for the first and the last points, where the curve starts and\n    ends, the B\u00e9zier curve should not pass through any of the control\n    points. i.e. all the controls points lie on the curve if and only if\n    the curve is a straight line.\n\n-   The curve is tangent to the segment of line\n    $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{P}_0 \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_1}$ at the start and\n    $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{P}_{n-1} \\, \\boldsymbol{P}_n}$ at the end.\n\n-   It is easy to keep until the first order continuity when chaining\n    curves. Moreover, every B\u00e9zier curve can be cut at any point into\n    two new B\u00e9zier curves. In fact, the industry uses series of B\u00e9zier\n    curves with only 4 control points (a bicubic version of the\n    equations) to draw complex shapes.\n\n-   The curves never do fancy stuff and always remain within the convex\n    hull of the control points.\n\n-   For one and two points the definition is still valid and the result\n    became a point and a segment of line, respectively.\n\n-   But it is impossible to draw circles or arcs of circle.\n\n-   It is also impossible to draw two parallel curves (except in trivial\n    cases: straight line B\u00e9ziers and coincident B\u00e9ziers curves)\n\n-   If the first and the last point are the same, the curve is closed.\n    And if $\\boldsymbol{P}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}_{n-1}$ are aligned\n    with $\\boldsymbol{P}_0$ then the curve is closed with a first order\n    continuity.\n\nCurve Cut\n=========\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{B}_p(t)$ be a Bezier curve, defined by its control\npoints $\\boldsymbol{P}_0$ to $\\boldsymbol{P}_{n}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet $a, b$ be such as $[a,b] \\subset [0,1]$ Let\n$u = {{t - a} \\over {b - a}}$ be such as\n$\\forall u \\in [0,1], t \\in [a,b]$\n\n$\\boldsymbol{B}_q(u)$ is a part of the initial bezier curve with new\ncontrol points $\\boldsymbol{Q}_{0}$ to $\\boldsymbol{Q}_{n}$ whose will\nbe determined.\n\nFor $n$ control points $\\boldsymbol{B}(t)$ is a $n-1$-order polynom.\n\n$\\boldsymbol{B}_p(a) = \\boldsymbol{B}_q(0)$\n\n$\\boldsymbol{B}_p(b) = \\boldsymbol{B}_q(1)$\n\nLet take $n-2$ more points, evenly spaced in \\[a,b\\]\n$u_i = k / {n-1} \\forall k \\in [1 .. n-1]$\n\n$\\boldsymbol{B}_p(u (b - a) + a) = \\boldsymbol{B}_q(u_i)$ for each $u_i$\n\nFor a 4 control points bezier curve If we take $u$ in\n$(0, {1 \\over 3}, {2 \\over 3}, 1)$, hence $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$\nrespectively equal to $a$, $\\frac{b - 2 a}{3}$, $\\frac{2b - a}{3}$, $b$\n\n$ \\boldsymbol{Q}_0 = \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_0) $\n\n$ \\boldsymbol{Q}_1 = {-15 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_0) + 54 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_1) -27 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_2) + 6 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_3)} / 18 $\n\n$ \\boldsymbol{Q}_2 = {6 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_0) -27 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_1) + 54 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_2) -15 \\boldsymbol{B}_p(t_3)} / 18 $\n\n$ \\boldsymbol{Q}_3 = \\boldsymbol{B}_p(b) $",
