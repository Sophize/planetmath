  "definition": "The [*angle between two lines*]{} in a plane is defined to be\n\n-   0, if the lines are parallel;\n\n-   the smaller angle having as sides the half-lines starting from the\n    intersection point of the lines and lying on those two lines, if the\n    lines are not parallel.\n\nIf $\\theta$ denotes the angle between two lines, it always satisfies the\ninequalities $$\\begin{aligned}\n      0 \\leqq \\theta \\leqq \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\\end{aligned}$$ If the slopes\nof the two lines are $m_1$ and $m_2$, the angle $\\theta$ is obtained\nfrom $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\tan\\theta \\;=\\; \\left|\\frac{m_1\\!-\\!m_2}{1\\!+\\!m_1m_2}\\right|.\\end{aligned}$$\nThis equation clicks in the case that $m_1m_2 = -1$, when the lines are\nperpendicular and $\\theta$ equals to $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Also,\nif one of the lines is parallel to $y$-axis, it has no slope; then the\nangle $\\theta$ must be deduced using the slope of the other line.\n\nIf one of the slopes is $0$, the angle between the two lines is just the\nangle between one of the lines and the $x$-axis. Assume the other line\nhas slope $m$, then formula (2) above becomes $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\tan\\theta \\;=\\; \\left|m\\right|.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIf, on the other hand, one of the slopes is infinite, meaning that the\nline is parallel to the $y$-axis, then the angle between two lines is\nthe same as the angle between one line (with slope $m$) and the\n$y$-axis, which is $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\tan\\theta \\;=\\; \\left|\\frac{1}{m}\\right|.\\end{aligned}$$ The\nabove formula is consistent with formula (2) in the sense that if we let\none of $m_1$ or $m_2$ approach $\\infty$, we get formula (4).\\\n**Remark**. If both slopes are positive, then formula (2) above is\nreally just a disguised form of the subtraction formula for tangent.\n\n(-5,-1)(7,4) (-1,0)(-3,-1)(6,4) (-2,-1)(5,3) (1,-1)(4,4)\n(-0.2,0)[0.7]{}[0]{}[30]{} (1.2,0)[0.9]{}[0]{}[35]{}\n(2.565,1.609)[1]{}[30]{}[58]{} (0.8,0.2)[$\\alpha$]{}\n(2.35,0.2)[$\\beta$]{} (5.75,-0.2)[$x$]{} (-0.8,3.8)[$y$]{}\n(4.1,3.2)[$\\beta-\\alpha$]{} (3.6,3.8)[$\\l_2$]{} (5.2,2.8)[$\\l_1$]{}\n(-3,0)[.]{} (-1,-1)[.]{}\n\nIn the diagram above, we see that the angle between the two lines is the\nalgebraic difference of the two angles made between each of the lines\nand the $x$-axis.\\\nIn the Euclidean space, the angle $\\theta$ between two lines is most\ncomfortably defined by using the direction vectors $\\vec{u}$ and\n$\\vec{v}$ of the lines:\n$$\\cos\\theta \\;=\\; \\left|\\frac{\\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{u}||\\vec{v}|}\\right|$$\nAlso this angle satisfies (1).
