  "definition": "An *isosceles triangle* is a triangle with two congruent sides. The\nangles opposite these two sides are the [*base angles*]{} and the angle\nbetween those sides is the [*vertex angle*]{} of the triangle.\n\nThis definition implies that any equilateral triangle is isosceles too,\nbut there are isosceles triangles that are not equilateral.\n\nIn any isosceles triangle, the angles opposite to the congruent sides\nare also congruent. In fact, this condition could be used to give an\nalternate definition of isosceles, since a triangle is isosceles if and\nonly if it has two congruent angles.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the , the median and the bisector to the\nthird side are the same line.\n\n![image](trianglebyside)",
