  "definition": "The $x$- and $y$-axes the $xy$-plane in four right-angle domains which\nare called the [*quadrants*]{} of the plane. They are numbered going\nround the origin in anticlockwise direction so that\n$$\\{(x,\\,y) \\mid \\;  x > 0,\\; y > 0\\}$$ is the [*first quadrant*]{},\n$$\\{(x,\\,y) \\mid \\;  x < 0,\\; y > 0\\}$$ the [*second quadrant*]{}, and\nso on.\n\nNaturally, one can speak of the quadrants of the complex plane, too.\\\nThe lines $y = \\pm x$ have as their slope angles $\\pm 45^\\circ$, thus\nhalving the quadrant angles; they are called the [*quadrant\nbisectors*]{}. Cf. angle bisector as locus.",
