  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n----------\n\nLet $V$ be a vector space over a division ring $D$. An *affine\ncombination* of a finite set of vectors $v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\in V$ is a\nlinear combination of the vectors $$k_1v_1+\\cdots+k_nv_n$$ such that\n$k_i\\in D$ subject to the condition $k_1+\\cdots+k_n=1$. In effect, an\naffine combination is a weighted average of the vectors in question.\n\nFor example, $v=\\frac{1}{2}v_1+\\frac{1}{2}v_2$ is an affine combination\nof $v_1$ and $v_2$ provided that the characteristic of $D$ is not $2$.\n$v$ is known as the midpoint of $v_1$ and $v_2$. More generally, if\n$\\operatorname{char}(D)$ does not divide $m$, then\n$$v=\\frac{1}{m}(v_1+\\cdots+v_m)$$ is an affine combination of the\n$v_i$\u2019s. $v$ is the barycenter of $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$.\n\nRelations with Affine Subspaces {#relations-with-affine-subspaces .unnumbered}\n-------------------------------\n\nAssume now $\\operatorname{char}(D)=0$. Given $v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\in V$, we\ncan form the set $A$ of all affine combinations of the $v_i$\u2019s. We have\nthe following\n\n> $A$ is a finite dimensional affine subspace. Conversely, a finite\n> dimensional affine subspace $A$ is the set of all affine combinations\n> of a finite set of vectors in $A$.\n\nSuppose $A$ is the set of affine combinations of $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$. If\n$n=1$, then $A$ is a singleton $\\lbrace v\\rbrace$, so $A=0+v$, where 0\nis the null subspace of $V$. If $n>1$, we may pick a non-zero vector\n$v\\in A$. Define $S=\\lbrace a-v\\mid a\\in A\\rbrace$. Then for any\n$s\\in S$ and $d\\in D$, $ds=d(a-v)=da+(1-d)v-v$. Since $da+(1-d)v\\in A$,\n$ds\\in S$. If $s_1,s_2\\in S$, then\n$\\frac{1}{2}(s_1+s_2)=\\frac{1}{2}((a_1-v)+(a_2-v))=\\frac{1}{2} (a_1+a_2)-v\\in S$,\nsince $\\frac{1}{2}(a_1+a_2)\\in A$. So $\\frac{1}{2}(s_1+s_2)\\in S$.\nTherefore, $s_1+s_2= 2(\\frac{1}{2}(s_1+s_2))\\in S$. This shows that $S$\nis a vector subspace of $V$ and that $A=S+v$ is an affine subspace.\n\nConversely, let $A$ be a finite dimensional affine subspace. Write\n$A=S+v$, where $S$ is a subspace of $V$. Since\n$\\operatorname{dim}(S)= \\operatorname{dim}(A)=n$, $S$ has a basis\n$\\lbrace s_1,\\ldots,s_n\\rbrace$. For each $i=1,\\ldots, n$, define\n$v_i=ns_i+v$. Given $a\\in A$, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\na &=& s+v=k_1s_1+\\cdots+k_ns_n+v \\\\ \n&=& \\frac{k_1}{n}(v_1-v)+\\cdots+\\frac{k_n}{n}(v_n-v)+v \\\\ \n&=& \\frac{k_1}{n}v_1+\\cdots+\\frac{k_n}{n}v_n+(1-\\frac{k_1}{n}-\\cdots- \\frac{k_n}{n})v.\\end{aligned}$$\nFrom this calculation, it is evident that $a$ is an affine combination\nof $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$, and $v$.\n\nWhen $A$ is the set of affine combinations of two distinct vectors\n$v,w$, we see that $A$ is a line, in the sense that $A=S+v$, a translate\nof a one-dimensional subspace $S$ (a line through 0). Every element in\n$A$ has the form $dv+(1-d)w$, $d\\in D$. Inspecting the first part of the\nproof in the previous proposition, we see that the argument involves no\nmore than two vectors at a time, so the following useful corollary is\napparant:\n\n> $A$ is an affine subspace iff for every pair of vectors in $A$, the\n> line formed by the pair is also in $A$.\n\nNote, however, that the $A$ in the above corollary is not assumed to be\nfinite dimensional.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   If one of $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ is the zero vector, then $A$ coincides\n    with $S$. In other words, an affine subspace is a vector subspace if\n    it contains the zero vector.\n\n-   Given\n    $A=\\lbrace k_1v_1+\\cdots +k_nv_n \\mid v_i\\in V, k_i\\in D, \\sum k_i=1 \\rbrace$,\n    the subset $$\\lbrace k_1v_1+\\cdots+ k_nv_n\\in A\\mid k_i=0\\rbrace$$\n    is also an affine subspace.\n\nAffine Independence {#affine-independence .unnumbered}\n-------------------\n\nSince every element in a finite dimensional affine subspace $A$ is an\naffine combination of a finite set of vectors in $A$, we have the\nsimilar concept of a spanning set of an affine subspace. A minimal\nspanning set $M$ of an affine subspace is said to be *affinely\nindependent*. We have the following three equivalent characterization of\nan affinely independent subset $M$ of a finite dimensional affine\nsubspace:\n\n1.  $M=\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ is affinely independent.\n\n2.  every element in $A$ can be written as an affine combination of\n    elements in $M$ in a *unique* fashion.\n\n3.  for every $v\\in M$, $N=\\lbrace v_i-v\\mid v\\neq v_i\\rbrace$ is\n    linearly independent.\n\nWe will proceed as follows: (1) implies (2) implies (3) implies (1).\n\n\\(1) implies (2). If $a\\in A$ has two distinct representations\n$k_1v_1+\\cdots+k_nv_n=a= r_1v_1+\\cdots+r_nv_n$, we may assume, say\n$k_1\\neq r_1$. So $k_1-r_1$ is invertible with inverse $t\\in D$. Then\n$$v_1=t(r_2-k_2)v_2+\\cdots+t(r_n-k_n)v_n.$$ Furthermore,\n$$\\sum_{i=2}^n t(r_i-k_i)=t(\\sum_{i=2}^n r_i-\\sum_{i=2}^n k_i)=t(1-r_1-1+k_1)=1.$$\nSo for any $b\\in A$, we have\n$$b=s_1v_1+\\cdots+s_nv_n=s_1(t(r_2-k_2)v_2+\\cdots+t(r_n-k_n)v_n)+\\cdots+s_nv_n.$$\nThe sum of the coefficients is easily seen to be 1, which implies that\n$\\lbrace v_2,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ is a spanning set of $A$ that is smaller\nthan $M$, a contradiction.\n\n\\(2) implies (3). Pick $v=v_1$. Suppose\n$0=s_2(v_2-v_1)+\\cdots+s_n(v_n-v_1)$. Expand and we have\n$0=(-s_2-\\cdots-s_n)v_1+s_2v_2+\\cdots+s_nv_n$. So\n$(1-s_2-\\cdots-s_n)v_1+s_2v_2+\\cdots+s_nv_n=v_1\\in A$. By assumption,\nthere is exactly one way to express $v_1$, so we conclude that\n$s_2=\\cdots=s_n=0$.\n\n\\(3) implies (1). If $M$ were not minimal, then some $v\\in M$ could be\nexpressed as an affine combination of the remaining vectors in $M$. So\nsuppose $v_1=k_2v_2+\\cdots+k_nv_n$. Since $\\sum k_i=1$, we can rewrite\nthis as $0=k_2(v_2-v_1)+\\cdots+k_n(v_n-v_1)$. Since not all $k_i=0$,\n$N=\\lbrace v_2-v_1,\\ldots, v_n-v_1\\rbrace$ is not linearly independent.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   If $\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ is affinely independent set\n    spanning $A$, then $\\operatorname{dim}(A)=n-1$.\n\n-   More generally, a set $M$ (not necessarily finite) of vectors is\n    said to be affinely independent if there is a vector $v\\in M$, such\n    that $N=\\lbrace w-v\\mid v\\neq w\\in M\\rbrace$ is linearly independent\n    (every finite subset of $N$ is linearly independent). The above\n    three characterizations are still valid in this general setting.\n    However, one must be careful that an affine combination is a\n    finitary operation so that when we take the sum of an infinite\n    number of vectors, we have to realize that only a finite number of\n    them are non-zero.\n\n-   Given any set $S$ of vectors, the *affine hull* of $S$ is the\n    smallest affine subspace $A$ that contains every vector of $S$,\n    denoted by $\\operatorname{Aff}(S)$. Every vector in\n    $\\operatorname{Aff}(S)$ can be written as an affine combination of\n    vectors in $S$.",
