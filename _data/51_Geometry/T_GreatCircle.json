  "definition": "The intersection of a sphere with a plane that passes through the center\nof the sphere is called a *great circle*. Note that it is equivalent to\nsay that a great circle of a sphere is any circle that lies on the\nsurface of the sphere and has maximum circumference. Geographically\nspeaking, longitudes are examples of great circles; however, with the\nexception of the equator, *no* latitude is a great circle.\n\nInfinitely many great circles pass through two antipodal points of a\nsphere. Otherwise, two distinct points on a sphere determine a unique\ngreat circle.\n\nAn arc of a great circle is called a *great arc*.\n\nNote that great circles and great arcs are geodesics of the surface of\nthe sphere on which they lie. Thus, in spherical geometry, if a sphere\nis serving as the model, then are defined to be great circles of the\nsphere, and are defined to be great arcs of the sphere.",
