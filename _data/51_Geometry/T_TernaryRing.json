  "definition": "Let $R$ be a set containing at least two distinct elements $0$ and $1$,\nand $*$ a ternary operation on $R$. Write $a*b*c$ the image of $(a,b,c)$\nunder $*$. We call $(R,*,0,1)$, or simply just $R$, a *ternary ring* if\n\n1.  $a*0*b=0*a*b=b$ for any $a,b\\in R$,\n\n2.  $1*a*0=a*1*0=a$ for any $a\\in R$,\n\n3.  given $a,b,c,d\\in R$ with $a\\ne c$, the equation $x*a*b=x*c*d$ has a\n    unique solution for $x$,\n\n4.  given $a,b,c\\in R$, the equation $a*b*x=c$ has a unique solution for\n    $x$,\n\n5.  given $a,b,c,d\\in R$, with $a\\ne c$, the system of equations\n    $$\\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    a * x * y = b \\\\\n    c * x * y = d\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ has a unique solution for $(x,y)$.\n\nGiven a ternary ring $R$, we may form two binary operations on $R$, one\ncalled the *addition* $+$, and the other the *multiplication* $\\cdot$ on\n$R$: $$\\begin{aligned}\na+b &:=& a*1*b, \\\\\na\\cdot b &:=& a*b*0.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$(R,+,0)$ and $(R-\\lbrace 0\\rbrace,\\cdot,1)$ are loops, and $0$ is the\nzero element in $R$ under the multiplication $\\cdot$.\n\nWe first show that $(R,+,0)$ is a loop. Given $a,b\\in R$, there is a\nunique $c\\in R$ such that $a*1*c = b$, but this is exactly $a+c=b$. In\naddition, there is a unique $d\\in R$ such that $d*1*a = b = d*0*b$. But\n$d*1*a=b$ means $d+a=b$. This shows that $(R,+)$ is a quasigroup. Now,\n$a+0=a*1*0=a$ and $0+a=0*1*a=a$, so $0$ is the identity with respect to\n$+$. Therefore, $(R,+,0)$ is a loop.\n\nNext we show that $(S,\\cdot,1)$ is a loop, where $S=R-\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$.\nGiven $a,b\\in S$, there is a unique $c\\in R$ such that\n$c*a*0=b=c*0*b=b$, since $a\\ne 0$. From $c*a*0=b$, we get $c\\cdot a=b$.\nFurthermore, $c\\ne 0$, for otherwise $b=c*a*0=0*a*0=0$, contradicting\nthe fact that $b\\in S$. In addition, there is a unique $d\\in R$ such\nthat we have a system of equations $a*d*0=b$ and $0*d*0=0$. From\n$a*d*0=b$ we get $a\\cdot d=b$. Furthermore $d\\ne 0$, for otherwise\n$b=a*d*0=a*0*0=0$, contradicting the fact that $b\\in S$. Thus,\n$(S,\\cdot,1)$ is a quasigroup. Now, $a\\cdot 1 = a*1*0=a$ and\n$1\\cdot a=1*a*0=a$, showing that $(S,\\cdot,1)$ is a loop.\n\nFinally, for any $a\\in R$, $a\\cdot 0 = a*0*0=0$ and $0\\cdot a= 0*a*0=0$.\n\nAnother property of a ternary ring is that, if the ternary ring is\nfinite, then conditions 4 and 5 are equivalent in the presence of the\nfirst three.\n\nLet $R$ be a ternary ring, and $a,b,c$ are arbitrary elements of $R$.\n$R$ is said to be *linear* if $a*b*c = a\\cdot b+c$ for all $a,b,c\\in R$,\n*left distributive* if $a\\cdot (b+c)=a\\cdot b+a\\cdot c$, *right\ndistributive* if $(a+b)\\cdot c = a\\cdot c +b\\cdot c$, and *distributive*\nif it is both left and right distributive.\n\nFor example, any division ring $D$, associative or not, is a linear\nternary ring if we define the ternary operation $*$ on $D$ by\n$a*b*c:=a\\cdot b+c$. Any associative division ring $D$ is a distributive\nternary ring. This easy verification is left to the reader. Semifields,\nnear fields are also examples of ternary rings.\n\n**Remark**. Ternary rings were invented by Marshall Hall in his studies\nof axiomatic projective and affine planes. Therefore, a ternary ring is\nalso called a *Hall ternary ring*, or a *planar ternary ring*. It can be\nshown that in every affine plane, one can set up a coordinate system,\nand from this coordinate system, one can construct a ternary ring.\nConversely, given any ternary ring, one can define an affine plane so\nthat its coordinate system corresponds to this ternary ring.\n\n[7]{} R.
