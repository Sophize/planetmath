  "definition": "A *spheroid* or *ellipsoid of revolution* is an ellipsoid such that two\nof the axes are equal in length. The name ellipsoid of revolution refers\nto the fact that such a shape is rotationally symmetric about the third\naxis. By way of contrast, the term *triaxial ellipsoid* is used to\nspecify that the three axes are of different lengths. Also, the term\n*oblate* is used to describe spheriods in which the two axes of equal\nlength are longer than the third (think of a doorknob) whilst the term\n*prolate* is used to describe spheriods for which the two equally long\naxes are shorter than the third axis (think of a cigar).",
