  "definition": "A *polygon* is a , closed path that lies on a plane and is composed\nentirely of line segments. In other words, if someone were to walk on a\npolygon, then the person would end up back where he started; moreover,\nif a person walks on a polygon so that he travels exactly once around\nthe polygon, then the never crosses itself, and the person is either\nwalking along a line or turning.\n\nBelow are some examples of polygons:\n\n(0,0)(11,5) (0,0)(3,0)(2,5) (4,0)(7,0)(6,2)(7,3)(5,5)\n(8,0)(8.4,5)(9.5,4)(11,2)(10,1)\n\nA *side* of a polygon is a line segment on the polygon that is of\nmaximal length. In other words, any line segment that contains a side of\na polygon and has a greater length than that side is not entirely on\nthat polygon. A *vertex* of a polygon is an endpoint of a side of the\npolygon. Note that each vertex of a polygon is simultaneously the\nendpoint of exactly two adjacent sides of the polygon.\n\nA polygon with $n$ sides is called an *$n$-gon*. For small $n$, there\nare more traditional names:\n\n   number of sides   name of polygon\n  ----------------- -----------------\n          3             triangle\n          4           quadrilateral\n          5             pentagon\n          6              hexagon\n          7             heptagon\n          8              octagon\n         10              decagon\n\nIn spherical geometry, polygons with only two sides exist. They are\ncalled biangles.\n\nThe *perimeter* of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\n\nAn *interior angle* of a polygon is the measure of an angle formed by\ntwo adjacent sides such that the angle is measured with respect to the\ninterior of the polygon. For each polygon in the picture below, the\ninterior angles are marked in blue:\n\n(0,0)(10,5) (0,0)(4.5,0)(1.8,4) (0,0)[0.5]{}[0]{}[65.77]{}\n(4.5,0)[0.5]{}[124.02]{}[180]{} (1.8,4)[0.5]{}[245.77]{}[304.02]{}\n(5,5)(7.5,0)(10,5)(7.5,3) (5,5)[0.5]{}[296.565]{}[321.34]{}\n(7.5,0)[0.5]{}[63.435]{}[116.565]{} (10,5)[0.5]{}[218.66]{}[243.435]{}\n(7.5,3)[0.5]{}[141.34]{}[398.66]{}\n\nNote that the of any interior angle of a polygon is strictly between\n$0^{\\circ}$ and $360^{\\circ}$ and is not equal to $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe have the following criterion for a polygon to be convex:\n\nA polygon is convex if and only if each of its interior angles has a\nmeasure that is strictly less than $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe *angle sum* of a polygon is the sum of the measures of its interior\nangles. In Euclidean geometry, the angle sum of an $n$-gon is exactly\n$180(n-2)^{\\circ}$.\n\nAn *exterior angle* of a polygon is any angle that forms a linear pair\nwith an interior angle of a polygon. In the picture below, all exterior\nangles of the triangle are marked in blue:\n\n(0,0)(5,6) (0,1)(5,1) (0,0)(3,6) (0,6)(5,0)\n(0.5,1)[0.3]{}[63.435]{}[180]{} (0.5,1)[0.3]{}[243.435]{}[360]{}\n(4.167,1)[0.3]{}[0]{}[129.81]{} (4.167,1)[0.3]{}[180]{}[309.81]{}\n(1.875,3.75)[0.3]{}[129.81]{}[243.435]{}\n(1.875,3.75)[0.3]{}[309.81]{}[423.435]{}\n\nFor a more rigorous treatment of polygons, see .",
