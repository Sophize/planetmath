  "statement": "Consider a circle with center $O$ and two distinct points on the circle\n$A$ and $B$. If $C$ is a third point on the circle not equal to either\n$A$ or $B$, then the *circumferential angle* at $C$ subtending the arc\n$AB$ is the angle $ACB$. Here, by arc $AB$, we mean the arc of the\ncircle that does not contain the points $C$.\n\nSimilarly, the *central angle* subtending arc $AB$ is the angle $AOB$.\nThe central angle corresponds to the arc $AB$ measured on the same side\nof the circle as the angle itself. Note that if $AB$ is a diameter of\nthe circle, then the central angle is $180^{\\circ}$.\n\n*\\[Euclid, Book III, Prop. 20\\]* In any circle, a circumferential angle\nis half the size of the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nThere are actually several distinct cases. Consider $\\angle BAC$ in a\ncircle with center $O$, and draw $AO, BO, CO$ as well as the chord\ncontaining both $A$ and $O$:\n\n(-1.0000,-2.0000)(5.0000,3.2000) (-1.1,-2)[.]{} (5,4)[.]{}\n(0.0000,0.0000)(4.2000,0.0000)(1.5750,2.5720) (2.1000,0.4822)[2.1547]{}\n(0.0000,0.0000) \\[-180.0000\\](0.0000,0.0000)[$A$]{} (4.2000,0.0000)\n\\[0.0000\\](4.2000,0.0000)[$B$]{} (1.5750,2.5720)\n\\[90.0000\\](1.5750,2.5720)[$C$]{} (2.1000,0.4822)\n\\[140.0000\\](2.1000,0.4822)[$O$]{} (0.0000,0.0000)(4.2000,0.9645)\n(4.2000,0.9645) \\[0.0000\\](4.2000,0.9645)[$F$]{}\n(2.1000,0.4822)(4.2000,0.0000) (2.1000,0.4822)(1.5750,2.5720)\n(1.0836,0.0949)(1.0164,0.3873) (3.1836,0.3873)(3.1164,0.0949)\n(1.6920,1.4906)(1.9830,1.5637)\n\nIn this case, the center of the circle lies between the arms of the\ncircumferential angle. Now, since $AO=OB$, $\\triangle AOB$ is isosceles,\nand $\\angle FOB$ is an exterior angle. Thus\n$$\\angle FOB=\\angle OAB + \\angle OBA = 2\\angle OAB$$ Similarly,\n$\\triangle AOC$ is isosceles, and\n$$\\angle FOC=\\angle OAC + \\angle OCA = 2\\angle OAC$$ and it follows that\n$$\\angle BOC=\\angle FOB + \\angle FOC = 2\\angle OAB + 2\\angle OAC = 2\\angle BAC$$\nproving the result.\n\nA second case is the case in which both arms of the angle lie to one\nside of the circle\u2019s center:\n\n(-1.0000,-3.0000)(5.0000,2.0000) (-1.1,-3)[.]{} (5,2.1)[.]{}\n(0.0000,0.0000)(4.2000,0.0000)(2.4881,1.4365) (2.1000,-0.7643)[2.2348]{}\n(0.0000,0.0000) \\[-180.0000\\](0.0000,0.0000)[$A$]{} (4.2000,0.0000)\n\\[0.0000\\](4.2000,0.0000)[$B$]{} (2.4881,1.4365)\n\\[90.0000\\](2.4881,1.4365)[$C$]{} (2.1000,-0.7643)\n\\[-45.0000\\](2.1000,-0.7643)[$O$]{} (0.0000,0.0000)(4.2000,-1.5287)\n(4.2000,-1.5287) \\[0.0000\\](4.2000,-1.5287)[$F$]{}\n(2.1000,-0.7643)(4.2000,0.0000) (2.1000,-0.7643)(2.4881,1.4365)\n(0.9987,-0.5231)(1.1013,-0.2412) (3.0987,-0.2412)(3.2013,-0.5231)\n(2.1463,0.3621)(2.4418,0.3100)\n\nThe proof is similar to the previous case, except that the angle in\nquestion is the difference rather than the sum of two known angles. Here\nwe see that both $\\triangle AOB$ and $\\triangle AOC$ are isosceles, so\nthat again $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle COF &= 2\\angle OAC \\\\\n\\angle BOF &= 2\\angle OAB\\end{aligned}$$ Subtracting, we get\n$$\\angle COB = \\angle COF - \\angle BOF = 2\\angle OAC -2\\angle OAB = 2\\angle BAC$$\nas desired.\n\nThe final case is the case in which one arm of the angle goes through\nthe center of the circle. This is a degenerate form of the first case,\nand the same proof follows through except that one of the angles is\nzero.",
