  "definition": "Two $$\\begin{aligned}\nU \\;=\\; 0 \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad V \\;=\\; 0\\end{aligned}$$ can intersect\nin four points, some of which may coincide or be \u201cimaginary\u201d.\n\nThe equation $$\\begin{aligned}\npU+qV \\;=\\; 0,\\end{aligned}$$ where $p$ and $q$ are freely chooseable\nparametres, not both 0, represents the *pencil* of all the conics which\npass through the four intersection points of the conics (1); see\nquadratic curves.\n\nThe same pencil is gotten by replacing one of the conics (1) by two\nlines $L_1 = 0$ and $L_2 = 0$, such that the first line passes through\ntwo of the intersection points and the second line through the other two\nof those points; then the equation of the pencil reads $$\\begin{aligned}\npL_1L_2+qV \\;=\\; 0.\\end{aligned}$$ One can also replace similarly the\nother ($V$) of the conics (1) by two lines $L_3 = 0$ and $L_4 = 0$; then\nthe pencil of conics is $$\\begin{aligned}\npL_1L_2+qL_3L_4 \\;=\\; 0.\\end{aligned}$$ For any pair $(p,\\,q)$ of\nvalues, one conic section (4) passes through the four points determined\nby the equation pairs\n$$L_1 = 0\\;\\land\\;L_3 = 0, \\quad L_1 = 0\\;\\land\\;L_4 = 0, \\quad L_2 = 0\\;\\land\\;L_3 = 0,\\quad L_2 = 0\\;\\land\\,L_4 = 0.$$\\\nThe pencils given by the equations (2), (3) and (4) can be obtained also\nby fixing either of the parametres $p$ and $q$ for example to $-1$, when\ne.g. the pencil (4) may be expressed by $$\\begin{aligned}\npL_1L_2 \\;=\\; L_3L_4.\\end{aligned}$$ **Application.** Using (5), we can\neasily find the equation of a conics which passes through five given\npoints; we may first form the equations of the sides $L_1 = 0$,\n$L_2 = 0$, $L_3 = 0$ and $L_4 = 0$ of the quadrilateral determined by\nfour of the given points. The equation of the searched conic is then\n(5), where the value of $p$ is gotten by substituting the coordinates of\nthe fifth point to (5) and by solving $p$.\n\n**Example.** Find the equation of the conic section passing through the\npoints\n$$(-1,\\,0), \\quad (1,\\,0), \\quad (0,\\,1), \\quad (0,\\,2), \\quad (2,\\,2).$$\nWe can take the lines\n$$2x+y-2 = 0, \\quad x-y+1 = 0, \\quad 2x-y+2 = 0, \\quad x+y-1 = 0$$\npassing through pairs of the four first points. The equation of the\npencil of the conics passing through these points is thus of the form\n$$\\begin{aligned}\np(2x+y-2)(x-y+1) \\;=\\; (2x-y+2)(x+y-1).\\end{aligned}$$ The conics passes\nthrough $(2,\\,2)$, if we substitute $x := 2$, $y := 2$; it follows that\n$p = 3$. Using this value in (6) results the equation of the searched\nconics: $$\\begin{aligned}\n2x^2-y^2-2xy+3y-2 \\;=\\; 0\\end{aligned}$$ The coefficients $2$, $-1$,\n$-2$ of the second degree terms let infer, that this curve is a\nhyperbola with axes not parallel to the coordinate axes (see ).",
