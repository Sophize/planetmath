  "statement": "Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a triangle and $AX, BY, CZ$ three concurrent\nlines at $P$. If $AX',BY', CZ'$ are the respective isogonal conjugate\nlines for $AX,BY,CZ$, then $AX', BY',CZ'$ are also concurrent at some\npoint $P'$.\n\nAn applications of this theorem proves the existence of Lemoine point\n(for it is the intersection point of the symmedians):\n\n![image](lemoinep)\n\nThis theorem is a direct consequence of Ceva\u2019s theorem (trigonometric\nversion).",
