  "definition": "A *Buekenhout-Tits geoemtry*, or simply *geometry*, is a quadruple\n$(\\Gamma,\\#,T,\\tau)$, where\n\n1.  $\\Gamma$ is a set whose elements are called objects or varieties\n\n2.  $T$ is a set whose elements are called types\n\n3.  $\\tau$ is a function from $\\Gamma$ onto $T$, and we say that two\n    objects $a,b\\in \\Gamma$ are of the same type if $\\tau(a)=\\tau(b)$\n\n4.  $\\#$ is a reflexive symmetric relation on $\\Gamma$ (called the\n    incidence relation) such that if objects $a,b$ are of the same type\n    and $a \\# b$, then $a=b$.\n\nWe usually write $\\Gamma$ for the geometry. The cardinality of $T$ is\ncalled the *rank* of $\\Gamma$. $T$ is usually assumed to be finite.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of a Buekenhout-Tits geometry. Let $T$ be the\nset consisting of four types: vertex, edge, face, and cube. Let\n$X=\\lbrace A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H\\rbrace$, and $\\Gamma$ be the set of subsets\nof $X$ consisting of the following:\n\n-   all of the singletons\n\n-   the following doubletons:\n    $AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, FG, GH, HE, AE, BF, CG$, and $DH$, where a\n    two-letter string represents the set containing the letters\n\n-   the following 4-sets: $ABCD, EFGH, BCFG, AEDH, ABFE$, and $CDHG$,\n    where the four-letter string represents the set containing the\n    letters, and\n\n-   $X$ itself\n\nThe map $\\tau$ is defined as follows: all the singletons are mapped to\nvertex, all the doubletons to edge, the 4-sets to face, and $X$ to cube.\nThe following diagram is useful as a visual reference.\n\n(-14,-3)(2,4) (-4,-0.5)(-2,-0.5)(-2,1.5)(-4,1.5)\n(-5,1)(-4,1.5)(-4,-0.5)(-5,-1) (-5,1)(-4,1.5)(-2,1.5)(-3,1)\n(-2,-0.5)(-2,1.5)(-3,1)(-3,-1) (-5,-1)(-3,-1)(-3,1)(-5,1) (-5,1)[B]{}\n(-3,-1)[D]{} (-3,1)[C]{} (-5,-1)[A]{} (-4,-0.5)[E]{} (-2,-0.5)[H]{}\n(-2,1.5)[G]{} (-4,1.5)[F]{}\n\nFinally, $\\#$ is defined as the inclusion relation: $P\\# Q$ iff\n$P\\subseteq Q$ or $Q\\subseteq P$. Then $(\\Gamma,\\#,T,\\tau)$ is a\nBuekenhout-Tits geometry.\n\nBuekenhout-Tits geometries are generalizations of and affine geometries,\nand indeed incidence geometries in general. They also include examples\nwhere geometric meanings may not be apparent at first sight. Below are\ntwo such examples:\n\n-   A bipartite graph can be thought of as a Buekenhout-Tits geometry:\n    we can take $\\Gamma$ as the set of vertices, and two vertices are of\n    the same type if they have the same chromatic number, and are\n    incident if they are either the same, or there is an edge connecting\n    them.\n\n-   Let $G$ be a group and $\\lbrace G_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a set of\n    subgroups of $G$, indexed by some set $I$. Let $\\Gamma$ be the set\n    of all (left) cosets of $G_i$, for all $i\\in I$. Note that\n    $xG_i=yG_j$ iff $i=j$ and $y^{-1}x\\in G_i$. Call $xG_i$ and $yG_j$\n    to be of the same type if $i=j$, and $xG_i \\# yG_j$ if\n    $xG_i\\cap yG_j\\ne \\varnothing$. Then the geometry defined is a\n    Buekenhout-Tits geometry.\n\nAn incidence structure can be thought of as a Buekenhout-Tits geometry\nof rank 2.\n\n**Remark**. The *graph* of a geometry $(\\Gamma,\\#,T,\\tau)$ is the pair\n$(\\Gamma,\\#)$, where objects are vertices of the graph, and $(a,b)$ is\nan edge of the graph iff $a\\#b$. Properly speaking, the associated graph\nis a pseudograph since $\\#$ is reflexive, so that there is a loop for\neach vertex.\n\n[6]{} , edited by Francis Buekenhout, Elsevier Science Publishing Co.\n(1995) M.
