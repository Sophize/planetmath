  "definition": "A *rhombus* (plural *rhombi*, or *rhombuses*) is a quadrilateral with\nits four sides equal. A square is a rhombus, but a rhombus need not be a\nsquare, since the angles need not all be equal. Every rhombus is,\nhowever, a parallelogram.\n\n![image](rhombus)\n\nIn any rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. A nice result\nfollowing from this, is that joining the midpoints of the sides, always\ngives a rectangle.\n\nIf $D$ and $d$ are the lengths of the diagonals, then the area of the\nrhombus is $$\\frac{Dd}{2}.$$",
