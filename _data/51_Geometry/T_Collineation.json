  "definition": "In Euclidean geometry, translations and dilations are both examples of\none-to-one onto functions that map straight lines to straight lines.\nCollineation is a generalization of this notion to more abstract\ngeometric structures.\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$ be a\nnear-linear space. A *collineation* on $\\mathscr{S}$ is an one-to-one\nonto linear function on $\\mathscr{S}$ such that its inverse is also\nlinear. A collineation on $\\mathscr{S}$ is also called an automorphism\non $\\mathscr{S}$.\n\nIt is easy to see that a collineation preserves collinearity: if three\npoints are collinear, so are their images under a collineation.\n\n**Example 1**. let $\\mathscr{S}$ be the near-linear space consisting of\nfour points $P,Q,R,S$, and four lines $PQ,QR,RS$, and $SP$.\n\n(0,0)(2,2) (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0)(0,1)(1,1)(1,0)\n(-0.125,0)[$S$]{} (-0.125,1)[$P$]{} (1.125,1)[$Q$]{} (1.125,0)[$R$]{}\n\nThere are six collineations of $\\mathscr{S}$:\n\n-   $\\sigma_1$ is the identity function,\n\n-   $\\sigma_2=(PQRS)$,\n\n-   $\\sigma_3=\\sigma_2^2=(PR)(QS)$,\n\n-   $\\sigma_4=(PSRQ)=\\sigma_2^{-1}$,\n\n-   $\\sigma_5=(PR)$,\n\n-   $\\sigma_6=(QS)$.\n\nIt is easy to see that this is the alternating group on four letters\n$A_4$.\n\nIf $PR$ is added as another line of $\\mathscr{S}$,\n\n(0,0)(2,2) (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0)(0,1)(1,1)(1,0) (0,1)(1,0)\n(-0.125,0)[$S$]{} (-0.125,1)[$P$]{} (1.125,1)[$Q$]{} (1.125,0)[$R$]{}\n\nthen $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_4$ above are no longer collineations of\n$\\mathscr{S}$. The resulting set is the Klein 4-group.\n\nWhat we have seen is true in general: the set of all collineation on a\nnear-linear space $\\mathscr{S}$ is a group under functional composition.\nThis group is sometimes written $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathscr{S})$.\n\n**Example 2**. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over some\ndivision ring $D$, with $n\\ge 3$. One may form the affine space $A(V)$\nover $V$. The points and lines of $A(V)$ are respectively cosets of zero\nand one dimensional subspaces of $V$, and $A(V)$ is a linear space.\nCollineations of $A(V)$ are called affinities. Common examples of\naffinities are translations, dilations, and reflections (with respect to\nlines).\n\n**Example 3**. Again let $V$ and $k$ be as in the last example. One may\nform the projective space $P(V)$ over $V$. The points and lines of\n$P(V)$ are one and two dimensional subspaces of $V$, and $P(V)$ is a\nlinear space. Collineations of $P(V)$ are called projectivities.\n\nA point $P\\in \\mathcal{P}$ is called a fixed point of $\\sigma$ if\n$\\sigma(P)=P$. A line $\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}$ is a fixed line of $\\sigma$\nif $\\sigma(\\ell)=\\ell$. Note that $\\sigma$ fixes line $\\ell$ merely\nmeans that $\\sigma$ permutes the points on $\\ell$, and does not\nnecessarily fix them.\n\n**Definition**. Given a collineation $\\sigma$ on $\\mathscr{S}$, a\n*center* of $\\sigma$ is a point $P$ of $\\mathscr{S}$ such that $\\sigma$\nfixes all lines passing through $P$. An *axis* of $\\sigma$ is a\nhyperplane $\\pi$ of $\\mathscr{S}$ such that $\\sigma$ fixes all points in\n$\\pi$. A collineation is said to be *central* if it has a center, and\n*axial* if it has an axis.\n\nIt can be shown that, in a projective space, central collineations are\nprecisely the same as axial collineations. Furthermore, if the (central)\ncollineation is not the identity, then it has a unique center and a\nunique axis. Given a projective space, non-identity central\ncollineations can further be classified: those with centers lying in\ntheir axes are called *elations*, and *homologies* otherwise.\n\n[7]{} L. M.
