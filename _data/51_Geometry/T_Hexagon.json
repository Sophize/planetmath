  "definition": "An *hexagon* is a $6$-sided polygon. The most commonly quoted hexagon is\na hexagon, having congruent sides and congruent interior angles. Below\nis an example of a regular hexagon:\n\n(0,0)(6,5.2) (0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n(0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n\nBelow are some properties of regular hexagons in Euclidean geometry:\n\n-   The of any interior angle of a regular hexagon is $120^{\\circ}$.\n\n-   The smallest $n$ for which a regular $n$-gon has diagonals which are\n    not congruent is $n=6$. For example, in the regular hexagon below,\n    the diagonal drawn in blue and the one drawn in red are not\n    congruent.\n\n    (0,0)(6,5.2) (1.5,0)(1.5,5.196) (4.5,0)(1.5,5.196)\n    (0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n    (0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n\n-   The side of a regular hexagon has the same length as the radius of\n    the circle circumscribing it. This fact is illustrated below.\n\n    (0,-0.2)(6,5.2) (3,2.598)[3]{} (3,2.598)(1.5,5.196)\n    (0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n    (3,2.598)(0,2.598)(1.5,0)(4.5,0)(6,2.598)(4.5,5.196)(1.5,5.196)\n\nFrom the last remark, it is easy to see that a regular hexagon is\nconstructible using compass and straightedge.",
