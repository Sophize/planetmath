  "definition": "In the parent entry, we constructed a coordinate system in a projective\nplane. We used a set $\\mathcal{R}$ of labels for the points on the\nidentity line as \u201cvalues\u201d for the coordinates. In this entry, we will\nequip $\\mathcal{R}$ with some operations based on properties of the\nprojective plane, and turn $\\mathcal{R}$ into an algebraic system. In\nfact, we show that $\\mathcal{R}$ with the operations is a ternary ring.\n\nLet $\\pi$ be a projective plane, coordinatized by a set $\\mathcal{R}$ of\nsymbols, which includes $0$ and $1$. Let $\\ell$ be the designated line\nof infinity, and $Y$ the intersection of $\\ell$ and the $Y$-axis. Below\nis a table showing forms of coordinates that points and lines of $\\pi$\nmay have:\n\n                  points                                          lines\n  -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n   $(x,y)$ if they do not lie on $\\ell$        $[\\,m,b\\,]$ if they do not pass through $Y$\n   $(m)$ if they lie $\\ell$ but not $Y$   $[\\,x\\,]$ if they pass through $Y$ but are not $\\ell$\n    $(\\infty)$ if it is the point $Y$                $[\\,\\infty\\,]$ if it is $\\ell$\n\nWhat are the relationships between the coordinates of lines and the\ncoordinates of those points incident with the lines? There are three\ncases:\n\n1.  If the line is $[\\,\\infty\\,]$, the points on it have the form $(m)$,\n    where $m\\in \\mathcal{R}\\cup \\lbrace \\infty\\rbrace$,\n\n2.  If the line is of the form $[\\,x\\,]$ where $x\\ne \\infty$, the points\n    on it (other than $Y$ itself) have the form $(x,y)$,\n\n3.  If the line is of the form $[\\,m,b\\,]$, then a point on it either\n    has the form $(x,y)$ or is $(m)$.\n\nThe last case is the most interesting. In particular, what is the\nrelationship among $m,b,x,y$? The following four equations show us that\nany three of them determine the remaining one uniquely:\n\n[2]{}\n\n1.  $(0,b)(x,y)\\cap [\\,\\infty\\,]=(m)$,\n\n2.  $(m)(x,y)\\cap [\\,0\\,]=(0,b)$,\n\n3.  $(m)(0,b)\\cap [\\,x\\,]=(x,y)$,\n\n4.  $(m)(0,b) \\cap [\\,0,y\\,]=(x,y)$.\n\nEquations $S,T$ may be illustrated by the following figure:\n\n(-4,-2)(4,3) (-4,-3)(-1,3) (-4.5,-2.5)(3.5,-2.5) (3,-3)(-1.5,3)\n(-4,-1.35)(2.5,0) (-3.75,-2.5) (-1.2,2.6) (2.625,-2.5)\n(0.05,1.155)[$[\\,\\infty\\,]$]{} (-2,1.155)[$[\\,0\\,]$]{} (-3.0794,-1.1588)\n(0.9859,-0.3145) (-3.5,-1.1588)[$(0,b)$]{} (1.25,-0.5)[$(m)$]{}\n(-0.75,-0.675) (-0.75,-0.75)[$(x,y)$]{}\n\nand equations $U,V$ are illustrated by the next two figures below:\n\n(-3,-3)(3,3) (-4,-3)(-1,3) (-4.5,-2.5)(3.5,-2.5) (3,-3)(-1.5,3)\n(-4,-1.35)(2.5,0) (-3.75,-2.5) (-1.2,2.6) (2.625,-2.5) (-3.0794,-1.1588)\n(0.9859,-0.3145) (-3.5,-1.1588)[$(0,b)$]{} (1.25,-0.5)[$(m)$]{}\n(-0.75,-0.675) (-0.75,-0.85)[$(x,y)$]{} (-0.85,0.5)[$[\\,x\\,]$]{}\n(-1.255,3)(-0.4305,-3)\n\n(-3,-3)(3,3) (-4,-3)(-1,3) (-4.5,-2.5)(3.5,-2.5) (3,-3)(-1.5,3)\n(-4,-1.35)(2.5,0) (-3.75,-2.5) (-1.2,2.6) (2.625,-2.5) (-3.0794,-1.1588)\n(0.9859,-0.3145) (-3.5,-1.1588)[$(0,b)$]{} (1.25,-0.5)[$(m)$]{}\n(-0.75,-0.675) (-0.75,-0.675)[$(x,y)$]{} (-0.15,-1.25)[$[\\,0,y\\,]$]{}\n(-3,0.5417)(3.5497,-3)\n\nAs a result, the four equations above define four partial functions\n$S,T,U,V: \\mathcal{R}^3 \\to \\mathcal{R}$, where\n$$S(b,x,y)=m,\\quad T(m,x,y)=b,\\quad U(x,m,b)=y,\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad V(y,m,b)=x.$$\nOut of the four partial functions, $T,U,V$ are total. $S$ is not,\nbecause $S(b,0,y)$ does not exist, as\n$(0,b)(0,y)\\cap [\\,\\infty\\,]=(\\infty)$. It is easy to see that all four\npartial functions are onto.\n\nIn light of the discussion above, we see that $(\\mathcal{R},0,1,F)$ is\nan algebraic system, where $F$ is any of the three total functions. In\nthe literature, $F=U$ is the choice. For the remainder of the\ndiscussion, we write $y=x*m*b$ to denote $y=U(x,m,b)$.\n\n$(\\mathcal{R},0,1,*)$ is a ternary ring.\n\nThere are five conditions to verify:\n\n1.  Since $(0)(0,b)\\cap [\\,x\\,]=(x,b)$, we have $x*0*b=b$. Since\n    $(m)(0,b)\\cap [\\,0\\,]=(0,b)$, we have $0*m*b=b$.\n\n2.  Next, since $(m)(0,0)\\cap [\\,1\\,]=(1,m)$, we have $1*m*0=m$, and\n    since $(1)(0,0)\\cap [\\,x\\,]=(x,x)$, we have $x*1*0=x$.\n\n3.  Given $m_1\\ne m_2$ and $b_1,b_2$, we have two distinct lines\n    $[\\,m_1,b_1\\,]$ and $[\\,m_2,b_2\\,]$, which intersect at a unique\n    point $(x,y)$, whence $x*m_1*b_1=y=x*m_2*b_2$.\n\n4.  Given $m,x,y$, have two points $(m)$ and $(x,y)$, both incident with\n    line $(m)(x,y)$. This line is not $[\\,\\infty\\,]$, which means that\n    it intersects the $Y$-axis $[\\,0\\,]$ at $(0,b)$ for some unique $b$,\n    whence $x*m*b=y$.\n\n5.  Given $x_1\\ne x_2$ and $y_1,y_2$, we have two distinct points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. The line $(x_1,y_1)(x_2,y_2)$ does not\n    pass through $Y(=(\\infty))$, or else it has coordinate $[\\,x\\,]$ for\n    some $x$, forcing $x_1=x=x_2$. As a result $(x_1,y_1)(x_2,y_2)$\n    intersects $[\\,\\infty\\,]$ at $(m)$ for some $m\\ne \\infty$, and\n    intersects $[\\,0\\,]$ at $(0,b)$ for some $b$. In other words,\n    $(x_1,y_1)(x_2,y_2)=[\\,m,b\\,]$, or, equivalently, $x_1*m*b=y_1$ and\n    $x_2*m*b=y_2$. The pair $(m,b)$ is clearly unique.\n\nThis shows that $\\mathcal{R}$, together with $0,1$ and the ternary\noperation $*$, is a ternary ring.\n\nIt is easy to see that points $(x,y)$ on lines with coordinates of the\nform $[\\,m,b\\,]$ satisfy equations of the form $y=x*m*b$, and points\n$(x,y)$ (except the point $(\\infty)$) on lines with coordinates of the\nform $[\\,a\\,]$, where $a\\ne \\infty$, satisfy equations of the form\n$x=a$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   We call $\\mathcal{R}$ the ternary ring of the projective plane $\\pi$\n    determined by the quadrangle $O,I,X,Y$. We also call $\\mathcal{R}$ a\n    coordinate ring of $\\pi$. If we are given a different quadrangle, we\n    will end up with a different coordinate ring for $\\pi$, and the two\n    ternary rings may not be isomorphic.\n\n-   It can be shown that any ternary ring is a coordinate ring for some\n    projective plane.
