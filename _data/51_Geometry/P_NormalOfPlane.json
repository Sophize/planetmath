  "statement": "The perpendicular or normal line of a plane is a special case of the\nsurface normal, but may be defined separately as follows:\n\nA line $l$ is a [*normal of a plane*]{} $\\pi$, if it intersects the\nplane and is perpendicular to all lines passing through the intersection\npoint in the plane. Then the plane $\\pi$ is a [*normal plane*]{} of the\nline $l$. The normal plane passing through the of a line segment is the\n[*center normal plane*]{} of the segment.\\\nThere is the\n\n**Theorem.** If a line ($l$) a plane ($\\pi$) and is perpendicular to two\ndistinct lines ($m$ and $n$) passing through the cutting point ($L$) in\nthe plane, then the line is a normal of the plane.\n\n(-3,-3.5)(3,4.1) (-3,-3.5)[.]{} (3,4)[.]{} (-1.5,1)(-2.5,-1)\n(-1.5,1)(1.43,1) (1.55,1)(3,1) (-2.5,-1)(2,-1) (2,-1)(3,1)\n(1.5,3.8)(1.5,0.3) (1.5,0.3) (1.5,-1)(1.5,-3) (-1.5,1)(2,-1)\n(1.5,0.3)(-1.8,0.4) (1.5,0.3)(-2.5,-1) (1.5,0.3)(0.5,-1)\n(1.35,3.8)[$l$]{} (2.7,0.8)[$\\pi$]{} (1.75,0.37)[$L$]{}\n(-0.43,0.15)[$M$]{} (0.30,-0.35)[$N$]{} (1.15,-0.35)[$A$]{} (-0.37,0.35)\n(0.36,-0.08) (0.95,-0.4) (1.5,3.3)(1.5,-2.7) (1.5,3.3)(-0.37,0.35)\n(1.5,3.3)(0.36,-0.08) (1.5,3.3)(0.95,-0.40) (1.75,3.3)[$P$]{}\n(1.76,-2.7)[$Q$]{} (-1.45,0.21)[$m$]{} (-1.7,-0.60)[$n$]{}\n(0.45,-0.77)[$a$]{}\n\n[*Proof.*]{} Let $a$ be an arbitrary line passing through the point $L$\nin the plane $\\pi$. We need to show that $a \\perp l$. Set another line\nof the plane cutting the lines $m$, $n$ and $a$ at the points $M$, $N$\nand $A$, respectively. Separate from $l$ the equally segments $LP$ and\n$LQ$. Then $$PM \\;=\\; QM \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad PN \\;=\\; QN,$$ since any\npoint of the center normal of a line segment ($PQ$) is equidistant from\nthe end points of the segment. Consequently,\n$$\\Delta MNP \\cong \\Delta MNQ \\quad(\\mbox{SSS}).$$ Thus the segments\n$PA$ and $QA$, being corresponding parts of two congruent triangles, are\nequally long. I.e., the point $A$ is equidistant from the end points of\nthe segment $PQ$, and it must be on the of $PQ$. Therefore $AL \\bot PQ$,\ni.e. $a \\bot l$.\\\n**Proposition 1.** All of a plane are parallel. If a line is parallel to\na normal of a plane, then it is a normal of the plane, too.\n\n**Proposition 2.** All normal planes of a line are parallel. If a plane\nis parallel to a normal plane of a line, then also it is a normal plane\nof the line.",
