  "definition": "In the vector space ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, the word [*origin*]{} refers to\nthe zero point, that is the point $(0,\\ldots,0)$. Similarly for\n${\\mathbb{C}}^n$. definitions can be made for any vector space. Often\nthe notation $0$ or $O$ is used for the origin.\n\nIn some contexts the choice of \u201corigin\u201d can be arbitrary and thus not\nnatural. For example, if we think of Euclidean space as an affine space\nor as a Riemannian manifold, it has no natural origin. Many theorems\nabout local properties of manifolds are stated for values near the\norigin in some vector space. This is because any point on the manifold\ncan be the origin in some set of local coordinates.",
