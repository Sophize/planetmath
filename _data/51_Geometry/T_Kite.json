  "definition": "A *kite* or *deltoid* is a quadrilateral with two pairs of equal sides,\neach pair consisting of adjacent sides. Contrast with parallelograms,\nwhere the equal sides are opposite.\n\n![image](GeometricKite.eps)\n\nThe pairs of equal sides imply several properties:\n\n-   One diagonal divides the kite into two isosceles triangles, and the\n    other divides the kite into two congruent triangles.\n\n-   The angles between the sides of unequal length are equal. In the\n    picture, they are both equal to the sum of the blue angle with the\n    red angle.\n\n-   The diagonals are perpendicular.\n\n-   If $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals, then the area\n    is $$A=\\frac{d_1d_2}{2}$$ Alternatively, if $a$ and $b$ are the\n    lengths of the sides, and $\\theta$ the angle between unequal sides,\n    then the area is $$A={a b \\sin\\theta}.$$\n\n-   A kite possesses an inscribed circle. That is, there exists a circle\n    that is tangent (touches) the four sides.\n\n-   Kites always possess at least one symmetry axis, being the diagonal\n    that divides it into two congruent triangle.\n\nWhen all the side lengths are the same, the kite becomes a rhombus, and\nwhen both diagonals have the same length, the kite becomes a square.",
