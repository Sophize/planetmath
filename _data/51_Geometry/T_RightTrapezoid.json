  "definition": "A *right trapezoid* is a trapezoid that has at least two right angles.\nBelow is a picture of a right trapezoid.\n\n(0,0)(4,2) (0,0)(1,2)(4,2)(4,0)\n\nIn some dialects of English ( British English), this figure is referred\nto as a *right trapezium*. Because of the modifier \u201cright\u201d, no confusion\nshould arise with this usage.\n\nAll rectangles are right trapezoids (unless the definition of trapezoid\nis used, see the entry on for more details). Note also that, in\nEuclidean geometry, a trapezoid cannot have an odd number of right\nangles.\n\nA is a trapezoid that is simultaneously a right trapezoid and an\nisosceles trapezoid. In Euclidean geometry, such trapezoids are\nautomatically rectangles. In hyperbolic geometry, such trapezoids are\nautomatically Saccheri quadrilaterals. Thus, the phrase \u201cright isosceles\ntrapezoid\u201d occurs rarely.\n\nRight trapezoids are used in the trapezoidal rule and composite\ntrapezoidal rule for estimating Riemann integrals.",
