  "definition": "Let $\\mathscr{S}_1=(\\mathcal{P}_1,\\mathcal{L}_1)$ and\n$\\mathscr{S}_2=(\\mathcal{P}_2,\\mathcal{L}_2)$ be two near-linear spaces.\n\n**Definition**. A *linear function* from $\\mathscr{S}_1$ to\n$\\mathscr{S}_2$ is a mapping on the points that sends lines of\n$\\mathscr{S}_1$ to lines of $\\mathscr{S}_2$. In other words, a linear\nfunction is a function $\\sigma: \\mathcal{P}_1 \\to \\mathcal{P}_2$ such\nthat\n$$\\sigma(\\ell)\\in \\mathcal{L}_2\\mbox{ for every }\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}_1.$$\nHere, $\\sigma(\\ell)$ is the set\n$\\lbrace \\sigma(P)\\mid P\\in \\ell \\rbrace$. A linear function is also\ncalled a homomorphism.\n\nWhen both $\\mathscr{S}_1$ and $\\mathscr{S}_2$ are linear spaces, then\n$\\sigma$ being a linear function is equvalent to saying that $P,Q$ are\ncollinear iff $\\sigma(P),\\sigma(Q)$ are collinear.\n\nIf $\\mathscr{S}_1$ is a linear space, then so is\n$(\\sigma(\\mathcal{P}_1),\\sigma(\\mathcal{L}_1))$. This shows that if\n$\\sigma: \\mathscr{S}_1\\to \\mathscr{S}_1$ is onto, $\\mathscr{S}_2$ is a\nlinear space if $\\mathscr{S}_1$ is.\n\nLet $\\sigma: \\mathscr{S}_1\\to \\mathscr{S}_2$ be a one-to-one linear\nfunction. If points $P_1\\ne P_2$ lie on line $\\ell$, then\n$\\sigma(P_1)\\ne \\sigma(P_2)$ lie on $\\sigma(\\ell)$. This also shows that\nthree collinear points in $\\mathscr{S}_1$ are mapped to three collinear\npoints in $\\mathscr{S}_2$. In addition, we have\n\n$|\\ell|=|\\sigma(\\ell)|$ for any line $\\ell$ in $\\mathscr{S}_1$.\n\n**Definition**. When $\\sigma:\\mathscr{S}_1\\to \\mathscr{S}_2$ is a\nbijection whose inverse $\\sigma^{-1}$ is also linear, we say that\n$\\sigma$ is an isomorphism. When\n$\\mathscr{S}_1=\\mathscr{S}_2=\\mathscr{S}$, we call $\\sigma$ an\nautomorphism, or more commonly among geometers, a *collineation*, of the\nspace $\\mathscr{S}$.\n\nSuppose $\\sigma:\\mathscr{S}_1\\to \\mathscr{S}_2$ is an isomorphism. For\nevery point $P$, let $P^*$ be the set of all lines passing through $P$.\nThen\n\n$|P^*|=|\\sigma(P)^*|$ for any point $P$ in $\\mathscr{S}_1$.\n\nIt is possible to have a bijective linear function whose inverse is not\nlinear. For example, let $\\mathscr{S}_1$ be the space with two points\n$P,Q$ with no lines, and $\\mathscr{S}_2$ the space with the same two\npoints with line $\\lbrace P,Q\\rbrace$. Then the identity function on\n$\\lbrace P,Q\\rbrace$ is a bijective linear function whose inverse is not\nlinear. On the other hand, if the both spaces are linear, then the\ninverse is always linear.\n\n**Remark**. The usage of the term \u201clinear function\u201d differs from its\nmore usual meaning as a linear transformation between vector spaces in\nthe study of linear algebra.\n\n[7]{} L. M.
