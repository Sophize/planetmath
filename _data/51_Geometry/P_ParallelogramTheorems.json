And since the line\n$BD$ also cuts the parallel lines $AB$ and $DC$, the alternate interior\nangles $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ are congruent. Moreover, the triangles\n$ABD$ and $CDB$ have a common side $BD$. Thus, these triangles are\ncongruent (ASA). Accordingly, the corresponding sides are congruent:\n$AB = DC$ and $AD = BC$.\n\n**Theorem 2.** If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are\ncongruent, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\n\n**Theorem 3.** If one pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are both\nparallel and congruent, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\n\n**Theorem 4.** The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n\n**Theorem 5.** If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other,\nthe quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\n\nAll of the above theorems hold in Euclidean geometry, but not in\nhyperbolic geometry. These theorems do not make sense in spherical\ngeometry because there are no parallelograms!",
