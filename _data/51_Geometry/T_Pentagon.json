  "definition": "A *pentagon* is a 5-sided planar polygon.\n\nRegular pentagons are of particular interest for geometers. On a regular\npentagon, the inner angles are equal to $108^\\circ$. All ten diagonals\nhave the same length. If $s$ is the length of a side and $d$ is the\nlength of a diagonal, then $$\\frac{d}{s}=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2};$$ that\nis, the ratio between a diagonal and a side is the Golden Number.\n\nA regular pentagon (along with its diagonals) can also be obtained as\nthe projection of a regular pentahedron in four dimensional space onto a\nplane determined by two opposite edges. This is analogous to the way a\nsquare with its diagonals can be obtained as the projection of a\ntetrahedrononto a plane determined by two opposite edges.",
