  "definition": "A *pencil* is a set of geometric objects, usually either congruent or\nsimilar to each other, that share a common incidence property. Below are\nsome of the most commonly encountered pencils:\n\n1.  A pencil of lines usually means a set of straight lines that are\n    incident with one point. If the lines all lie in the same plane, the\n    pencil is sometimes called a *flat pencil*.\n\n2.  In some cases, a pencil of lines denotes a set of parallel lines in\n    a plane. If a point of infinity is added to the plane, then we are\n    back to the previous example.\n\n3.  A pencil of circles can mean that either these circles all intersect\n    at exactly one point (or share the same tangent line)\n\n4.  A pencil of circles can also mean that the circles have two common\n    points of intersection.\n\n[8]{} E. Artin, [*Geometric Algebra*]{}, Wiley-Interscience, Reprint\n(1988). H. S. M.
