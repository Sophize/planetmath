  "definition": "A *regular polyhedron* is a polyhedron such that\n\n-   Every face is a regular polygon.\n\n-   On each vertex, the same number of edges concur.\n\n-   The dihedral angle between any two faces is always the same.\n\nThese polyhedra are also known as Platonic solids, since Plato described\nthem in his work. There are only 5 regular polyhedra, as was first shown\nby Theaetetus, one of Plato\u2019s students. Some sources ascribe to\nTheaetetus also the discovery of the dodecahedron.\n\nThe five solids are:\n\nRegular Tetrahedron\n\n:   It has 6 edges and 4 vertices and 4 faces, each one being an\n    equilateral triangle. Its symmetry group is $S_4$.\n\nRegular Hexahedron\n\n:   Also known as cube. It has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces each one\n    being a square. Its symmetry group is $S_4\\times C_2$.\n\nRegular Octahedron\n\n:   It has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces, each one being an\n    equilateral triangle Its symmetry group is $S_4\\times C_2$.\n\nRegular Dodecahedron\n\n:   It has 20 vertices, 30 edges and 12 faces, each one being a regular\n    pentagon. Its symmetry group is $A_5\\times C_2$.\n\nRegular Icosahedron\n\n:   It has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 faces, each one being an\n    equilateral triangle. Its symmetry group is $A_5\\times C_2$.\n\n![The five Platonic solids \u2013 created in Blender 2.36.
