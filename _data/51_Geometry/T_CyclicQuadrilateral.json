  "definition": "**Cyclic quadrilateral.**\\\nA quadrilateral is cyclic when its four vertices lie on a circle.\n\n![image](quadcyclic)\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be cyclic,\nis that the sum of a pair of opposite angles be equal to $180^\\circ$.\n\nOne of the main results about these quadrilaterals is Ptolemy\u2019s theorem.\n\nAlso, from all the quadrilaterals with given sides $p,q,r,s$, the one\nthat is cyclic has the greatest area. If the four sides of a cyclic\nquadrilateral are known, the area can be found using Brahmagupta\u2019s\nformula",
