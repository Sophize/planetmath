  "definition": "A polygon is *equilateral* if all of its sides are congruent.\n\nCommon examples of equilateral polygons are rhombi and regular polygons\nsuch as equilateral triangles and squares.\n\nLet $T$ be a triangle in Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry, or\nspherical geometry. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n-   $T$ is equilateral;\n\n-   $T$ is equiangular;\n\n-   $T$ is regular.\n\nIf $ T$ is allowed to be a polygon that has more than three sides, then\nthe above statement is no longer true in any of the indicated\ngeometries.\n\nBelow are some pictures of equilateral polygons that are not\nequiangular.\n\n(0,0)(17,6) (0,0)(3,2.25)(6.75,2.25)(3.75,0)\n(7.5,0)(10.5,0)(10.5,3)(9,5.598)(7.5,3)\n(11.268,1)(13,2)(15,2)(16.732,1)(15,0)(13,0)",
