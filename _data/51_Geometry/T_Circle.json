  "definition": "A *circle* is the locus of points which are equidistant from some fixed\npoint. It is in the plane is determined by a *center* and a *radius*.\nThe center is a point in the plane, and the length of the radius is a\npositive real number, the radius being a line segment from the center to\nthe circumference. The circle consists of all points whose distance from\nthe center equals the radius.\n\nAnother way of defining the circle is thus: Given $A$ and $P$ as two\npoints and $O$ as another point, the circle with center $O$ is the locus\nof points $X$ with $OX$ congruent to $AP$. (Hilbert, 1927)\n\nNotice there is no definition of distance needed to make that definition\nand so it works in many geometries, even ones with no distance function.\nHilbert uses it in his Foundations of Geometry book Also used by Forder\nin his Foundations of Euclidean geometry book, c 1927\n\nIn this entry, we only work with the standard Euclidean norm in the\nplane. A circle has one center only.\n\nA circle determines a closed curve in the plane, and this curve is\ncalled the *perimeter* or *circumference* of the circle. If the radius\nof a circle is $r$, then the length of the perimeter is $2\\pi r$. Also,\nthe area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$. More precisely, the interior of the\nperimeter has area $\\pi r^2$. The *diameter* of a circle is defined as\n$d = 2r$.\n\nThe circle is a special case of an ellipse. Also, in three dimensions,\nthe analogous geometric object to a circle is a sphere.\n\nLet us next derive an analytic equation for a circle in Cartesian\ncoordinates $(x,y)$. If the circle has center $(a,b)$ and radius\n$r > 0$, we obtain the following condition for the points of the sphere,\n$$\\label{firsteq}\n(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2.$$ In other words, the circle is the set of\nall points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the above equation. In the special case\nthat $a = b = 0$, the equation is simply $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. The *unit\ncircle* is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n\nIt is clear that equation \\[firsteq\\] can always be reduced to the form\n$$\\label{secondeq}\nx^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,$$ where $D,E,F$ are real numbers.\nConversely, suppose that we are given an equation of the above form\nwhere $D,E,F$ are arbitrary real numbers. Next we derive conditions for\nthese constants, so that equation\u00a0 determines a circle [@kindle].\nCompleting the squares yields\n$$x^2 + Dx + \\frac{D^2}{4} + y^2 + Ey + \\frac{E^2}{4} =  - F + \\frac{D^2}{4} +  \\frac{E^2}{4},$$\nwhence\n$$\\left(x + \\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(y + \\frac{E}{2}\\right)^2 =  \\frac{D^2 - 4F + E^2}{4}.$$\nThere are three cases:\n\n1.  If $D^2 - 4F + E^2 > 0$, then equation\u00a0 determines a circle with\n    center $( - \\frac{D}{2}, - \\frac{E}{2})$ and radius\n    $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{D^2 - 4F + E^2}$.\n\n2.  If $D^2 - 4F + E^2 = 0$, then equation\u00a0 determines the point\n    $( - \\frac{D}{2}, - \\frac{E}{2})$.\n\n3.  If $D^2 - 4F + E^2<0$, then equation\u00a0 has no (real) solution in the\n    $(x,y)$ - plane.\n\nThe circle in polar coordinates\n===============================\n\nUsing polar coordinates for the plane, we can parameterize the circle.\nConsider the circle with center $(a,b)$ and radius $r > 0$ in the plane\n${\\mathbb{R}}^2$. It is then natural to introduce polar coordinates\n$(\\rho, \\phi)$ for ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\setminus\\{(a,b)\\}$ by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx(\\rho, \\phi) & =  a + \\rho \\cos \\phi, \\\\\ny(\\rho, \\phi) & =  b + \\rho \\sin \\phi,\\end{aligned}$$ with $\\rho > 0$\nand $\\phi\\in [0,2\\pi)$. Since we wish to parameterize the circle, the\npoint $(a,b)$ does not pose a problem; it is not part of the circle.\nPlugging these expressions for $x,y$ into equation\u00a0 yields the condition\n$\\rho = r$. The given circle is thus parameterization by\n$\\phi\\mapsto (a + \\rho \\cos \\phi, b + \\rho \\sin \\phi)$,\n$\\phi\\in[0,2\\pi)$. It follows that a circle is a closed curve in the\nplane.\n\nThree point formula for the circle\n==================================\n\nSuppose we are given three points on a circle, say $(x_1, y_1)$,\n$(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$. We next derive expressions for the\nparameters $D,E,F$ in terms of these points. We also derive equation\u00a0,\nwhich gives an equation for a circle in terms of a determinant.\n\nFirst, from equation\u00a0, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\nx_1^2 + y_1^2 + Dx_1 + Ey_1 + F & =  0, \\\\\nx_2^2 + y_2^2 + Dx_2 + Ey_2 + F & =  0, \\\\\nx_3^2 + y_3^2 + Dx_3 + Ey_3 + F & =  0.\\end{aligned}$$ These equations\nform a linear set of equations for $D,E,F$, i.e., $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\\n x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\\n x_3 & y_3 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\cdot\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n D  \\\\E \\\\F \n\\end{pmatrix} \n =  \n - \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1^2 + y_1^2   \\\\\nx_2^2 + y_2^2  \\\\\nx_3^2 + y_3^2  \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix}.$$ Let us denote the matrix on the left hand side by\n$\\Lambda$. Also, let us assume that $\\det \\Lambda \\neq 0$. Then, using\nCramer\u2019s rule, we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\nD & =   - \\frac{1}{\\det \\Lambda} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1^2 + y_1^2  & y_1 & 1 \\\\\n x_2^2 + y_2^2  & y_2 & 1 \\\\\n x_3^2 + y_3^2 & y_3 & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix}, \\\\\nE & =   - \\frac{1}{\\det \\Lambda} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & x_1^2 + y_1^2  & 1 \\\\\n x_2 & x_2^2 + y_2^2  & 1 \\\\\n x_3 & x_3^2 + y_3^2  & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix}, \\\\\nF & =   - \\frac{1}{\\det \\Lambda} \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & y_1 & x_1^2 + y_1^2 \\\\\n x_2 & y_2 & x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\\\\n x_3 & y_3 & x_3^2 + y_3^2 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{aligned}$$ These equations give the parameters\n$D,E,F$ as functions of the three given points. Substituting these\nequations into equation\u00a0 yields $$\\begin{aligned}\n(x^2 + y^2)\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\\n x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\\n x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix}  &\\mathbin{ - } x\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1^2 + y_1^2  & y_1 & 1 \\\\\n x_2^2 + y_2^2  & y_2 & 1 \\\\\n x_3^2 + y_3^2 & y_3 & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&\\mathbin{ - } y\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & x_1^2 + y_1^2  & 1 \\\\\n x_2 & x_2^2 + y_2^2  & 1 \\\\\n x_3 & x_3^2 + y_3^2  & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n &\\mathbin{ - } \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x_1 & y_1 & x_1^2 + y_1^2 \\\\\n x_2 & y_2 & x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\\\\n x_3 & y_3 & x_3^2 + y_3^2 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix} = 0.\\end{aligned}$$ Using the cofactor expansion, we can\nnow write the equation for the circle passing through\n$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3)$ as [@weissteincirc; @beta]\n$$\\label{determ}\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n x^2 + y^2 & x & y & 1 \\\\\n x_1^2 + y_1^2 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\\n x_2^2 + y_2^2 & x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\\n x_3^2 + y_3^2 & x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\\\\n \\end{pmatrix} = 0.$$\n\n[9]{} D.
