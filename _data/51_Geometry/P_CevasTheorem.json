If $X$ is\nthe intersection point of $AP$ with $BC$, $Y$ the intersection point of\n$BP$ with $CA$ and $Z$ is the intersection point of $CP$ with $AB$, then\n$$\\frac{AZ}{ZB}\\cdot\\frac{BX}{XC}\\cdot\\frac{CY}{YA}=1.$$\n\nConversely, if $X,Y,Z$ are points on $BC,CA,AB$ respectively, and if\n$$\\frac{AZ}{ZB}\\cdot\\frac{BX}{XC}\\cdot\\frac{CY}{YA}=1$$ then $AX,BY,CZ$\nare concurrent.\n\nRemarks: All the segments are directed segments (that is $AB=-BA$), and\nso theorem is valid even if the points $X,Y,Z$ are in the prolongations\n(even at the infinity) and $P$ is any point on the plane (or at the\ninfinity).\n\n![image](ceva)",
