The same holds in three-dimensional\nspace.\n\nFor triangles, pentagons, and higher , it is customary to refer to the\nlength of any of its sides as the *length of the* . The length of a\ncircle\u2019s side is called its circumference.\n\nIn set theory, *length* refers to the number of elements a set (or\none-dimensional array) has. This is also known as cardinality. For\nexample, $\\{2, 5, 11, 23, 47\\}$ has length $5$.",
