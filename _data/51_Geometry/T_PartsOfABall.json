  "definition": "Let us consider in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ a ball of radius $r$ and the sphere\nbounding the ball.\n\n-   Two parallel planes intersecting the ball separate between them from\n    the ball a [*spherical segment*]{}, which can also be called a\n    [*spherical frustum*]{} (see the frustum). The curved surface of the\n    spherical segment is the [*spherical zone*]{}.\n\n-   In the special case that one of the planes is a tangent plane of the\n    sphere, the spherical segment is a [*spherical cap*]{} and the\n    spherical zone is a [*spherical calotte*]{}.\n\n-   The lateral surface of a circular cone with its apex in the of the\n    ball divides the ball into two [*spherical sectors*]{}.\n\nThe distance $h$ of the two planes intersecting the ball be is called\nthe [*height*]{}.\n\nThe volume of the spherical cap is obtained from\n$$V \\,=\\, \\pi h^2\\left(r\\!-\\!\\frac{h}{3}\\right)$$ and the area of the\ncorresponding spherical calotte and also a spherical zone from\n$$A \\,=\\, 2\\pi rh.$$ The volume of a spherical segment can be got as the\ndifference of the volumes of two spherical caps.\n\nThe volume of a spherical sector may be calculated from\n$$V \\,=\\, \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^2h,$$ where $h$ is the height of the\nspherical cap of the spherical sector.",
