  "definition": "The **nine point circle** also known as the **Euler\u2019s circle** or the\n**Feuerbach circle** is the circle that passes through the feet of\nperpendiculars from the vertices $A, B$ and $C$ of a triangle\n$\\triangle ABC.$\n\n![image](feuerbachkreis.eps)\n\nSome of the properties of this circle are:\n\n**Property 1 :** This circle also passes through the midpoints of the\nsides $AB, BC$ and $CA$ of $\\triangle ABC.$ This was shown by Euler.\n\n**Property 2 :** Feuerbach showed that this circle also passes through\nthe midpoints of the line segments $AH, BH$ and $CH$ which are drawn\nfrom the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$ to its orthocenter $H.$\n\nThese three triples of points make nine in all, giving the circle its\nname.\n\n**Property 3 :** The radius of the nine-point cirlce is $R/2,$ where $R$\nis the circumradius (radius of the circumcircle).\n\n**Property 4 :** The center of the nine-point circle is the midpoint of\nthe line segment joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and hence\nlies on the Euler line.\n\n**Property 5 :** All triangles inscribed in a given circle and having\nthe same orthocenter, have the same nine-point circle.",
