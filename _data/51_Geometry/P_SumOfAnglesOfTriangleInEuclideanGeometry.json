In the plane of the triangle we set the\nlines $AD$ and $AE$ such that $\\wedge BAD = \\beta$ and\n$\\wedge CAE = \\gamma$. Then the lines do not intersect the line $BC$. In\nfact, if e.g. $AD$ would intersect $BC$ in a point $P$, then there would\nexist a triangle $ABP$ where an of an angle would equal to an interior\nangle of another angle which is impossible. Thus $AD$ and $AE$ are both\nparallel to $BC$. By the parallel postulate, these lines have to\ncoincide. This means that the addition of the triangle angles $\\alpha$,\n$\\beta$, $\\gamma$ gives a straight angle.\n\nSee also !\n\n[8]{} : [*Lobatsevski geomeetria*]{}.
