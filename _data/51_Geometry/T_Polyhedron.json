  "definition": "At least four definitions of a polyhedron are used.\n\nCombinatorics {#combinatorics .unnumbered}\n-------------\n\nIn combinatorics a *polyhedron* is the solution set of a finite system\nof linear inequalities. The solution set is in ${{\\mathbbmss{R}}}^n$ for\ninteger $n$. Hence, it is a convex set. Each extreme point of such a\npolyhedron is also called a *vertex* (or *corner point*) of the\npolyhedron. A solution set could be empty. If the solution set is\nbounded (that is, is contained in some sphere) the polyhedron is said to\nbe *bounded*.\n\nElementary Geometry {#elementary-geometry .unnumbered}\n-------------------\n\nIn elementary geometry a polyhedron is a solid bounded by a finite\nnumber of plane faces, each of which is a polygon. This of course is not\na precise definition as it relies on the undefined term \u201csolid\u201d. Also,\nthis definition allows a polyhedron to be non-convex.\n\nCareful Treatments of Geometry {#careful-treatments-of-geometry .unnumbered}\n------------------------------\n\nIn treatments of geometry that are carefully done a definition due to\nLennes is sometimes used [@LE]. The intent is to rule out certain\nobjects that one does not want to consider and to simplify the theory of\ndissection. A polyhedron is a set of points consisting of a finite set\nof triangles $T$, not all coplanar, and their interiors such that\n\n-   every side of a triangle is common to an even number of triangles of\n    the set, and\n\n-   there is no subset $T'$ of $T$ such that (i) is true of a proper\n    subset of $T'$.\n\nNotice that condition (ii) excludes, for example, two cubes that are\ndisjoint. But two tetrahedra having a common edge are allowed. The faces\nof the polyhedron are the insides of the triangles. Note that the\ncondition that the faces be triangles is not important, since a polygon\nan be dissected into triangles. Also note since a triangle meets an\n*even* number of other triangles, it is possible to meet 4,6 or any\nother even number of triangles. So for example, a configuration of 6\ntetrahedra all sharing a common edge is allowed.\n\nBy dissections of the triangles one can create a set of triangles in\nwhich no face intersects another face, edge or vertex. If this done the\npolyhedron is said to be **.\n\nA *convex polyhedron* is one such that all its inside points lie on one\nside of each of the planes of its faces.\n\nAn *Euler polyhedron* $P$ is a set of points consisting of a finite set\nof *polygons*, not all coplanar, and their insides such that\n\n-   each edge is common to just *two* polygons,\n\n-   there is a way using edges of $P$ from a given vertex to each\n    vertex, and\n\n-   any simple polygon $p$ made up of edges of $P$, divides the polygons\n    of $P$ into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that any way, whose points are\n    on $P$ from any point inside a polygon of $A$ to a point inside a\n    polygon of $B$, meets $p$.\n\nA *regular polyhedron* is a convex Euler polyhedron whose faces are\ncongruent regular polygons and whose dihedral angles are congruent.\n\nIt is a theorem, proved , that for a regular polyhedron, the number of\npolygons with the same vertex is the same for each vertex and that there\nare 5 types of regular polyhedra.\n\nNotice that a cone, and a cylinder are not polyhedra since they have\n\u201cfaces\u201d that are not polygons.\n\nA *simple polyhedron* is one that is homeomorphic to a sphere. For such\na polyhedron one has $V-E+F = 2$, where $V$ is the number of vertices,\n$E$ is the number of edges and $F$ is the number of faces. This is\ncalled Euler\u2019s formula.\n\nAlgebraic Topology {#algebraic-topology .unnumbered}\n------------------\n\nIn algebraic topology another definition is used:\n\nIf $K$ is a simplicial complex in ${{\\mathbbmss{R}}}^n$, then $|K|$\ndenotes the union of the elements of $K$, with the subspace topology\ninduced by the topology of ${{\\mathbbmss{R}}}^n$. $|K|$ is called a\n*polyhedron*. If $K$ is a finite complex, then $|K|$ is called a *finite\npolyhedron*.\n\nIt should be noted that we allow the complex to have an infinite number\nof simplexes. As a result, spaces such as ${\\mathbbmss{R}}$ and\n${{\\mathbbmss{R}}}^n$ are polyhedra.\n\nSome authors require the simplicial complex to be *locally finite*. That\nis, given $x \\in \\sigma \\in K$ there is a neighborhood of $x$ that meets\nonly finitely many $\\tau \\in K$.\n\n[99]{} Henry George Forder, *The Foundations of Euclidean Geometry*,\nDover Publications, New York , 1958.
