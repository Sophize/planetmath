  "definition": "When a straight line moves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ passing constantly through\na certain point $O$, the ruled surface it sweeps is called a [*conical\nsurface*]{} or a [*generalized cone*]{}. Formally and more generally, a\nconical surface $S$ is a ruled surface with the given condition:\n\n> there is a point $O$ on $S$, such that any ruling $\\ell$ on $S$ passes\n> through $O$.\n\nBy definition, it is readily seen that this point $O$ is unique, for\notherwise, all rulings of $S$ that pass through $O$ as well as another\npoint $O^{\\prime}$ must all coincide, concluding that $S$ must be\nnothing more than a straight line, contradicting the fact that $S$ is a\nsurface. The point $O$ is commonly known as the *apex* of the conical\nsurface $S$.\\\n\n![A circular conical surface](cone.eps)\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n-   No plane can be a conical surface, because one can always find a\n    line (ruling) on the plane not passing through $O$.\n\n-   A conical surface is, strictly speaking, not a (regular) surface in\n    the sense of a differentiable manifold. This is because of the\n    differentiability at the apex breaks down. In fact, no neighborhood\n    of the apex is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Nevertheless, it is\n    easy to see that any two points on a conical surface can be joined\n    by a simple continuous curve.\n\n-   Any plane passing through the apex $O$ of a conical surface $S$ must\n    contain at least two lines $\\ell,m$ through the apex such that\n    $\\ell\\cap S=m\\cap S=\\lbrace O\\rbrace$. In fact, it can be shown that\n    there is a plane with the above property such that $\\ell\\perp m$.\n\n-   Given a conical surface $S$, if there is a plane $\\pi$ in\n    $\\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\\pi\\cap S=\\varnothing$, then it can be\n    shown that $S$ is planar (that is, $S$ lies on a plane). This shows\n    that if $S$ is a non-planar surface, it must have non-empty\n    intersection with *any* plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$!\n\nGiven a plane $\\pi$ not passing through the apex $O$ of a non-planar\nconical surface $S$, the intersection of $\\pi$ and $S$ is non-empty, as\nguaranteed by the previous remark. Let $c$ be the intersection of $\\pi$\nand $S$. It is not hard to see that $c$ is necessarily a curve. The\ncurve may be bounded or unbounded, and it may have disjoint components.\nIf there is a plane not passing through the apex of a conical surface\n$S$, such that its intersection with $S$ is a bounded, connected closed\nloop, then we call this surface $S$ a *closed cone*, or *cone* for\nshort. Intuitively, it can be pictured as a surface swept out by a\nmoving straight line that returns to its starting position. Any plane\nnot passing through the apex of a closed cone $S$ intersects each ruling\nof $S$ at exactly one point.\n\nThe solid bounded by a closed cone $S$, a plane $\\pi$ not passing\nthrough the apex $O$ and the apex $O$ itself is called a *solid cone*.\nThe portion of the surface of the cone belonging to the conical surface\nis called the or the of the solid cone and the portion belonging to the\nplane is the [*base*]{} of the solid cone.\n\nThe intersections of a solid cone and the planes parallel to the base\nplane are similar. The perpendicular of the apex and the base plane is\nthe of the cone. The volume ($V$) of the cone equals to the third of\nproduct of the base area ($A$) and the ($h$): $$V = \\frac{Ah}{3}.$$ The\nformula can be derived directly by observing that, if we were to take\nanother parallel slice of the solid cone, the area $A(x)$ of the base\nfrom the slice is directly proportional to the square of the\ncorresponding height $x$. Integrating $A(x)$ with respect to $x$, where\n$x$ is between $0$ and $h$ gives us the above formula.\n\nIf the base of a cone is a polygon, the cone is called a [*pyramid*]{}\n(which is a polyhedron). The mantle of a pyramid consists of triangular\n[*faces*]{} having as common vertex the apex $O$. A pyramid is if its\nbase is a regular polygon and the of its base. A tetrahedron is an\nexample of a regular pyramid. Note that, in a regular pyramid, all of\nthe faces are isosceles. Colloquially, \u201cpyramid\u201d typically refers to a\nregular square pyramid.\n\nIf the base is a circle, the cone is called [*circular*]{}. If its of\nthe base circle, the circular cone is . Colloquially, \u201ccone\u201d typically\nrefers to a right circular cone.\n\nIn any cone, the line segment of a ruling between the base plane and the\napex is a of the cone. All are equally long only in a right circular\ncone. If in this case, the of the side line is $s$ and the radius of the\nbase circle $r$, then the area of the mantle of the right circular cone\nequals $\\pi{rs}$.",
