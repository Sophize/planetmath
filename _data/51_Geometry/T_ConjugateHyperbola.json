  "definition": "The simplest form of the equation presenting a (without the ) in a\nrectangular coordinate system is got when the coordinate axes coincide\nwith the axes of the hyperbola, and it has the form $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.\\end{aligned}$$ Here, $a\\, (>0)$ is\nthe and $b\\, (>0)$ the of the hyperbola.\n\nThe equation $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\\frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1\\end{aligned}$$ or\n$$\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2} = -1.$$ presents the [*conjugate\nhyperbola*]{} of (1). Its transverse axis is the conjugate axis of (1)\nand its conjugate axis the transverse axis of (1). Both hyperbolas are\nconjugate hyperbolas of each other. They have the common asymptotes\n$$\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0$$ and their foci are on the circle\n$x^2\\!+\\!y^2 = a^2\\!+\\!b^2$.\n\n(-5.5,-4.5)(5.5,4) (0,0)(-4.5,-3.5)(4.5,3.5) (-0.3,3.5)[$y$]{}\n(4.55,-0.3)[$x$]{} (-4.5,-3)(4.5,3) (-4.5,3)(4.5,-3)\n(-1.5,-1)(1.5,-1)(1.5,1)(-1.5,1) (0.87,-0.17)[$a$]{} (-0.14,0.59)[$b$]{}\n(0,0)[1.803]{} (1.803,0)(-1.803,0) (0,1.803)(0,-1.803) (0,-4.5)[Both\nhyperbolas with their common asymptotes $y = \\pm\\frac{b}{a}x$]{}",
