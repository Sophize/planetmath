  "statement": "(this proof is not correct yet)\n\nIn an ordered geometry a line segment has at most one midpoint.\n\nLet $[p,q]$ be a closed line segment and suppose $m$ and $m'$ are\nmidpoints. If $m:p:q$ then $[m,p] < [m,q]$ so $m$ is not a midpoint.\nSimilarly we cannot have $p:q:m$, so we have $p:m:q$. And also,\n$p:m':q$. Suppose $m \\not = m'$. Without loss of generality we can\nassume $p:m:m'$ and $m:m':q$. But then\n$[p,m'] > [p,m] \\cong [m,q] > [m',q]$ so that\n$[p,m'] \\not \\cong [m',q]$, a contradiction. Hence $m = m'$.",
