For any point\n$Q\\in\\ell_1$, we may form a line $m$ joining $P$ and $Q$. Then $m$\nintersects $\\ell_2$ at some point $R\\in\\ell_2$. This establishes a\none-to-one correspondence $\\rho$ from points lying on $\\ell_1$ to points\nlying on $\\ell_2$. Furthermore, if $O$ is the point of intersection of\n$\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$, then it is a fixed point of $\\rho$. Now, we can\nrepeat this procedure by picking another point $S$ not lying on either\n$\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$, and forming a bijection $\\sigma$ from $\\ell_2$ to\n$\\ell_1$ where again $\\sigma(O)=O$. If we take the composition\n$\\phi=\\sigma\\circ\\rho$, what we get is a bijection from $\\ell_1$ onto\nitself such that $O\\in\\ell_1$ is fixed by $\\phi$.\n\n(-5,-1)(5,4) (-4.75,0)(4.75,3) (-4.35,2.7)[$\\pi$]{}\n\n(1.5,0)(-0.5,3) (-0.5,3.1)[$\\ell_1$]{} (0.5,0)(2.5,3)\n(2.5,3.1)[$\\ell_2$]{} (1,0.75) (2.9,0.5)[$O=\\rho(O)=\\phi(O)$]{}\n\n(-3,2) (-3.2,2.2)[$P$]{} (0,2.25) (-0.5,2.25)[$Q$]{}\n(-4.75,1.854167)(4.75,2.645833) (5,2.6)[$m$]{} (2.117647,2.426471)\n(3,2.25)[$R=\\rho(Q)$]{}\n\n(-2.5,0.5) (-2.6,0.7)[$S$]{} (0.368771,1.696844) (0.1,0.9)[$\\phi(Q)$]{}\n(-3.69847,0)(3.492366,3)\n\nWe call this bijection $\\phi$ a perspectivity on $\\ell_1$ (via point\n$P$). $P$ is called the center of the perspectivity and a any bijection\nof coplanar lines in a projective space that arrises in the manner just\ndescribed is a perspectivity. Two points $Q$ and $T$ lying on $\\ell_1$\nare said to be perspective if there is a perspectivity $\\phi$ such that\n$T=\\phi(Q)$. It is easy to deduce that if $\\phi$ is a perspectivity on a\nline $\\ell$, then $\\phi^{-1}$ is also a perspectivity. So the relation\nof two points being perspective is a symmetric one. In addition, any\npoint is always perspective to itself (so the relation is reflexive),\nsince we can take the identity function as the required perspectivity.\n(Indeed the relation is trivial, see the closing remarks.)\n\nMoving one dimension up, we consider two planes $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$\nsitting in a three-dimensional projective space $V$. Then there are two\nbijections, one from $\\pi_1$ to $\\pi_2$, and the other from $\\pi_2$ to\n$\\pi_1$, such that their product is a bijection $\\phi$ of, say $\\pi_1$\nonto itself, such that $\\phi$ sends points to points, lines to lines,\nand fixes a line (the line of intersection of $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$).\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nGiven a projective geometry $PG(V)$ ($V$ a vector space over some field\n$k$), a projectivity $\\phi$ from $PG(V)$ onto itself (or an projective\nautomorphism) is called a *perspectivity* if it there exists a\nhyperplane $\\Pi\\in PG(V)$ such that $\\phi$ fixes every subspace $S$ of\n$\\Pi$, that is, $\\phi(S)=S$ for every $S\\le \\Pi$. A pair of points are\nsaid to be *perspective* if there is a perspectivity that maps one point\nto the other.\n\nCertainly any linear transformation that is the identity when restricted\nto a subspace of codimension 1 induces a perspectivity. Conversely, a\nperspectivity induces a linear transformation, if the underlying vector\nspace $V$ is at least three dimensional.\n\nAssume $\\operatorname{dim}(V)\\ge 3$. By the fundamental theorem of\nprojective geometry, a perspectivity $\\phi$ on $PG(V)$ induces a\nsemi-linear transformation $f$ on $V$. Now, by assumption, there is a\ntwo dimensional plane $\\Pi$, such that $\\phi(S)=S$ for all $S\\le \\Pi$.\nLet $kv$ and $kw$ be two points that span $\\Pi$ (so $v$ and $w$ are\nlinearly independent). So, $\\phi(kv)=kv$ and $\\phi(kw)=kw$. This means\n$f(v)=av$ and $f(w)=bw$, where $a,b\\in k$. Since $k(v+w)$ is also a\npoint in $\\Pi$, $\\phi(k(v+w))=k(v+w)$ and so $f(v+w)=c(v+w)$. By of $f$,\n$a=c=b$. Next, for an arbitrary non-zero element $d\\in k$, $k(dv+w)$ is\na point in $\\Pi$ and hence fixed by $\\phi$. Translating this to $f$, we\nhave $f(dv+w)=r(dv+w)$. By semi-linearity of $f$, we get\n$rdv+rw=d^{\\alpha}f(v)+f(w)=d^{\\alpha}cv+cw$. So $rd=d^{\\alpha}c$ and\n$r=c$. Solving this we get $cd=d^{\\alpha}c$ or $d^{\\alpha}=cdc^{-1}$.\nThis shows that $\\alpha$ is an inner-automorphism of $k$. But $k$ is a\nfield, $\\alpha$ is the identity on $k$. As a result, $f$ is a linear\ntransformation.\n\nIn other words, every perspectivity is a collineation if the dimension\nof $V$ is at least 3 (in particular, $PG(V)$ is at least a projective\nplane).\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In the literature, the maps $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ (see Background\n    above) are also known as perspectivies. To make a distinction\n    between this and the formal definition given earlier, we will call,\n    say $\\rho$, a perspectivity *between two projective figures*\n    $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ with *center* $P$. A *projective figure* is\n    just a collection of points (one-dimensional subspaces) in a\n    projective geometry. In this way, we can define a *projectivity\n    between two projective figures $X$ and $Y$* as a bijection\n    $\\rho:X\\to Y$ such that there exists a point $P$ with the property\n    that\n\n    *for any $x\\in X$, points $P,x,$ and $\\rho(x)$ are collinear.*\n\n    Two projective figures are perspective if there is a perspectivity\n    between them.\n\n-   In a projective geometry, every pair of points are perpective.\n\n-   If $V$ is finite dimensional, then every collineation is a product\n    of a finite number of perspectivities. The number of perspectivities\n    required is at most $\\operatorname{dim}(V)$. In particular, the\n    picture becomes apparant when the collineation can be diagonalized.\n    For if a collineation $p$ can be represented by a diagonal matrix\n    whose diagonal entries are $d_1,\\ldots, d_n$ from the top left to\n    the bottom right, then\n\n    $\\begin{pmatrix}\n    d_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & d_2 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cdots & d_n\n    \\end{pmatrix}$= $\\begin{pmatrix}\n    d_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & d_2 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\cdots\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & \\cdots & d_n\n    \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    where each of the matrices on the right represents a perspectivity.\n    This is only an idealized situation where the linear transformation\n    can be diagonalized. There are perspectivities that induce\n    non-diagonalizable linear transformations; see central collineations\n    for detail.\n\n-   **(Second Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry)**. From the\n    two assertions above, one can show that\n\n    > if $\\operatorname{dim}(V)=n < \\infty$, and if\n    > $\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\n    > \\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace w_1,\\ldots, w_n\\rbrace$ are two sets of\n    > points in general position, then there is a unique projectivity\n    > $p$ such that $p(v_i)=w_i$.\n\n-   Since a projective geometry is a bounded lattice, the concept of two\n    points being perspective with one another can be generalized to\n    elements found in a bounded lattice: two elements $a,b$ in a bounded\n    lattice $L$ are in perspective if they have a common complement $c$,\n    that is, $a\\vee c=b\\vee c=1$ and $a\\wedge c=b\\wedge c=0$. If we\n    apply this back to the case when $L$ is a projective geometry, we\n    see that $a$ and $b$ are in perspective precisely when there is a\n    perspectivity taking $a$ to $b$. If $a\\ne b$, then $c$ is the\n    hyperplane that is fixed by the perspectivity.",
