  "definition": "Definition\n==========\n\nIn an ordered geometry $S$, given a point $p$ let $\\Pi(p)$ be the family\nof all rays emanating from it. Let $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Pi(p)$ such that\n$\\alpha\\neq\\beta$ and $\\alpha\\neq-\\beta$. The *angle* $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ at $p$ is $$\\lbrace \\rho\\in\\Pi(p)\\mid\n\\rho\\mbox{ is between }\\alpha\\mbox{ and }\\beta\\rbrace.$$ This angle is\ndenoted by $\\angle \\alpha p\\beta$. The two rays $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are\nthe *sides* of the angle, and $p$ the *vertex* of the angle. Since any\npoint (other than the source $p$) on a ray uniquely determines the ray,\nwe may also write the angle by $\\angle apb$, whenever we have points\n$a\\in\\alpha$ and $b\\in\\beta$.\n\nThe notational device given for the angle suggests the possibility of\ndefining an angle between two line segments satisfying certain\nconditions: let $\\overline{pq}$ and $\\overline{qr}$ be two open line\nsegments with a common endpoint $q$. The angle between the two open line\nsegments is the angle between the rays ${\\overrightarrow{qp}}$ and\n${\\overrightarrow{qr}}$. In this case, we may denote the angle by\n$\\angle pqr$.\n\nSuppose $\\ell$ is a line and $p$ a point lying on $\\ell$. We have two\nopposite rays emanating from $p$ that lie on $\\ell$. Call them $\\sigma$\nand $-\\sigma$. Any ray $\\rho$ emanating from a point $p$ that does not\nlie on $\\ell$ produces two angles at $p$, one between $\\rho$ and\n$\\sigma$ and the other between $\\rho$ and $-\\sigma$. These two angles\nare said to be *supplement* of one another, or that\n$\\angle \\sigma p \\rho$ is *supplementary* of $\\angle\n(-\\sigma) p \\rho$. Every angle has exactly two supplements.\n\nOrdering of Angles\n==================\n\nLet $S$ be an ordered geometry and $\\rho$ a ray in $S$ with source point\n$p$. Consider the set $E$ of all angles whose one side is $\\rho$. Define\nan ordering on $E$ by the following rule: for\n$\\angle \\alpha p\\rho,\\angle \\beta p\\rho\\in E$,\n\n1.  $\\angle\\alpha p\\rho=\\angle\\beta p\\rho$ if $\\alpha=\\beta$,\n\n2.  $\\angle\\alpha p\\rho<\\angle\\beta p\\rho$ if\n    $\\alpha\\in\\angle\\beta p\\rho$, and\n\n3.  $\\angle\\alpha p\\rho>\\angle\\beta p\\rho$ if\n    $\\beta\\in\\angle\\alpha p\\rho$.\n\nThe ordering relation above is well-defined. However, it is quite\nlimited, because there is no way to compare angles if the pair (of\nangles) do not share a common side. This can be remedied with an\nadditional set of axioms on the geometry: the axioms of congruence.\\\n\\\nIn an ordered geometry satisfying the congruence axioms, we have the\nconcept of angle congruence. This binary relation turns out to be an\nequivalence relation, so we can form the set of equivalence classes on\nangles. Each equivalence class of angles is called a *free angle*. Any\nmember of a free angle $\\mathfrak{a}$ is called a representative of\n$\\mathfrak{a}$, which is simply an angle of form $\\angle abc$, where $b$\nis the source of two rays ${\\overrightarrow{ba}}$ and\n${\\overrightarrow{bc}}$. We write $\\mathfrak{a}=[\\angle abc]$. It is\neasy to see that given a point $p$ and a ray $\\rho$ emanating from $p$,\nwe can find, in each free angle, a representative whose one side is\n$\\rho$. In other words, for any free angle $\\mathfrak{a}$, it is\npossible to write $\\mathfrak{a}=[\\angle \\alpha p\\rho]$ for some ray\n$\\alpha$.\\\n\\\nNow we are ready to define orderings on angles in general. In fact, this\nthis done via free angles. Let $\\mathfrak{A}$ be the set of all free\nangles in an ordered geometry satisfying the congruence axioms, and\n$\\mathfrak{a},\\mathfrak{b}\\in\\mathfrak{A}$. Write\n$\\mathfrak{a}=[\\angle \\alpha p\\rho]$ and $\\mathfrak{b}=[\\angle \\beta\np\\rho]$. We say that $\\mathfrak{a}<\\mathfrak{b}$ if ray $\\alpha$ is\nbetween $\\beta$ and $\\rho$. The other inequality is dually defined. This\nis a well-defined binary relation. Given the ordering on free angles, we\ndefine $\\angle \\alpha p\\beta<\\angle \\gamma q\\delta$ if\n$[\\angle \\alpha p\\beta]<[\\angle \\gamma q\\delta]$.\\\n\\\nLet $\\ell$ be a line and $p$ a point lying on $\\ell$. The point $p$\ndetermines two opposite rays $\\rho$ and $-\\rho$ lying on $\\ell$. Any ray\n$\\sigma$ emanating from $p$ that is distinct from either $\\rho$ and\n$-\\rho$ determines exactly two angles: $\\angle \\rho p\\sigma$ and\n$\\angle (-\\rho)p\\sigma$. These two angles are said to be supplements of\none another, or that one is supplementary of the other.\\\n\\\nIn an ordered geometry satisfying the congruence axioms, supplementary\nfree angles are defined if each contains a representative that is\nsupplementary to one another. Given two supplementary free angles\n$\\mathfrak{a},\\mathfrak{b}$, we may make comparisons of the two:\n\n-   if $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{b}$, then we say that $\\mathfrak{a}$ is a\n    *right free angle*, or simple a *right angle*. Clearly\n    $\\mathfrak{b}$ is a right angle if $\\mathfrak{a}$ is;\n\n-   if $\\mathfrak{a}>\\mathfrak{b}$, then $\\mathfrak{a}$ is called an\n    *obtuse free angle*, or an *obtuse angle*. The supplement of an\n    obtuse angle is called an *acute free angle*, or an *acute angle*.\n    Thus, $\\mathfrak{b}$ is acute if $\\mathfrak{a}$ is obtuse.\n\nGiven any two free angles, we can always compare them. In other words,\nthe law of trichotomy is satisfied by the ordering of free angles: for\nany $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$, exactly one of\n$$\\mathfrak{a}>\\mathfrak{b}\\qquad\\qquad\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{b}\n\\qquad\\qquad\\mathfrak{a}<\\mathfrak{b}$$ is true.\n\nOperations on Angles\n====================\n\nLet $S$ be an ordered geometry satisfying the congruence axioms and\n$\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$ are two free angles. Write\n$\\mathfrak{a}=[\\angle\\alpha p\\beta]$ and $\\mathfrak{b}=[\\angle\\beta\np\\gamma]$. If $\\beta$ is between $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$, we define an\n\u201caddition\u201d of $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}$, written\n$\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}$ as the free angle $\\mathfrak{c}$ with\nrepresentative $\\angle\\alpha p\\gamma$. In symbol, this says that if\n$\\beta$ is between $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$, then $$[\\angle \\alpha\np\\beta]+[\\angle \\beta p\\gamma]=[\\angle \\alpha p\\gamma].$$ This is a\nwell-defined binary operation, provided that *one free angle is between\nthe other two*. Therefore, the sum of a pair of supplementary angles is\nnot defined! In addition, if $\\mathfrak{a}$ and $\\mathfrak{c}$ are two\nfree angles, such that there exists a free angle $\\mathfrak{b}$ with\n$\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}=\\mathfrak{c}$, then $\\mathfrak{b}$ is unique\nand we denote it by $\\mathfrak{c}-\\mathfrak{a}$. It is also possible to\ndefine the multiplication of a free angle by a positive integer,\nprovided that the resulting angle is a well-defined free angle. Finally,\ndivision of a free angle by positive integral powers of 2 can also be\ndefined.\n\nAngle Measurement\n=================\n\nAn angle measure $\\mathcal{A}$ is a function defined on free angles of\nan ordered geometry $S$ with the congruence axioms, such that\n\n1.  $\\mathcal{A}$ is real-valued and positive,\n\n2.  $\\mathcal{A}$ is additive; in other words,\n    $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b})=\n    \\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})+\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{b})$, if\n    $\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}$ is defined;\n\nHere are some properties:\n\n-   if $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})=\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{b})$, then\n    $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{b}$.\n\n-   $\\mathfrak{a}>\\mathfrak{b}$ iff $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})>\n    \\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{b})$.\n\n-   for any free angle $\\mathfrak{a}$, denote its supplement by\n    $\\mathfrak{a}^s$. Then $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})+\n    \\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a}^s)$ is a positive constant\n    $r_{\\mathcal{A}}$ that does not depend on $\\mathfrak{a}$.\n\n-   $\\mathcal{A}$ is bounded above by $r_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\n-   if $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are angle measures, then\n    $\\mathcal{A+B}$ defined by $(\\mathcal{A+B})(\\mathfrak{a})=\n    \\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})+\\mathcal{B}(\\mathfrak{a})$ is an angle\n    measure too.\n\n-   if $\\mathcal{A}$ is an angle measure, then for any positive real\n    number $r$, $r\\mathcal{A}$ defined by\n    $(r\\mathcal{A})(\\mathfrak{a})=r(\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a}))$ is also\n    an angle measure. In the event that $r$ is an integer such that\n    $r\\mathfrak{a}$ makes sense, we also have\n    $r(\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a}))=\\mathcal{A}(r\\mathfrak{a})$.\n\nIf $S$ is a neutral geometry, then we impose a third requirement for a\nfunction to be an angle measure:\n\n1.  for any real number $r$ with $0<r<r_{\\mathcal{A}}$, there is a free\n    angle $\\mathfrak{a}$ such that $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathfrak{a})=r$.\n\nOnce the measure of a free angle is defined, one can next define the\nmeasure of an angle: let $\\mathcal{A}$ be a measure of the free angles,\ndefine $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}$ on angles by\n$\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}(\\angle \\alpha p\\beta)=\\mathcal{A}([\\angle\n\\alpha p\\beta])$. This is a well-defined function. It is easy to see\nthat $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}(\\angle \\alpha p\\beta)=\n\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}(\\angle \\gamma q\\delta)$ iff $\\angle \\alpha\np\\beta\\cong\\angle \\gamma q\\delta$, and $\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}(\\angle\n\\alpha p\\beta)>\\mathcal{A}^{\\prime}(\\angle \\gamma q\\delta)$ iff\n$\\angle \\alpha p\\beta>\\angle \\gamma q\\delta$.\\\n\\\nTwo popular angle measures are the degree measure and the radian\nmeasure. In the degree measure, $r_\\mathcal{A}=180^{\\circ}$. In the\nradian measure, $r_\\mathcal{A}=\\pi$.\n\n[6]{} D. Hilbert, [*Foundations of Geometry*]{}, Open Court Publishing\nCo. (1971) K.
