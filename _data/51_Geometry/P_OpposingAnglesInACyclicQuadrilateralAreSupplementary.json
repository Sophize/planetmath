Now, since a circumferential angle is half the corresponding\ncentral angle, we see that $\\angle BAD + \\angle BCD$ is one half of the\nsum of the two angles $BOD$ at $O$. But the sum of these two angles is\n$360^{\\circ}$, so that $$\\angle BAD + \\angle BCD = 180^{\\circ}$$\nSimilarly, the sum of the other two opposing angles is also\n$180^{\\circ}$.",
