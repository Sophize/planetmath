  "statement": "[(Pasch)]{} Let $\\triangle abc$ be a triangle with non-collinear\nvertices $a,b,c$ in a [linear]{} ordered geometry. Suppose a line $\\ell$\nintersects one side, say open line segment $\\overline{ab}$, at a point\nstrictly between $a$ and $b$, then $\\ell$ also intersects exactly one of\nthe following:\n$$\\overline{bc}\\mbox{, }\\qquad\\qquad\\overline{ac}\\mbox{, }\\qquad\\qquad c.$$\n\nFirst, note that vertices $a$ and $b$ are on opposite sides of line\n$\\ell$. Then either $c$ lies on $\\ell$, or $c$ does not. if $c$ does\nnot, then it must lie on either side (half plane) of $\\ell$. In other\nwords, $c$ and $a$ must be on the opposite sides of $\\ell$, or $c$ and\n$b$ must be on the opposite sides of $\\ell$. If $c$ and $a$ are on the\nopposite sides, $\\ell$ has a non-empty intersection with\n$\\overline{ac}$. But if $c$ and $a$ are on the opposite sides, then $c$\nand $b$ are on the same side, which means that $\\overline{bc}$ does not\nintersect $\\ell$.\n\n**Remark** A companion property states that if line $\\ell$ passes\nthrough one vertex $a$ of a triangle $\\triangle abc$ and at least one\nother point on $\\triangle abc$, then it must intersect exactly one of\nthe following:\n$$b\\mbox{, }\\qquad\\qquad c\\mbox{, }\\qquad\\qquad\\overline{bc}.$$ Of\ncourse, if $\\ell$ passes through $b$, $\\overline{ab}$ must lie on\n$\\ell$. Similarly, $\\overline{ac}$ lies on $\\ell$ if $\\ell$ passes\nthrough $c$.",
