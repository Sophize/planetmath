  "definition": "The *incenter* of a geometrical shape is the center of the incircle (if\nit has any). The radius of the incircle is sometimes called the\n*inradius*.\n\nOn a triangle the incenter always exists and it is the intersection\npoint of the three internal angle bisectors. So in the next picture,\n$AX,BY,CZ$ are angle bisectors, and $AB,BC,CA$ are tangent to the\ncircle.\n\n![image](incentre)",
