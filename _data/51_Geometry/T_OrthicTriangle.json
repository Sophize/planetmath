  "definition": "If $ABC$ is a triangle and $AD, DE, CF$ are its three , then the\ntriangle $DEF$ is called the *orthic triangle* of $ABC$.\n\nA remarkable property of orthic triangles says that the orthocenter of\n$ABC$ is also the incenter of the orthic triangle $DEF$. That is, the\nheights of $ABC$ are the angle bisectors of $DEF$.\n\n![image](ortho)",
