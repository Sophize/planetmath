Thus if a collineation fixes more than a hyperplane of\npoints then it in fact fixes all the points of the geometry and so it is\nthe identity map. Therefore a central collineation can be viewed the\nsimplest of the non-identity collineations.\n\nEvery collineation of a finite dimensional projective geometry of\ndimension $n>1$ is a product of at most $n$ central collineations. In\nparticular, the automorphism group of a projective geometry of dimension\n$n>1$ is generated by central collineations.\n\nSuppose that a central collineation is not the identity. Then the\nhyperplane of fixed points is unique and receives the title of *the axis\nof the central collineation*. There is one further important result\nwhich justifies the name \u201ccentral\u201d.\n\n\\[prop:center\\] Given a non-identity central collineation $f$, there is\na unique point $C$ such that for all other points $P$, it follows that\n$C$, $P$ and $Pf$ are collinear.\n\nThe point $C$ determined by Proposition \\[prop:center\\] is called the\n*center* of the non-identity central collineation. It is possible for\nthe center to lie on the axis.\n\nCentral collineations in coordinates {#central-collineations-in-coordinates .unnumbered}\n====================================\n\nSuppose we have a projective geometry of dimension $n>2$, that is, we\nexclude now the case of projective lines and planes. The the geometry\ncan be coordinatized through so that we may regard the projective\ngeometry as the lattice of subspaces of a vector space $V$ of dimension\n$n+1$ over a division ring $\\Delta$. Following the fundamental theorem\nof projective geometry we further know that every collineation is\ninduced by a semi-linear transformation of $V$. So it is possible to\nexplore central collineations as semi-linear transformations.\n\nEvery hyperplane is a kernel of some linear functional, so we let\n$\\varphi:V\\to \\Delta$ be a linear functional of $V$ with $H\\varphi=0$.\nFurthermore, we fix $v\\in V$ so that $v\\varphi=1$ (which implieas also\nthat $v\\notin H$). Hence, for each $u\\in V$,\n$u=(u-(u\\varphi)v)+(u\\varphi)v$ where $u-(u\\varphi) v\\in H$ and\n$(u\\varphi)v\\in\\langle v\\rangle$.\n\nLet $f\\in \\operatorname{GL}_{\\Delta}(V)$ such that $f$ induces a central\ncollineation $\\tilde{f}$ on $PG(V)$ with axis $H\\leq V$. As every scalar\nmultiple of $f$ induces the same collineation of $PG(V)$, we may assume\nthat $f$ is the identity on $H$. Using the decomposition given by\n$\\varphi$ we have\n$$uf = ((u-(u\\varphi)v)+(u\\varphi)v)f = (u-(u\\varphi)v) + (u\\varphi) vf,\\qquad u\\in V.$$\nHence $$uf = u + (u\\varphi)\\hat{v},\\qquad \\hat{v}:=vf-v.$$\n\nSuppose instead that $\\varphi$ is any linear functional of $V$. Then\nselect some $\\hat{v}\\in V$ such that $\\hat{v}\\varphi\\neq -1$. Then\n$$ug := u+(u\\varphi)\\hat{v}$$ fixes all the points of $\\ker \\varphi$ so\n$g$ induces a central collineation.\n\nIf we wish to do the same without appealing to linear functionals, we\nmay select a basis $\\{v_1,\\dots, v_{n+1}\\}$ such that\n$H=\\langle v_1,\\dots, v_n\\rangle$ and $v_{n+1}\\varphi=1$. As $f$ is\nselected to be the identity on $H$ we have so far specified $f$ by the\nmatrix: $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\ddots & & \\\\\n0 & & 1 & \\\\\na_1 & a_2 &\\cdots  & a_{n+1}\n\\end{bmatrix}$$ in the basis $\\{v_1,\\dots, v_n,v_{n+1}\\}$.",
