  "definition": "Let $ABC$ a right triangle in a Euclidean geometry with right angle at\n$C$. Then $AB$ is called the *hypotenuse* of $ABC$.\n\n![image](hyp)\n\nThe midpoint $P$ of the hypotenuse coincides with the circumcenter of\nthe triangle, so it is equidistant from the three vertices. When the\ntriangle is inscribed on his circumcircle, the hypotenuse becomes a\ndiameter. So the distance from $P$ to the vertices is precisely the\ncircumradius.\n\nThe hypotenuse\u2019s length can be calculated by means of the Pythagorean\ntheorem: $$c=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$",
