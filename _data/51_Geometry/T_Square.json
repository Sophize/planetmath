  "definition": "A *square* is the regular 4-gon, that is, a quadrilateral whose 4 angles\nand 4 sides are respectively equal. Each angle of a square must be a\nright angle. This implies a square is a parallelogram that is both a\nrhombus and a rectangle at the same time.\n\nNotice, however, that if a quadrilateral has its 4 sides equal, we\ncannot generally say it is a square, since it might be a rhombus as\nwell.\n\nIf $r$ is the length of a side, the diagonals of a square (which are\nequal since it\u2019s a rectangle too) have length $r\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n![image](square)",
