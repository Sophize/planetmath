An\n*affine space associated with $V$* is a set $A$, together with a\nfunction $f: A\\times A\\to V$, with the following conditions:\n\n1.  for every $P\\in A$, the function $f(P,-):A\\to V$ is onto.\n\n2.  $f$ is non-degenerate in the sense that $f(P,Q)=0$ implies $P=Q$.\n\n3.  $f(P,Q)+f(Q,R)=f(P,R)$.\n\nAn *affine space* is an affine space associated with some vector space.\nElements of $A$ are called *points* of $A$. The *dimension* of an affine\nspace is just the dimension of its associated vector space. The function\n$f$ is called a *direction*. We sometimes write\n$\\stackrel{\\longrightarrow}{PQ}$ for $f(P,Q)$.\n\nFor example, $V$ itself is an affine space associated with $V$, with $f$\ngiven by $f(v,w)=w-v$.\n\nBelow are some properties of $f$:\n\n1.  $f(P,P)=0$, because $f(P,P)+f(P,P)=f(P,P)$ by condition 3, hence the\n    result.\n\n2.  $f(P,-)$ is one-to-one, and therefore a bijection, for if\n    $f(P,Q)=f(P,R)$, then $f(P,Q)+f(Q,R)=f(P,R)=f(P,Q)$, so $f(Q,R)=0$,\n    or $Q=R$, by condition 2.\n\n3.  $f(P,Q)=-f(Q,P)$, because $f(P,Q)+f(Q,P)=f(P,P)=0$.\n\n4.  $f(-,Q)$ is also a bijection as a result.\n\nVector Spaces Induced by an Affine Space {#vector-spaces-induced-by-an-affine-space .unnumbered}\n----------------------------------------\n\nAn affine space is often called a \u201cvector space without the origin\u201d. In\nother words, singling out a point in an affine space gives us a vector\nspace, in the following sense: fix a point $P$ in an affine space $A$,\ndefine a vector space $A_P$ as follows:\n\n1.  vectors of $A_P$ are points of $A$,\n\n2.  define $+_P:A_P\\times A_P \\to A_P$ by $Q +_P R:=S$, where $S$ is the\n    point determined by $f(P,Q)+f(P,R)=f(P,S)$. Because of property 2\n    above, $S$ is uniquely determined.\n\n3.  define $\\cdot_P: D\\times A_P \\to A_P$ by $d \\cdot_P Q:=T$, where $T$\n    is the point determined by $df(P,Q)=f(P,T)$. Again, $T$ is unique.\n\nBoth $+_P$ and $\\cdot_P$ are well-defined, because $f(P,-)$ is a\nbijection. When there is no confusion, we may drop the subscript $P$. It\nis also easy to verify that $A_P$, together with $+$ and $\\cdot$, is\nindeed a left vector space over $D$, with $P$ as the origin, written\n$0_P$. Furthermore, $A_P$ is isomorphic to $V$. Hence, $A_P\\cong A_Q$\nfor any two points $P,Q\\in A$; there is nothing special about $P$, and\nany point of $A$ can be used as the origin of a vector space.\n\nAffine Subspaces {#affine-subspaces .unnumbered}\n----------------\n\nContinue to assume that $V$ is a left vector space over a division ring\n$D$, and $(A,f)$ an affine space associated with $V$. An *affine\nsubspace* of $A$ is the collection $B$ of points of $A$ that is mapped\nto a vector subspace $S$ of $V$ by the induced function $f(P,-)$ for\nsome point $P\\in A$. In other words, $B$ is the inverse image of $S$\nunder the function $f(P,-)$:\n$$B = \\lbrace Q \\in A\\mid f(P,Q)\\in S\\rbrace.$$ If $f$ is restricted to\n$B\\times B$, then $B$ is an affine space associated with $W$, since\n$f(Q,R)=f(P,R)-f(P,Q)\\in W$, given that $Q,R\\in B$.\n\nFor example, if $V$ is considered as an affine space associated with $V$\nwith the map $f(v,w)=w-v$, then an affine subspace $B$ of $V$ is just a\ncoset of a subspace of $V$. In other words, $B=S+v$, where $S$ is a\nsubspace of $V$ and $v\\in V$ is a vector. It is evident that $B$ is\nuniquely determined by $S$, and $v$ up to translation by a vector in\n$S$. In other words, any two cosets of $S$ are affinely isomorphic.\n\nIn an affine space $A$, an *affine point*, *affine line*, or *affine\nplane* is a $0,1$, or $2$ dimensional affine subspace. Thus, an affine\npoint is just the inverse image of the origin $0\\in V$. The codimension\nof an affine subspace is the codimension of the associated vector\nsubspace. An *affine hyperplane* is an affine subspace with codimension\n1. When there is no confusion, we may drop the word \u201caffine\u201d in affine\npoint, affine line, etc... Affine subspaces are also called *flats*.\n\nAffine Geometry {#affine-geometry .unnumbered}\n---------------\n\nAffine geometry is, generally speaking, the study the geometric\nproperties of affine subspaces. In particular, it is the study of the\nincidence structure on affine subspaces. Operationally, we may define an\n*affine geometry* $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ of a vector space $V$ to be the poset\nof all affine subspaces of $V$, orderd by set theoretic inclusion.\nPoints in $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ are commonly written without the set\ntheoretic brackets, so that $v\\in\\mathcal{A}(V)$ means\n$\\lbrace v\\rbrace \\in\\mathcal{A}(V)$.\n\nNext, we can define an incidence relation $I$ on $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ so\nthat $(A,B)\\in I$ iff $A\\subseteq B$ or $B\\subseteq A$. Together with\n$I$, $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ becomes an incidence geometry. Two flats $A$ and\n$B$ are said to be *parallel* if they have the same associated subspace.\nAs a result, two parallel flats are never incident unless they are\nequal. Also, given a point $v\\in \\mathcal{A}(V)$ not incident with $A$,\nwe can always find a flat $B$ incident with $v$ and parallel to $A$. If\n$A=S+w$ with $w\\neq v$, simply take $B=S+v$. This makes $\\mathcal{A}(V)$\nan affine incidence geometry.\n\nIn addition, we define $A\\vee B$ to be the smallest flat in\n$\\mathcal{A}(V)$ that contains both $A$ and $B$. By Zorn\u2019s lemma,\n$A\\vee B$ exists. Since $A\\vee B$ is also unique, $\\vee$ is\nwell-defined. This turns $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ into an upper semilattice. If\n$S_1$ is the associated subspace of $A$ and $S_2$ is the associated\nsubspace of $B$, then $\\operatorname{span}(S_1\\cup S_2)$ is the\nassociated subspace of $A\\vee B$. The definition of $\\vee$ can be\nextended to an arbitrary set of flats, so that $\\bigvee \\mathcal{S}$ is\nthe smallest flat that contains all flats in\n$\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}$. In fact, it is not hard to see that\n$\\mathcal{A}(V)$ is complete semilattice.\n\nHowever, since $A\\cap B$ may be empty, $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ is not a lattice\nin general via the \u201cmeet\u201d ($=\\cap$) operation. But when\n$A\\cap B\\neq \\varnothing$, $A\\cap B\\in \\mathcal{A}(V)$. So $\\cap$ is a\npartially defined operator on $\\mathcal{A}(V)$. If one adjoins the empty\nset $\\varnothing$ to $\\mathcal{A}(V)$, then $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ becomes a\nlattice. $\\varnothing$ is called the null subspace and its dimension is\ndefined to be $-1$. One can show that $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ is a geometric\nlattice.\n\nAlthough $0\\in \\mathcal{A}(V)$, it is not special, since all points are\ntreated equally; there is no notion of an origin in $\\mathcal{A}(V)$.\nThe notion of a metric is also absent, since the underlying vector space\nis not assumed to have an inner product. In fact, perpendicularity is\nnot defined in $\\mathcal{A}(V)$. In contrast, both notions are important\nin Euclidean geometry, where an inner product has been defined, so that\n$0$ is the unique vector with $0$ length.\n\nAffine versus Projective {#affine-versus-projective .unnumbered}\n------------------------\n\nAffine geometry and projective geometry are intimately related. Given an\naffine geometry $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ one can construct projective\ngeometries. One easy way is to identify flats that are parallel to each\nother. Because the parallel relation $\\parallel$ is an equivalence\nrelation, we can partition $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ into equivalence classes.\nSince each equivalence class is represented by exactly one subspace $S$\nof $V$, so $\\mathcal{A}(V)/\\parallel$ can be identified with $PG(V)$. Of\ncourse, $PG(V)$ can also be viewed as a sub-poset of $\\mathcal{A}(V)$\n(simply by taking all the subspaces of $V$ in $\\mathcal{A}(V)$). More\ngenerally, if we fix any point $v\\in \\mathcal{A}(V)$, and take all flats\nthat are incident with $v$, the resulting subset $PG_v(V)$ forms a\nmodular complemented geometric lattice that is isomorphic to $PG(V)$. In\nfact, $PG_v(V)$ has the structure of a projective geometry.\n\nAnother way to construct a projective geometry from an affine one is to\nadjoin extra elements to $\\mathcal{A}(V)$. Remember that\n$\\mathcal{A}(V)$ itself is not a lattice, but simply adjoining\n$\\varnothing$ to $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ won\u2019t give us a projective geometry\neither, because the resulting lattice is not modular (take two parallel\nlines $\\ell_1,\\ell_2$ and a point $P$ lying on $\\ell_1$; then\n$P\\vee (\\ell_2\\wedge \\ell_1)=P$, while\n$(P\\vee\\ell_2)\\wedge \\ell_1=\\ell_1$). We start by taking a vector space\n$U$ such that $V$ is a subspace of $U$ of codimension 1 (This can be\ndone by linear algebra). Our objective is to show that $\\mathcal{A}(V)$\nis embeddable in $PG(U)$.\n\nLet $u\\in U$ be a non-zero vector and look at the affine hyperplane\n$V+u$. Each affine subspace of the form $S+v$ in $V$ has the form\n$S+v+u$ in $V+u$, where $S$ is a subspace of $V$ and $v\\in V$. Let\n$\\mathcal{A}_u(V)$ the collection of all affine subspaces $S+v+u$\n(affine subspaces of $U$ that are incident with $V+u$). There is an\nobvious one-to-one order preserving correspondence between\n$\\mathcal{A}(V)$ and $\\mathcal{A}_u(V)$.\n\nNext, every affine subspace $S+v+u$ is the intersection of $V+u$ and a\nsubspace $W$ of $U$ such that $S+v+u\\subseteq W$ and\n$\\operatorname{dim}(W)= \\operatorname{S}+1$. Just take\n$W=\\operatorname{span}(S,v+u)$. Clearly $S+v+u\\subseteq W\\cap V+u$. In\naddition, $v+u\\notin S\\subseteq V$, or else $u\\in V$ gives us a\ncontradiction. So $\\operatorname{dim}(W)= \\operatorname{S}+1$. Finally,\nif $x\\in V+u\\cap W$, then $x=y+u=s+k(v+u)$, where $y\\in V$, $s\\in S$,\nand $k\\in D$. So $x\\equiv u\\equiv ku \\pmod V$. This implies\n$(1-k)u\\in V$. But $u\\notin V$, $k=1$. Therefore $x=s+u+v\\in S+v+u$.\nThis means that $W\\cap V+u=S+v+u$.\n\nThe above paragraph shows there is a one-to-one order preserving map\nfrom $\\mathcal{A}(V)$ to $PG(U)$. If we delete all subspaces of $V$ from\n$PG(U)$, and call\n$$PG(U)/PG(V)=\\lbrace W\\in PG(U)\\mid W\\mbox{ is not a subspace of }V\\rbrace,$$\nthen we actually get an order-preserving bijection between\n$\\mathcal{A}(V)$ and $PG(U)/PG(V)$.",
