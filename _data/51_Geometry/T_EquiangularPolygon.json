  "definition": "A polygon is *equiangular* if all of its interior angles are congruent.\n\nCommon examples of equiangular polygons are rectangles and regular\npolygons such as equilateral triangles and squares.\n\nLet $T$ be a triangle in Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry, or\nspherical geometry. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n-   $T$ is equilateral;\n\n-   $T$ is equiangular;\n\n-   $T$ is regular.\n\nIf $T$ is allowed to be a polygon that has more than three sides, then\nthe above statement is no longer true in any of the indicated\ngeometries.\n\nBelow are some pictures of equiangular polygons drawn in Euclidean\ngeometry that are not equilateral.\n\n(0,0)(14,5) (0,0)(5,0)(5,3)(0,3)\n(8,4.527)(6,3.0743)(7,0)(9,0)(10,3.0743)\n(11,1.732)(12,0)(13,0)(14,1.732)(13,3.464)(12,3.464)",
