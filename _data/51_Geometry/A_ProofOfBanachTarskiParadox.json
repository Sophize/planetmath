  "argumentText": "We deal with some technicalities first, mainly concerning the properties\nof equi-decomposability. We can then prove the paradox in a clear and\nunencumbered line of argument: we show that, given two unit balls $U$\nand $U'$ with arbitrary origin, $U$ and $U\\cup U'$ are\nequi-decomposable, regardless whether $U$ and $U'$ are disjoint or not.\nThe original proof can be found in\u00a0[@BT].\n\nTechnicalities {#technicalities .unnumbered}\n--------------\n\n\\[theo3\\] Equi-decomposability gives rise to an equivalence relation on\nthe subsets of Euclidean space.\n\nThe only non-obvious part is transitivity. So let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets\nsuch that $A$ and $B$ as well as $B$ and $C$ are equi-decomposable. Then\nthere exist disjoint decompositions $A_1,\\ldots A_n$ of $A$ and\n$B_1,\\ldots B_n$ of $B$ such that $A_k$ and $B_k$ are congruent for\n$1\\leq k\\leq n$. Furthermore, there exist disjoint decompositions\n$B_1',\\ldots,B_m'$ of $B$ and $C_1,\\ldots C_m$ of $C$ such that $B_l'$\nand $C_l$ are congruent for $1\\leq l\\leq\nm$. Define\n$$B_{k,l}:=B_k\\cap B_l'\\text{ for }1\\leq k\\leq n, 1\\leq l\\leq m.$$ Now\nif $A_k$ and $B_k$ are congruent via some isometry $\\theta\\colon\nA_k\\to B_k$, we obtain a disjoint decomposition of $A_k$ by setting\n$A_{k,l}:=\\theta^{-1}(B_{k,l})$. Likewise, if $B_l'$ and $C_l$ are\ncongruent via some isometry $\\theta'\\colon B_l'\\to C_l$, we obtain a\ndisjoint decomposition of $C_l$ by setting $C_{k,l}:=\\theta'(B_{k,l})$.\nClearly, the $A_{k,l}$ and $C_{k,l}$ define a disjoint decomposition of\n$A$ and $C$, respectively, into $nm$ parts. By transitivity of\ncongruence, $A_{k,l}$ and $C_{k,l}$ are congruent for $1\\leq k\\leq n$\nand $1\\leq l\\leq m$. Therefore, $A$ and $C$ are equi-decomposable.\n\n\\[theo4\\] Given disjoint sets $A_1,,\\ldots A_n$, $B_1,\\ldots B_n$ such\nthat $A_k$ and $B_k$ are equi-decomposable for $1\\leq k\\leq n$, their\nunions $A={\\bigcup\\limits}_{k=1}^nA_k$ and\n$B={\\bigcup\\limits}_{k=1}^nB_k$ are equi-decomposable as well.\n\nBy definition, there exists for every $k$, $1\\leq k\\leq n$ an integer\n$l_k$ such that there are disjoint decompositions\n$$A_k={\\bigcup\\limits}_{i=1}^{l_k}A_{k,i},\\qquad B_k={\\bigcup\\limits}_{i=1}^{l_k}B_{k,i}$$\nsuch that $A_{k,i}$ and $B_{k,i}$ are congruent for $1\\leq i\\leq\nl_k$. Rewriting $A$ and $B$ in the form\n$$A={\\bigcup\\limits}_{k=1}^n{\\bigcup\\limits}_{i=1}^{l_k}A_{k,i},\\qquad B={\\bigcup\\limits}_{k=1}^n{\\bigcup\\limits}_{i=1}^{l_k}B_{k,i}$$\ngives the result.\n\n\\[cor7\\] Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets such that $A$ and $B$ are\nequi-decomposable and $C\\subsetneq A$, then there exists $D\\subsetneq B$\nsuch that $C$ and $D$ are equi-decomposable.\n\nLet $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ and $B_1,\\ldots B_n$ be disjoint decompositions of\n$A$ and $B$, respectively, such that $A_k$ and $B_k$ are congruent via\nan isometry $\\theta_k\\colon A_k\\to B_k$ for all $1\\leq k\\leq n$. Let\n$\\theta\\colon A\\to B$ a map such that $\\theta(x)=\\theta_k(x)$ if $x\\in\nA_k$. Since the $A_k$ are disjoint, $\\theta$ is well-defined everywhere.\nFurthermore, $\\theta$ is obviously bijective. Now set $C_k:=C\\cap A_k$\nand define $D_k:=\\theta_k(C_k)$, so that $C_k$ and $D_k$ are congruent\nfor $1\\leq k\\leq n$, so the disjoint union $D:=D_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup D_n$\nand $C$ are equi-decomposable. By construction, $\\theta(C)=D$. Since $C$\nis a proper subset of $A$ and $\\theta$ is bijective, $D$ is a proper\nsubset of $B$.\n\n\\[cor9\\] Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be sets such that $A$ and $C$ are\nequi-decomposable and $A\\subseteq B\\subseteq C$. Then $B$ and $C$ are\nequi-decomposable.\n\nLet $A_1,\\ldots,A_n$ and $C_1,\\ldots C_n$ disjoint decompositions of $A$\nand $C$, respectively, such that $A_k$ and $C_k$ are congruent via an\nisometry $\\theta_k$ for $1\\leq k\\leq n$. Like in the proof of\ntheorem\u00a0\\[cor7\\], let $\\theta\\colon A\\to C$ be the well-defined,\nbijective map such that $\\theta(x)=\\theta_k(x)$ if $x\\in A_k$. Now, for\nevery $b\\in B$, let ${\\mathcal}{C}(b)$ be the intersection of all sets\n$X\\subseteq B$ satisfying\n\n-   $b\\in X$,\n\n-   for all $x\\in X$, the preimage $\\theta^{-1}(x)$ lies in $X$,\n\n-   for all $x\\in X\\cap A$, the image $\\theta(x)$ lies in $X$.\n\nLet $b_1,b_2\\in B$ such that ${\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)$ and\n${\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$ are not disjoint. Then there is a\n$b\\in{\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)\\cap{\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$ such that\n$b=\\theta^r(b_1)=\\theta^s(b_2)$ for suitable integers $s$ and $r$. Given\n$b'\\in{\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)$, we have\n$b'=\\theta^t(b_1)=\\theta^{t+s-r}(b_2)$ for a suitable integer $t$, that\nis $b'\\in{\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$, so that\n${\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)\\subseteq{\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$. The reverse inclusion\nfollows likewise, and we see that for arbitrary $b_1,b_2\\in B$ either\n${\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)={\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$ or ${\\mathcal}{C}(b_1)$ and\n${\\mathcal}{C}(b_2)$ are disjoint. Now set\n$$D:=\\{b\\in B\\mid{\\mathcal}{C}(b)\\subseteq A\\},$$ then obviously\n$D\\subseteq A$. If for $b\\in B$, ${\\mathcal}{C}(b)$ consists of the\nsequence of elements $\\ldots,\\theta^{-1}(b),b,\\theta(b),\\ldots$ which is\ninfinite in both directions, then $b\\in D$. If the sequence is infinite\nin only one direction, but the final element lies in $A$, then $b\\in D$\nas well. Let $E:=\\theta(D)$ and $F:=B\\setminus D$, then clearly\n$E\\cup F\\subseteq\nC$.\n\nNow let $c\\in C$. If $c\\notin E$, then $\\theta^{-1}(c)\\notin D$, so\n${\\mathcal}{C}(\\theta^{-1}(c))$ consists of a sequence\n$\\ldots,\\theta^{-2}(c),\\theta^{-1}(c),\\ldots$ which is infinite in only\none direction and the final element does not lie in $A$. Now\n$\\theta^{-1}(c)\\in{\\mathcal}{C}(\\theta^{-1}(c))$, but since\n$\\theta^{-1}(c)$ *does* lie in $A$, it is not the final element.\nTherefore the subsequent element $c$ lies in\n${\\mathcal}{C}(\\theta^{-1}(c))$, in particular $c\\in B$ and\n${\\mathcal}{C}(c)={\\mathcal}{C}(\\theta^{-1}(c))\\not\\subseteq A$, so\n$c\\in B\\setminus D=F$. It follows that $C=E\\cup F$, and furthermore $E$\nand $F$ are disjoint.\n\nIt now follows similarly as in the preceding proofs that $D$ and\n$E=\\theta(D)$ are equi-decomposable. By theorem\u00a0\\[theo4\\], $B=D\\cup\nF$ and $C=E\\cup F$ are equi-decomposable.\n\nThe proof {#the-proof .unnumbered}\n---------\n\nWe may assume that the unit ball $U$ is centered at the origin, that is\n$U={\\mathbb}{B}_3$, while the other unit ball $U'$ has an arbitrary\norigin. Let $S$ be the surface of $U$, that is, the unit sphere. By the\nHausdorff paradox, there exists a disjoint decomposition\n$$S=B'\\cup C'\\cup D'\\cup E'$$ such that $B'$, $C'$, $D'$ and $C'\\cup D'$\nare congruent, and $E'$ is countable. For $r>0$ and\n$A\\subseteq{\\mathbb}{R}^3$, let $rA$ be the set of all vectors of $A$\nmultiplied by $r$. Set\n$$B:={\\bigcup\\limits}_{0<r<1}rB',\\quad C:={\\bigcup\\limits}_{0<r<1}rC',\\quad D:={\\bigcup\\limits}_{0<r<1}rD',\\quad E:={\\bigcup\\limits}_{0<r<1}rE'.$$\nThese sets give a disjoint decomposition of the unit ball with the\norigin deleted, and obviously $B$, $C$, $D$ and $C\\cup D$ are congruent\n(but $E$ is of course *not* countable). Set $$A_1:=B\\cup E\\cup\\{0\\}$$\nwhere $0$ is the origin. $B$ and $C\\cup D$ are trivially\nequi-decomposable. Since $C$ and $B$ as well as $D$ and $C$ are\ncongruent, $C\\cup D$ and $B\\cup C$ are equi-decomposable. Finally, $B$\nand $C\\cup D$ as well as $C$ and $B$ are congruent, so $B\\cup C$ and\n$B\\cup C\\cup D$ are equi-decomposable. In total, $B$ and $B\\cup C\\cup\nD$ are equi-decomposable by theorem\u00a0\\[theo3\\], so $A_1$ and $U$ are\nequi-decomposable by theorem\u00a0\\[theo4\\]. Similarly, we conclude that $C$,\n$D$ and $B\\cup C\\cup D$ are equi-decomposable.\n\nSince $E'$ is only countable but there are uncountably many rotations of\n$S$, there exists a rotation $\\theta$ such that\n$\\theta(E')\\subsetneq B'\\cup C'\\cup D'$, so $F:=\\theta(E)$ is a proper\nsubset of $B\\cup C\\cup D$. Since $C$ and $B\\cup C\\cup D$ are\nequi-decomposable, there exists by theorem\u00a0\\[cor7\\] a proper subset\n$G\\subsetneq C$ such that $G$ and $F$ (and thus $E$) are\nequi-decomposable. Finally, let $p\\in C\\setminus G$ an arbitrary point\nand set $$A_2:=D\\cup G\\cup\\{p\\},$$ a disjoint union by construction.\nSince $D$ and $B\\cup C\\cup D$, $G$ and $E$ as well as $\\{0\\}$ and\n$\\{p\\}$ are equi-decomposable, $A_2$ and $U$ are equi-decomposable by\ntheorem\u00a0\\[theo4\\]. $A_1$ and $A_2$ are disjoint (but\n$A_1\\cup A_2\\neq U$!).\n\nNow $U$ and $U'$ are congruent, so $U'$ and $A_2$ are equi-decomposable\nby theorem\u00a0\\[theo3\\]. If $U$ and $U'$ are disjoint, set $H:=A_2$.\nOtherwise we may use theorem\u00a0\\[cor7\\] and choose $H\\subsetneq A_2$ such\nthat $H$ and $U'\\setminus U$ are equi-decomposable. By\ntheorem\u00a0\\[theo4\\], $A_1\\cup H$ and $U\\cup\n(U'\\setminus U)=U\\cup U'$ are equi-decomposable. Now we have\n$$A_1\\cup H\\subseteq U\\subseteq U\\cup U',$$ so by theorem\u00a0\\[cor9\\], $U$\nand $U\\cup U'$ are equi-decomposable.\n\n[BT]{}\n\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">St.\u00a0Banach, A.\u00a0Tarski</span>, Sur\nla d\u00e9composition des ensembles de points en parties respectivement\ncongruentes, *Fund.\u00a0math.*\u00a06, 244\u2013277, (1924).",
