  "statement": "Adrien-Marie Legendre has proved some theorems concerning the sum of the\nangles of triangle. Here we give one of them, being the inverse of the\ntheorem in the entry \u201csum of angles of triangle in Euclidean geometry\u201d.\n\n**Theorem.** If the sum of the interior angles of every triangle equals\nstraight angle, then the parallel postulate is true, i.e., in the plane\ndetermined by a line and a point outwards it there is exactly one line\nthrough the point which does not intersect the line.\n\n[*Proof.*]{} We consider a line $a$ and a point $B$ not belonging to\n$a$. Let $BA$ be the normal line of $a$ (with $A \\in a$) and $b$ be the\nnormal line of $BA$ through the point $B$. By the supposition of the\ntheorem, $b$ does not intersect $a$.\n\nWe will show that in the plane determined by the line $a$ and the point\n$B$, there are through $B$ no other lines than $b$ not intersecting the\nline $a$. For this purpose, we choose through $B$ a line $b'$ which\ndiffers from $b$; let the line $b'$ form with $BA$ an acute angle\n$\\beta$.\n\nWe determine on the line $a$ a point $A_1$ such that $AA_1 = AB$. By the\nsupposition of the theorem, in the isosceles right triangle $BAA_1$ we\nhave\n$$\\alpha_1 \\;\\,=:\\;\\, \\angle AA_1B \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2^2}.$$\n\nNext we determine on $a$ a second point $A_2$ such that $A_1A_2 = A_1B$.\nBy the supposition of the theorem, in the isosceles triangle $BA_1A_2$\nwe have\n$$\\alpha_2 \\;\\,=:\\;\\, \\angle AA_2B \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\alpha_1}{2} \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2^3}.$$\n\nWe continue similarly by forming isosceles triangles using the points\n$A_3$, $A_3$, $\\ldots$, $A_n$ of the line $a$ such that\n$$A_2A_3 \\,=\\;\\, BA_2,\\;\\; A_3A_4 \\,=\\;\\, BA_3,\\;\\;\\ldots,\\;\\; \nA_{n-1}A_n \\,=\\;\\, BA_{n-1}.$$\n\nThen the acute angles being formed beside the points are\n$$\\alpha_3 \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2^4},\\;\\; \n\\alpha_4 \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2^5},\\;\\; \\ldots, \\;\\;\n\\alpha_n \\;=\\;\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2^{n+1}}.$$ They form a geometric sequence\nwith the common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{2}$. When $n$ is sufficiently great,\nthe member $\\alpha_n$ is less than any given positive angle. As we have\nso much triangles $BA_{n-1}A_n$ that\n$\\alpha_n < \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\!-\\!\\beta$, then $$\\angle ABA_n \\;=\\;\\, \n\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\!-\\!\\alpha_n \\;>\\;\\, \\beta.$$ Then the line $b'$ falls\nafter penetrating $B$ into the inner territory of the triangle $ABA_n$.\nThereafter it must leave from there and thus intersect the side $AA_n$\nof this triangle. Accordingly, $b'$ intersects the line $a$.\n\nThe above reasoning is possible for each line $b' \\neq b$ through $B$.\nConsequently, the parallel axiom is in force.\n\n[8]{} : [*Lobatsevski geomeetria*]{}.
