  "definition": "A Hesse configuration is a set $P$ of nine non-collinear points in the\nprojective plane over a field $K$ such that any line through two points\nof $P$ contains exactly three points of $P$. Then there are 12 such\nlines through $P$. A Hesse configuration exists if and only if the field\n$K$ contains a primitive third root of unity. For such $K$ the\nprojective automorphism group $\\mathrm{PGL}(3, K)$ acts transitively on\nall possible Hesse configurations.\n\nThe configuration $P$ with its intersection structure of 12 lines is\nisomorphic to the affine space $A = \\mathbb{F}^2$ where $\\mathbb{F}$ is\na field with three elements.\n\nThe group $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathrm{PGL}(3, K)$ of all symmetries that map\n$P$ onto itself has order 216 and it is isomorphic to the group of\naffine transformations of $A$ that have determinant 1. The stabilizer in\n$\\Gamma$ of any of the 12 lines through $P$ is a cyclic subgroup of\norder three and $\\Gamma$ is generated by these subgroups.\n\nThe symmetry group $\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $G(K)/Z(K)$ where\n$G(K) \\subset \\mathrm{GL}(3, K)$ is a group of order 648 generated by\nreflections of order three and $Z(K)$ is its cyclic center of order\nthree. The reflection group $G(\\mathbb{C})$ is called the Hesse group\nwhich appears as $G_{25}$ in the classification of finite complex\nreflection groups by Shephard and Todd.\n\nIf $K$ is algebraically closed and the characteristic of $K$ is not 2 or\n3 then the nine inflection points of an elliptic curve $E$ over $K$ form\na Hesse configuration.",
