  "definition": "A [*parallelogram*]{} is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are\nparallel.\n\nSome special parallelograms have their own names: squares, rectangles,\nrhombuses. A rectangle is a parallelogram whose all angles are equal\n(i.e. $90^\\circ$), a rhombus is a parallelogram whose all sides are\nequal, and a square is a parallelogram that is a rectangle and a rhombus\nat the same time.\n\n![image](parallelograms)\n\nEvery parallelogram have their opposite sides and opposite angles equal.\nAlso, adjacent angles of a parallelogram always add up to $180^\\circ$,\nand the diagonals bisect each other.\n\nA *base* of a parallelogram is one of its sides. Any side of a\nparallelogram can be selected as its base. Once a base has been\nselected, the *height* of the parallelogram is defined to be the length\nof any line segment perpendicular to the base which extends from the\nbase to the opposite side parallel to the base. The area of a\nparallelogram with base length $b$ and height $h$ is given by the\nformula $A = bh$.\n\nThere is also a neat relation between the length of the sides and the\nlengths of the diagonals called the parallelogram law.",
