  "definition": "Let $AB$ be a line. Let $M,T$ be two points so that $M$ not lies on\n$AB$, $T$ lies on $AB$, and $MT$ perpendicular to $AB$. Let $MD$ be any\nother line who meets $AT$ in $D$.In a hyperbolic geometry, as $D$ moves\noff to infinity along $AT$ the line $MD$ meets the line $MS$ which is\nsaid to be parallel to $AT$. The angle $\\widehat{SMT}$ is called the\n*angle of parallelism* for perpendicular distance $d$, and is given by\n$$P(d)=2\\tan^{-1}(e^{-d}),$$ which is called *Lobachevsky\u2019s formula.*\n\n![image](lob)",
