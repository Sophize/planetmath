  "definition": "When inverting the polar coordinates, one needs the $\\arctan$ with two\narguments. If $(x,y)\\in {\\mathbbmss{R}}^2\\setminus\\{0\\}$, then $\n  \\arctan(x,y)\n$ is defined as the angle $(x,y)$ makes with the positive $x$-axis.\n\nOne usually sees expressions like $\\arctan(y/x)$, which is equal to\n$\\arctan(x,y)$ when $(x,y)$ is in the first quadrant. However,\n$\\arctan(y/x)$ does not give the correct angle when $(x,y)$ is in the\nthird quadrant (since $y/x=(-y)/(-x)$). Also, the quotient $y/x$\ninvolves a division by zero when $x=0$, which is damaging both\nnumerically and mathematically.\n\nIn most mathematical software and programming languages the two-argument\n$\\arctan$ is directly implemented.\n\nIn Python language the functions `atan(x)` and `atan2(x,y)` are the\nrespective one and two argument versions of $\\arctan$. The point of\nhaving the two argument version is to determine the correct quadrant of\nthe point. For instance, $1/1 = 1 = -1/-1$, so `atan(x)` cannot\ndistinguish between $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$, but `atan2(x,y)` can, as the\nfollowing Python code illustrates:\n\n    \\PMlinkescapetext{\n    >>> from math import *\n    >>> print atan(1)\n    0.785398163397\n    >>> print atan2(1,1)\n    0.785398163397\n    >>> print atan2(-1,-1)\n    -2.3619449019\n    }\n\nbecause $(1,1)$ has argument $\\pi/4=0.7853\\ldots$ but $(-1,-1)$ has\nargument $-3\\pi/4=-2.3619\\ldots$.\n\nAnalytic properties {#analytic-properties .unnumbered}\n===================\n\nIn mathematical works, $\\arctan(x,y)$ is simply denoted by\n$\\theta(x, y)$. The symbol $\\theta$ obviously refers to the angle, but\nit is really the function $h_2$, where\n$$g(r, \\theta) = (r \\cos \\theta, r \\sin \\theta)\\,, \\quad h(x,y) = g^{-1}(x, y) = (r, \\theta)\\,.$$\nThe function $g \\colon {\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\to {\\mathbbmss{R}}^2$ is the\npolar-to-Cartesian coordinate transformation. By the inverse function\ntheorem, the function $h$ (the Cartesian-to-polar coordinate\ntransformation) exists and is smooth wherever it is defined. Note that\n$h$ cannot be defined continuously everywhere, because of the\nmulti-valued nature of $\\theta$ \u2014 $(r, \\theta)$ and\n$(r, \\theta + 2\\pi n)$ always map to the same point under $g$.\n(Similarly, $\\theta$ cannot defined when $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 0$.)\nThis means, if one chases a loop (say a circle) around the origin,\n$\\theta$ would move from $0$ to $2\\pi$, even though the image point\n$g(r, \\theta)$ winds back to the starting point.\n\nTechnically, a \u201clargest\u201d possible domain of $h$ (and $\\theta$) can only\nbe taken to be some simply connected open subset of\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. (Note:\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ itself is not simply connected.) For\nexample, such a domain might be\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\setminus \\{ (x, y) : x \\leq 0 \\}$, i.e. delete the\nnegative real axis from ${\\mathbbmss{R}}^2$.\n\nThe exterior derivative of $\\theta$ is\n$$d\\theta = \\frac{-y}{x^2 + y^2} \\, dx + \\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \\, dy \\,,$$\n(found by implicit differentiation), and hence\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} = \\frac{-y}{x^2 + y^2}\\,, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} = \\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}$$ (which can\nalso be found by differentiating $\\arctan(y/x)$ directly and piecing the\nresults for each quadrant).\n\nOf course, the formulas above are only valid wherever $\\theta$ is\ndefined, but the analytical expressions do not change no matter which\ndomain of definition is taken for $\\theta$. This allows for the\nfollowing neat formula to find the total variation of angle of a smooth\ncurve $\\gamma \\colon [a, b] \\to {\\mathbbmss{R}}^2 \\setminus \\{0 \\}$:\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} d\\theta = \\int_a^b \\gamma^* d\\theta\n= \\int_a^b \\left( \\frac{-y \\dot{x} }{x^2 + y^2} + \\frac{x \\dot{y}}{x^2 + y^2} \\right) \\, dt\\,.$$\n(This is related to the formula for the winding number and the argument\nprinciple in complex analysis.)\n\nFor example, if $\\gamma(t) = (r \\cos t, r \\sin t)$, for\n$t \\in [0, 2\\pi n]$, is the circle that winds around the origin $n$\ntimes, then $\\int_{\\gamma} d\\theta = 2\\pi n$.",
