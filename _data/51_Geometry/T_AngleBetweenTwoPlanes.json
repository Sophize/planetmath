  "definition": "Let $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ be two planes in the three-dimensional Euclidean\nspace $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The angle $\\theta$ between these planes is defined\nby means of the normal vectors $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_2$\nof $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ through the relationship\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\Big| \\frac{\\langle \\boldsymbol{n}_1,\\boldsymbol{n}_2\\rangle }{\\| \\boldsymbol{n}_1 \\| \\| \\boldsymbol{n}_2 \\|}\\Big|,$$\nwhere the numerator is the inner product of $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_2$ and the denominator is product of the lengths of\n$\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_2$. The formula implies that the\nangle $\\theta$ satisfies $$0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$$\n\nThe quotient in the formula remains unchanged as one multiplies the\nnormal vectors by some non-zero real numbers, so that the cosine is\nindependent of the lengths of the chosen vectors. Therefore, there is no\nambiguity in this definition.\n\n![Angle between two planes](angle.eps)\n\n**Generalization**. The above definition can be generalized, at least\nlocally, to a pair of intersecting differentiable surfaces in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. Given two differentiable surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ and a\npoint $p\\in S_1\\cap S_2$, the angle between $S_1$ and $S_2$ at $p$ is\ndefined to be the angle between the tangent planes $T_p(S_1)$ and\n$T_p(S_2)$.",
