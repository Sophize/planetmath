  "statement": "If an hexagon $ADBFCE$ (not necessarily convex) is inscribed into a\nconic (in particular into a circle), then the points of intersections of\nopposite sides ($AD$ with $FC$, $DB$with $CE$ and $BF$ with $EA$) are\ncollinear. This line is called the *Pascal line* of the hexagon.\n\nA very special case happens when the conic degenerates into two lines,\nhowever the theorem still holds although this particular case is usually\ncalled Pappus theorem.\n\n![image](hexpasc)",
