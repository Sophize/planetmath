  "definition": "**Definition**. An $S(\\tau,\\kappa,\\nu)$ [**Steiner system**]{} is a\n$\\tau$-$(\\nu,\\kappa,1)$ design (i.e.\u00a0$\\lambda=1$). The values\n$\\tau,\\kappa,\\nu$ are the parameters of the Steiner system.\n\nSince $\\lambda=1$, a Steiner system is a simple design, and therefore we\nmay interpret a block to [*be*]{} a set of points ($B=\\mathcal{P}_B$),\nwhich we will do from now on.\n\nGiven parameters $\\tau,\\kappa,\\nu$, there may be several non-isomorphic\nsystems, or no systems at all.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ be an $S(\\tau,\\kappa,\\nu)$ system with point set\n$\\mathcal{P}$ and block set $\\mathcal{B}$, and choose a point\n$P\\in \\mathcal{P}$ (often, the system is so symmetric that it makes no\ndifference which point you choose). The choice uniquely induces an\n$S(\\tau-1,\\kappa-1,\\nu-1)$ system $\\mathcal{S}_1$ with point set\n$\\mathcal{P}_1 = \\mathcal{P}\\setminus \\{P\\}$ and block set\n$\\mathcal{B}_1$ consisting of $B\\setminus\\{P\\}$ for only those\n$B\\in\\mathcal{B}$ that contained $P$. This works because for any\n$T_1\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}_1$ with $|T_1|=\\tau-1$ there was a unique\n$B\\in\\mathcal{B}$ that contained $T=T_1\\cup\\{P \\}$.\n\nThis recurses down all the way to $\\tau=1$ (a partition of $\\nu-\\tau+1$\ninto blocks of $\\kappa-\\tau+1$) and finally to $\\tau=0$ (one arbitrary\nblock of $\\kappa-\\tau$). If any of the divisibility conditions (see the\nentry for more detail) on the way there do not hold, there cannot exist\na Steiner system with the original parameters either.\n\nFor instance, [**Steiner triple systems**]{} $S(2,3,\\nu)$ (the first\nSteiner systems studied, by Kirkman, before Steiner) exist for $\\nu=0$\nand all $\\nu\\equiv1$ or $3\\pmod6$, and no other $\\nu$.\n\nThe reverse construction, turning an $S(\\tau,\\kappa,\\nu)$ into an\n$S(\\tau+1, \\kappa+1, \\nu+1)$, need not be unique and may be impossible.\nFamously an $S(4,5,11)$ and a $S(5,6,12)$ have the Mathieu groups\n$M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ as their automorphism groups, while $M_{22}$,\n$M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ are those of an $S(3,6,22)$, $S(4,7,23)$ and\n$S(5,8,24)$, with connexions to the binary Golay code and the Leech\nlattice.\n\n**Remark**. A *Steiner system* $S(t,k,n)$ can be equivalently\ncharacterized as a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that\nevery set of $t$ vertices is contained in exactly one edge. Notice that\nany $S(2,k,n)$ is just a $k$-uniform linear space.",
