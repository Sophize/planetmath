  "definition": "One can construct new near-linear spaces from old. We name a few of the\nconstructions in this entry.\n\nLet $\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$ be a near-linear space.\n\n**Restrictions**. A pair $\\mathscr{S}':=(\\mathcal{P}',\\mathcal{L}')$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}'\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$, and\n$\\mathcal{L}':= \\lbrace \\mathcal{P}'\\cap \\ell \\mid \\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}\\rbrace$,\nis called a *restriction* of $\\mathscr{S}$.\n\nIt is easy to verify that a restriction of a near-linear space is\nnear-linear, and a restriction of a linear space is linear.\n\nFor example, let $\\mathscr{S}$ be a near-linear space given by the\ndiagram below:\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (-1,0)(1,0) (0,1)(1,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n\nThen $\\mathscr{S}$ has 7 restrictions, no two of which are isomorphic.\nBesides the empty space $\\varnothing$ and $\\mathscr{S}$ itself, the\nfollowing diagram shows the other five, with increasing number of lines:\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,0)\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (0,0)\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (-1,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (-1,0)(1,0)\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (-1,0) (0,0) (-1,0)(0,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n\nHere is another example. The (affine) Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{E}^2$ is\na linear space. The rational plane, formed by all points with rational\ncoordinates, and lines with rational coefficients, is a restriction of\n$\\mathbb{E}^2$. More generally, let $A(V)$ be an affine space over some\nvector space over some field $K$. If $k$ is a subfield of $K$, then\n$A(V')$ is a restriction of $A(V)$, where $V'$ is the restriction of $V$\nto $k$, consisting of vectors in $V$ whose components are elements of\n$k$.\n\nIn the study of projective planes, restrictions of finite projective\nplanes play an important role. A restriction of a projective plane is\ncalled a *subplane* if the restriction itself is a projective plane.\n*Sublines* are defined similarly. Bruck showed that if a projective\nplane has order $n$ and a subplane has order $m$, then $n=m^2$ or\n$n\\ge m^2+m$.\n\n**Subspaces**. Call a subset $\\mathcal{P}'$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ *linear* if\nfor any distinct $P, Q\\in \\mathcal{P}'$, $PQ\\in \\mathcal{L}$ implies\n$PQ \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}'$. In other words, if two points on a line are\nin $\\mathcal{P}'$, all of the points on the line are in $\\mathcal{P}'$.\n\nA *subspace* of $\\mathscr{S}$ is a pair\n$\\mathscr{S}':=(\\mathcal{P}',\\mathcal{L}')$, where\n$\\mathcal{P}'\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$ is linear, and\n$\\mathcal{L}':= \\lbrace \\ell \\in \\mathcal{L} \\mid \\ell\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}'\\rbrace$.\n\nSubspace are restrictions. Thus, subspaces of near-linear and linear\nspaces are near-linear and linear, respectively.\n\nIn the first example above, all of the restrictions of $\\mathscr{S}$,\nexcept the last one with two lines, are subspaces of $\\mathscr{S}$. The\nlast restriction is not a subspace because one of its lines is not a\nline of $\\mathscr{S}$.\n\nIn the second example above, the affine space $A(V')$, while a\nrestriction of $A(V)$, is not a subspace of $A(V)$.\n\nThe subspaces of affine (projective) spaces coincide with the usual\ndefinitions of subspaces of affine (projective) spaces. If a restriction\n$A'$ of an affine space $A$ is a subspace of $A$ with the same\ndimension, then $A'=A$.\n\nIn the set $\\mathbf{S}$ of all subspaces of $\\mathscr{S}$, we write\n$\\mathscr{U}\\le \\mathscr{V}$ if $\\mathscr{U}$ is a subspace of\n$\\mathscr{V}$. Then $\\le$ is a partial order on $\\mathbf{S}$. A maximal\nelement in $\\mathbf{S}$ is called a *hyperplane*.\n\n**Dual Spaces**. Another way of constructing a new space out of the\nexisting one is that of a dual space. Let\n$\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$ be a near-linear space. The dual\nspace $\\mathscr{S}^*$ of $\\mathscr{S}$ is a pair\n$(\\mathcal{P}^*,\\mathcal{L}^*)$ such that\n\n-   $\\mathcal{P}^*=\\mathcal{L}$, and\n\n-   $\\mathcal{L}^*=\\lbrace P^* \\mid P\\in \\mathcal{P}\\mbox{ and }|P^*|\\ge 2\\rbrace$,\n    where $P^*$ is the set of all lines passing through $P$.\n\nThe incidence relation on $\\mathscr{S}^*$ is the usual set membership\n$\\in$. One easily checks that $\\mathscr{S}^*$ is a near-linear space.\n\nBelow are diagrams of the example $\\mathscr{S}$ above, now with labels,\nand its dual space $\\mathscr{S}^*$ (on the right):\n\n(-1,0)(1,2) (0,1) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (-1,0)(1,0) (0,1)(1,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n(0.1,1)[$P$]{} (-1.1,0)[$Q$]{} (0,0.15)[$R$]{} (1.1,0)[$S$]{}\n(-0.65,0.5)[$\\ell_1$]{} (0.65,0.5)[$\\ell_2$]{} (-0.5,-0.15)[$\\ell_3$]{}\n\n(-1,0)(1,2) (0,1) (-1,0) (1,0) (-1,0)(1,0) (0,1)(1,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n(0.1,1)[$\\ell_1$]{} (-1.1,0)[$\\ell_2$]{} (1.1,0)[$\\ell_3$]{}\n(-0.65,0.5)[$P^*$]{} (0.65,0.5)[$Q^*$]{} (0,-0.15)[$S^*$]{}\n\nNote that the dual space $\\mathscr{S}^{**}$ of $\\mathscr{S}^*$ is\nisomorphic to $\\mathscr{S}^*$. This example shows that, in general, the\ndouble dual of a near-linear space is not isomorphic to itself.\n\n[7]{} L. M.
