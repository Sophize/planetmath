  "definition": "In this entry, we prove some of the basic properties of affine\ntransformations. Let $\\alpha:A_1\\to A_2$ be an affine transformation and\n$[\\alpha]:V_1\\to V_2$ its associated linear transformation.\n\n$\\alpha$ is one-to-one iff $[\\alpha]$ is.\n\nNext, suppose $\\alpha$ is one-to-one, and $T(v)=0$ for some $v\\in V_1$.\nLet $P,Q\\in A_1$ with $f_1(P,Q)=v$. Then\n$0=[\\alpha](v) = [\\alpha](f_1(P,Q))=f_1(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))$, which\nimplies that $\\alpha(P)=\\alpha(Q)$, and therefore $P=Q$ by assumption.\nConversely, suppose $[\\alpha]$ is one-to-one, and $\\alpha(P)=\\alpha(Q)$.\nThen $[\\alpha](f_1(P,Q))=f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))=0$, so that\n$f_1(P,Q)=0$, and consequently $P=Q$, showing that $\\alpha$ is\none-to-one.\n\n$\\alpha$ is onto iff $[\\alpha]$ is.\n\nSuppose $\\alpha$ is onto. Let $w\\in V_2$, so there are $X,Y\\in A_2$ such\nthat $f_2(X,Y)=w$. Since $\\alpha$ is onto, there are $P,Q\\in A_1$ with\n$\\alpha(P)=X$ and $\\alpha(Q)=Y$. So\n$w=f_2(X,Y)=f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q)) = [\\alpha](f_1(P,Q))$. Hence\n$[\\alpha]$ is onto. Conversely, assume $[\\alpha]$ be onto, and pick\n$Y\\in A_2$. Take an arbitrary point $P\\in A_1$ and set $X=\\alpha(P)$.\nThere is $v\\in V_1$ such that $[\\alpha](v)=f_2(X,Y)$, since $[\\alpha]$\nis onto. Let $Q\\in A_1$ such that $f_1(P,Q)=v$. Then\n$f_2(X,\\alpha(Q)) = f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))= [\\alpha](f_1(P,Q))=[\\alpha](v)=f_2(X,Y)$.\nBut $f_2(X,-)$ is a bijection, we must have $Y=\\alpha(Q)$, showing that\n$\\alpha$ is onto.\n\n$\\alpha$ is a bijection iff $[\\alpha]$ is.\n\nA bijective affine transformation $\\alpha:A_1\\to A_2$ is an affine\nisomorphism.\n\nSuppose an affine transformation $\\alpha: A_1\\to A_2$ is a bijection. We\nwant to show that $\\alpha^{-1}:A_2\\to A_1$ is an affine transformation.\nPick any $X,Y\\in A_2$, then\n$$[\\alpha](f_1(\\alpha^{-1}(X),\\alpha^{-1}(Y))) = f_2(X,Y).$$ By the\ncorollary above, $[\\alpha]$ is bijective, and hence a linear\nisomorphism. So\n$$f_1(\\alpha^{-1}(X),\\alpha^{-1}(Y))=[\\alpha]^{-1}(f_2(X,Y)).$$ This\nshows that $\\alpha^{-1}$ is an affine transformation whose assoicated\nlinear transformation is $[\\alpha]^{-1}$.\n\nTwo affine spaces associated with the same vector space $V$ are affinely\nisomorphic.\n\nIn fact, all we need to do is to show that $(A,f)$ is isomorphic to\n$(V,g)$, where $g$ is given by $g(v,w)=w-v$. Pick any $P\\in A$, then\n$\\alpha:=f(P,-):A\\to V$ is a bijection. For any $v\\in V$, there is a\nunique $Q\\in A$ such that $v=f(P,Q)$. Then\n$1_V(f(X,Y))=f(X,Y)=f(P,Y)-f(P,X)=\\alpha(Y)-\\alpha(X)=g(\\alpha(X),\\alpha(Y))$,\nshowing that $1_V$ is the associated linear transformation of $\\alpha$.\n\nAny affine transformation is a linear transformation between the\ncorresponding induced vector spaces. In other words, if\n$\\alpha: A \\to B$ is affine, then $\\alpha: A_P \\to B_{\\alpha(P)}$ is\nlinear.\n\nSuppose $Q,R,S\\in A$ are such that $Q+R=S$, or\n$f_1(P,Q)+f_1(P,R)=f_1(P,S)$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\nf_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(S)) &=& [\\alpha](f_1(P,S)) \\\\ \n&=& [\\alpha](f_1(P,Q)+f_1(P,R)) \\\\ \n&=& [\\alpha](f_1(P,Q))+[\\alpha](f_1(P,R)) \\\\\n&=& f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))+f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(R)),\\end{aligned}$$\nwhich is equivalent to $\\alpha(Q) + \\alpha(R) = \\alpha(S)= \\alpha(Q+R)$.\n\nNext, suppose $dQ=R$, or $df_1(P,Q)=f_1(P,R)$, where $d\\in D$. Then\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nf_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(R)) &=& [\\alpha](f_1(P,R)) \\\\ \n&=& [\\alpha](df_1(P,Q)) \\\\ \n&=& d[\\alpha](f_1(P,Q)) \\\\\n&=& df_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q)),\\end{aligned}$$ which is equivalent to\n$d\\alpha(Q)=\\alpha(R)=\\alpha(dQ)$.\n\nIf $(V,f)$ is an affine space associated with the vector space $V$, then\nthe direction $f$ is given by $f(v,w)=T(w-v)$ for some linear\nisomorphism (invertible linear transformation) $T$.\n\nBy proposition 4, $(V,f)$ is affinely isomorphic to $(V,g)$ with\n$g(v,w)=w-v$. Suppose $\\alpha:(V,f) \\to (V,g)$ is the affine\nisomorphism. Then\n$[\\alpha](f(v,w))=g(\\alpha(v),\\alpha(w))=\\alpha(w)-\\alpha(v)$. Since\n$[\\alpha]$ is a linear isomorphism,\n$f(v,w)=[\\alpha]^{-1}(\\alpha(w))-[\\alpha]^{-1}(\\alpha(v))$. By\nproposition 5, $\\alpha$ itself is linear, so\n$f(v,w)=([\\alpha]^{-1}\\circ \\alpha)(w-v)$. Set\n$T=[\\alpha]^{-1}\\circ \\alpha$. Then $T$ is linear and invertible since\n$\\alpha$ is, our assertion is proved.",
