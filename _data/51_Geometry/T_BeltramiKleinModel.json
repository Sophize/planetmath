  "definition": "The *Beltrami-Klein model* for $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the disc\n$\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x^2+y^2<1 \\}$ in which a point is similar to\nthe Euclidean point and a line is defined to be a chord (excluding its\nendpoints) of the (circular) boundary.\n\n(-2,-2)(2,2) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,0)(1.414,1.414)\n\nThe Beltrami-Klein model has the advantage that lines in the model\nresemble Euclidean lines; however, it has the drawback that it is not\nangle preserving. That is, the Euclidean of an angle within the model is\nnot necessarily the angle measure in hyperbolic geometry.\n\nSome points outside of the Beltrami-Klein model are important for\nconstructions within the model. The following is an example of such:\n\nLet $\\ell$ be a line in the Beltrami-Klein model that is not a diameter\nof the circle. The *pole* of $\\ell$ is the intersection of the Euclidean\nlines that are to the circle at the endpoints of $\\ell$.\n\n(-3,-2)(3,5) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-2)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-2,0)(1.414,1.414) (0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{} (-2,4.4) (-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{}\n(-2,-2)[.]{} (-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{}\n\nPoles are important for the following reason: Given a line $\\ell$ that\nis not a diameter of the Beltrami-Klein model, one constructs a line\nperpendicular to $\\ell$ by considering Euclidean lines passing through\n$P(\\ell)$. Thus, given two disjointly parallel lines $\\ell$ and $m$ that\nare not diameters of the Beltrami-Klein model, one constructs their\ncommon perpendicular by connecting their poles.\n\n(-3,-3)(3,5.1) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-3)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-2.4,-0.7)(0.4,-2.8) (-0.4,-2.8)(2.4,-0.7) (-2,0)(1.414,1.414)\n(0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{} (-1.2,-1.6)(1.2,-1.6) (0.8,-1.6)[$m$]{}\n(-2,4.4)(0,-2.5) (-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{} (0.2,-2.5)[$P(m)$]{}\n(-2,-3)[.]{} (-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{} (-2.2,5.09)(0.1,-2.845)\n(-1,1.4)[$n$]{}\n\nIn the above picture, $n$ is the common perpendicular of $\\ell$ and $m$.",
