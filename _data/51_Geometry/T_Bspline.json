  "definition": "### B-spline basis functions {#b-spline-basis-functions .unnumbered}\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{s}:=\\lbrace s_i\\mid i\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\rbrace$ be a\nsequence of nondecreasing real numbers ($s_i\\le s_{i+1}$). For each $i$,\nwe recursively define a set of real-valued functions $N_{i,j}$ (for\n$j=0,1,\\ldots$) as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}\nN_{i,0}(t)&:=&\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\mbox{ if } s_i\\leq t<s_{i+1}\\\\\n0 & \\mbox{ otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n\\\\\nN_{i,j+1}(t)&:=&\\alpha_{i,j+1}(t) N_{i,j}(t) + [1-\\alpha_{i+1,j+1}(t)] N_{i+1,j}(t)\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha_{i,j}(t) &:=& \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\displaystyle{\\frac{t - s_i}{s_{i+j} - s_i}} & \\mbox{ if } s_{i+j}\\ne s_i \\\\\n0 & \\mbox{ otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}$$ **Definitions**. Using the notations\nabove:\n\n1.  the sequence $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is known as a *knot sequence*, and the\n    individual term in the sequence is a *knot*;\n\n2.  the functions $N_{i,j}$ are called the *$i$-th B-spline basis\n    functions of order $j$*, and the recurrence relation is called the\n    *de Boor recurrence relation*, after its discoverer Carl de Boor;\n\n3.  given any non-negative integer $j$, the vector space\n    $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$ over $\\mathbb{R}$, generated by the set of all\n    B-spline basis functions of order $j$ is called the *B-spline of\n    order $j$*. In other words, the B-spline\n    $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s}):=\\operatorname{span}\\lbrace N_{i,j}(t)\\mid i=0,1,\\ldots \\rbrace$\n    over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  Any element of $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$ is a *B-spline function* of\n    order $j$.\n\nThe $0$th order B-spline basis functions are nothing more than\ncharacteristic functions on half-open intervals (or the zero function if\n$s_i=s_{i+1}$). When $j=1,2,3$, the B-spline basis functions are said to\nbe *linear*, *quadratic*, or *cubic*.\n\nThe calculations of the higher order B-spline basis functions can be\neasily understood by use of triangular difference tables. For example,\nto calculate $N_{53}$, one would use $$\\xymatrix @R=1pt @C=1.5cm {\ns_5\\! & \\! N_{5,0} \\ar@{->}[rd] & & &\\\\\n & & \\! N_{5,1} \\ar@{->}[rd] & &\\\\\ns_6\\! & \\! N_{6,0} \\ar@{->}[rd] \\ar@{->}[ru] & & N_{5,2} \\ar@{->}[rd] &\\\\\n & & \\! N_{6,1} \\ar@{->}[rd] \\ar@{->}[ru] & & N_{5,3}\\\\\ns_7\\! & \\! N_{7,0} \\ar@{->}[rd] \\ar@{->}[ru] & & N_{6,2} \\ar@{->}[ru] &\\\\\n & & \\! N_{7,1} \\ar@{->}[ru] & &\\\\\ns_8\\! & \\! N_{8,0} \\ar@{->}[ru] & & &\n}$$ **Remarks**.\n\n-   Each B-spline basis function $N_{i,j}$ is completely defined by the\n    finite set $\\lbrace s_i,\\ldots, s_{i+j+1}\\rbrace$ of knots.\n    Furthermore, it is\n\n    1.  non-zero in the open interval $(s_i,s_{i+j+1})$,\n\n    2.  $N_{i,j}$ restricted to each subinterval $[s_k,s_{k+1})$ is a\n        polynomial function of degree $j$ for $k=i,\\ldots, i+j$, and\n\n    3.  identically $0$ outside the interval $[s_i,s_{i+j+1})$.\n\n-   In $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$, the non-zero B-spline basis functions of\n    order $j$ are linearly independent. In other words, the set of all\n    non-zero $N_{i,j}$ forms a basis for $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$ and hence\n    the name B-spline *basis* functions.\n\n-   Given a knot sequence $\\boldsymbol{s}$, a knot $s_i$ is said to be\n    *knotted* if $s_i=s_{i+1}$. It is a double knot if\n    $s_{i-1}<s_i=s_{i+1}<s_{i+2}$. Triple knots and more generally\n    $n$-multi knots are defined analogously. A knot sequence is knotted\n    if it contains a knotted knot.\n\n-   If a knot sequence is not knotted, then it can be shown that the\n    B-spline basis function $N_{i,j}$ is $C^{j-1}$ but not of $C^j$. For\n    example, $N_{i,1}$ is continuous but not differentiable.\n\n-   If a knot sequence $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is finite and not knotted, then\n    $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$ is finite dimensional. If $\\boldsymbol{s}$ has\n    $n$ knots, then $V_j(\\boldsymbol{s})$ has dimension $n-j$ for $j<n$,\n    and $0$ otherwise.\n\n### B-spline curves {#b-spline-curves .unnumbered}\n\nIn most applications of B-splines, finite knot sequences are considered.\nA finite knot sequence $\\lbrace s_0,\\ldots, s_n\\rbrace$ is also known as\na *knot vector*.\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\lbrace s_0,\\ldots, s_n\\rbrace$ be a knot vector.\nLet $P_0,\\ldots, P_m$ be $m+1$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ (usually $k=2$\nor $3$). Then we may form a linear combination\n$$P(t)=\\sum_{i=0}^m P_i N_{i,j}(t),$$ where $P_i N_{i,j}(t)$ is the\nscalar multiplication of the scalar $N_{i,j}(t)$ by the vector $P_i$.\nThis is possible only when there are at least as many $N_{i,j}$ (there\nare $n+1-j$ of them) as there are $P_i$ (there are $m$ of them). In\nother words, $m\\le n+1-j$. Set $p=n+1-m$. Then the function defined by\n$$P(t)=\\sum_{i=0}^m P_i N_{i,p}(t)$$ is called a *B-spline curve* with\n*control points* $P_1,\\ldots, P_m$. Note that $P(t)$ is completely\ndetermined by the control points and the knot vector $\\boldsymbol{s}$,\nand each coordinate of $P(t)$ is a B-spline function in\n$V_p(\\boldsymbol{s})$.\n\nMore to come...",
