  "statement": "If a line segment has been divided into two parts such that the greater\npart is the central proportional of the whole segment and the smaller\npart, then one has performed the [*golden section*]{} (Latin [*sectio\naurea*]{}) of the line segment.\\\n**Theorem.** The side of the , inscribed in a circle, is equal to the\ngreater part of the radius divided with the .\n\n[*Proof.*]{} A . In the picture below, there is seen an isosceles\ncentral triangle $OAB$ of a regular decagon with the central angle\n$O = 360^\\circ\\!:\\!10 = 36^\\circ$; the base angles are\n$(180^\\circ\\!-\\!36^\\circ)\\!:\\!2 = 72^\\circ$. One of the base angles is\nhalved with the line $AC$, when one gets a smaller isosceles triangle\n$ABC$ with equal angles as in the triangle $OAB$. From these similar\ntriangles we obtain the proportion equation $$\\begin{aligned}\n               r:s \\,=\\, s:(r\\!-\\!s),\\end{aligned}$$ which shows that\nthe side $s$ of the regular decagon is the central proportional of the\nradius $r$ of the circle and the difference $r\\!-\\!s$.\n\n(0,0)(8,5) (0,0)[7]{}[-4]{}[40]{} (0,0)(7,0)(5.663,4.114)\n(4.326,0)(5.663,4.114) (0,0)(7,0)(5.663,4.114)(4.326,0) (0,-0.3)[$O$]{}\n(7.2,-0.2)[$B$]{} (5.9,4.14)[$A$]{} (4.3,-0.3)[$C$]{} (2.35,1.9)[$r$]{}\n(2.4,-0.2)[$s$]{} (4.65,1.8)[$s$]{} (6.17,1.8)[$s$]{}\n(5.6,-0.2)[$r\\!-\\!s$]{} (0.67,0.22)[$36^\\circ$]{}\n(6.6,0.22)[$72^\\circ$]{} (5.1,3.3)[$36^\\circ$]{}\n(5.65,3.1)[$36^\\circ$]{} (4.8,0.22)[$72^\\circ$]{}\n\n**Note.** (1) can be simplified to the $$s^2\\!+\\!rs\\!-\\!r^2 = 0$$ which\nyields the positive solution\n$$s\\; =\\; \\frac{-1\\!+\\!\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\,r\\; \\approx\\; 0.618\\,r.$$ Cf. also\nthe golden ratio.",
