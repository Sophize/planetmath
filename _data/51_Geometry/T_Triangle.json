  "definition": "A *triangle* is a planar region delimited by three lines, i.e. it is a\npolygon with three angles.\n\n![image](triangulo)\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always equal to\n$180^\\circ$. In the figure: $A+B+C=180^\\circ$.\n\nIn hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always strictly\npositive and strictly less than $180^\\circ$. In the figure:\n$0^\\circ<A+B+C<180^\\circ$.\n\nIn spherical geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always strictly\ngreater than $180^\\circ$ and strictly less than $540^\\circ$. In the\nfigure: $180^\\circ<A+B+C<540^\\circ$.\n\nAlso in spherical geometry, a triangle has these additional\nrequirements: It must be strictly contained in a hemisphere of the\nsphere that is serving as the model for spherical geometry, and all of\nits angles must have a measure strictly less that $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nTriangles can be classified according to the number of their equal\nsides. So, a triangle with 3 equal sides is called , a triangle with 2\nequal sides is called *isosceles*, and finally a triangle with no equal\nsides is called *scalene*. Notice that an is also isosceles, but there\nare isosceles triangles that are not equilateral.\n\n![image](trianglebyside)\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, triangles can also be classified according to the\nof the greatest of its three (inner) angles. If the greatest of these is\nacute (and therefore all three are acute), the triangle is called an\n*acute triangle*. If the triangle has a right angle, it is a *right\ntriangle*. If the triangle has an obtuse angle, it is an *obtuse\ntriangle*.\n\n![image](trianglebyangle)\n\n### Area of a triangle {#area-of-a-triangle .unnumbered}\n\nThere are several ways to a triangle\u2019s area.\n\nIn hyperbolic and spherical , the area of a triangle is equal to its\ndefect (measured in radians).\n\nFor the rest of this entry, only Euclidean geometry will be considered.\n\nMany for the area of a triangle exist. The most basic one is\n$\\displaystyle A=\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is its base and $h$ is its\nheight. Following is a of another for the area of a triangle.\n\nLet $a,b,c$ be the sides and $A,B,C$ the interior angles to them. Let\n$h_a,h_b,h_c $ be the heights drawn upon $a,b,c$ respectively, $r$ the\ninradius and $R$ the circumradius. Finally, let\n$\\displaystyle s=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ be the semiperimeter. Then\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Area} &=& \\frac{a h_a}{2}=\\frac{b h_b}{2}=\\frac{c h_c}{2}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{ab\\sin C}{2}=\\frac{bc\\sin A}{2}=\\frac{ca\\sin B}{2}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{abc}{4R}\\\\\n&=& sr\\\\\n&=& \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe last is known as Heron\u2019s formula.\n\nWith the coordinates of the vertices $(x_1,\\,y_1)$, $(x_2,\\,y_2)$,\n$(x_3,\\,y_3)$ of the triangle, the area may be expressed as\n$$\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\begin{matrix}\nx_1 & y_1 & 1\\\\\nx_2 & y_2 & 1\\\\\nx_3 & y_3 & 1\n\\end{matrix}\\right|$$ (cf. the volume of ).\n\nInequalities for the area are Weizenbock\u2019s inequality and the\nHadwiger-Finsler inequality.\n\n### Angles in a triangle {#angles-in-a-triangle .unnumbered}\n\n1.  the sum of the angles in a triangle is $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$)\n\n2.  sines law\n\n3.  cosines law\n\n4.
