  "definition": "Given a real constant $c$, the [*curve of Agnesi*]{} (often called\n[*witch of Agnesi*]{} in English) is the result of plotting the equation\n$$y = \\frac{8c}{4c^2 + x^2}$$ in the Cartesian plane. If we set\n$c = \\frac{1}{2}$, the equation simplifies to $y = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.\nAnother way of drawing the curve employs a circle of radius $c$.\n\nIn the following diagram, the associated circle is shown in light gray.\n\n![image](AgnesiCurve)\n\n(This diagram was made with Grapher 1.1 for Mac OS X).\n\nThis curve was first studied by Pierre de Fermat, but Maria Gaetana\nAgnesi later studied it in greater detail and mentioned it in her book\n[*Instituzioni Analitiche*]{}.",
