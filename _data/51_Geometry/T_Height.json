  "definition": "Let $ABC$ be a given triangle. A height of $ABC$ is a line segment drawn\nfrom a vertex to the opposite side (or its prolongations) and\nperpendicular to it. So we have three heights in any triangle. The three\nheights are always concurrent and the common point is called the\northocenter. In Euclidean geometry the length of the segment \u201cheight\u201d is\nsometimes referred to as the height.\n\nIn the following figure, $AD,BE$ and $CF$ are heights of $ABC$.\n\n(0,-0.4)(5,4.1) (0,0)(5,0)(2,4) (2,0)(2,4) (0,0)(3.2,2.4) (1,2)(5,0)\n(2,0.2)(2.2,0.2)(2.2,0) (3.04,2.28)(3.16,2.12)(3.32,2.24)\n(0.91,1.82)(1.09,1.73)(1.18,1.91) (2,4.1)[$A$]{} (0,-0.4)[$B$]{}\n(5,-0.4)[$C$]{} (2,-0.4)[$D$]{} (3.3,2.5)[$E$]{} (1,2.1)[$F$]{}",
