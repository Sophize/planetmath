  "definition": "Two distinct lines in the Euclidean plane are [*parallel*]{} to each\nother if and only if they do not intersect, if they have no common\npoint. By convention, a line is parallel to itself.\n\nThe [*parallelism*]{} of $l$ and $m$ is denoted $$l \\parallel m.$$\n\nParallelism is an equivalence relation on the set of the lines of the\nplane. Moreover, two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they\nhave the same slope. Thus, slope is a natural way of determining the\nequivalence classes of lines of the plane.",
