  "definition": "Let $(A_i,f_i)$ be affine spaces associated with a left (right) vector\nspaces $V_i$ (over some division ring $D$), where $i=1,2$. An *affine\ntransformation* from $A_1$ to $A_2$ is a function $\\alpha:A_1\\to A_2$\nsuch that there is a linear transformation $T:V_1\\to V_2$ such that\n$$T(f_1(P,Q))=f_2(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))$$ for any $P,Q\\in A$.\n\nNote that $T$ is uniquely determined by $\\alpha$, since $f_1$ is a\nfunction onto $V_1$. $T$ and is called the *associated linear\ntransformation* of $\\alpha$. Let us write $[\\alpha]$ the associated\nlinear transformation of $\\alpha$. Then the definition above can be\nillustrated by the following commutative diagram:\n$$\\xymatrix@+=2cm{A_1\\times A_1 \\ar[r]^-{f_1} \\ar[d]_{(\\alpha,\\alpha)} & V_1 \\ar[d]^{[\\alpha]} \\\\ A_2\\times A_2 \\ar[r]_-{f_2} & V_2}$$\n\nHere\u2019s an example of an affine transformation. Let $(A,f)$ be an affine\nspace with $V$ the associated vector space. Fix $v\\in V$. For each\n$P\\in A$, let $\\alpha(P)$ be the unique point in $A$ such that\n$f(P,\\alpha(P))=v$. Then $\\alpha:A\\to A$ is a well-defined function.\nFurthermore,\n$f(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))=v+f(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))-v = f(P,\\alpha(P))+f(\\alpha(P),\\alpha(Q))+f(\\alpha(Q),Q)= f(P,Q)=1_V(f(P,Q))$.\nThus $\\alpha$ is affine, with $[\\alpha]=1_V$.\n\nAn affine transformation $\\alpha:A_1\\to A_2$ is an *affine isomorphism*\nif there is an affine transformation $\\beta:A_2\\to A_1$ such that\n$\\beta\\circ \\alpha=1_{A_1}$ and $\\alpha\\circ \\beta = 1_{A_2}$. Two\naffine spaces $A_1$ and $A_2$ are *affinely isomorphic*, or simply,\nisomorphic, if there are affine isomorphism $\\alpha:A_1\\to A_2$.\n\nBelow are some basic properties of an affine transformation (see ):\n\n1.  $\\alpha$ is onto iff $[\\alpha]$ is.\n\n2.  $\\alpha$ is one-to-one iff $[\\alpha]$ is.\n\n3.  A bijective affine transformation $\\alpha$ is an affine isomorphism.\n    In fact, $[\\alpha^{-1}]=[\\alpha]^{-1}$.\n\n4.  Two affine spaces associated with the same vector space are\n    isomorphic.\n\nBecause of the last property, it is often enough, in practice, to\nidentify $V$ itself as *the* affine space associated with $V$, up to\naffine isomorphism, with the direction given by $f(v,w)=w-v$. With this\nin mind, we may reformulate the definition of an affine transformation\nas a mapping $\\alpha$ from one vector space $V$ to another, $W$, such\nthat there is a linear transformation $T:V\\to W$ such that\n$$T(w-v)=\\alpha(w)-\\alpha(v).$$ By fixing $w\\in V$, we get the following\nequation $$\\alpha(v)=T(v)+(\\alpha(w)-T(w)).$$\n\nLet $V$ and $W$ be left vector spaces over the same division ring $D$.\nAn *affine transformation* is a mapping $\\alpha:\\colon V \\to W$ such\nthat $$\\alpha(v)=T(v)+w, \\quad v\\in V$$ for some linear transformation\n$T\\colon V\\to W$ and some vector $w\\in W$.\n\nAn *affine property* is a geometry property that is preserved by an\naffine transformation. The following are affine properties of an affine\ntransformation Let $A:V\\to W$:\n\n-   linearity. Given an affine subspace $S+v$ of $V$, then\n    $A(S+v)=L(S+v)+w=L(S)+(L(v)+w)$ is an affine subspace of $W$.\n\n-   incidence. Suppose $S+v\\subseteq T+u$. Pick\n    $x\\in A(S+v)=L(S)+L(v)+w$, so $x=y+L(v)+w$ where $y\\in L(S)$. Since\n    $L$ is bijective, there is $z\\in S$ such that $L(z)=y$. So\n    $A(z+v)=L(z)+L(v)+w=x$. Since $z+v\\in S+v$, $z+v=t+u$ for some\n    $t\\in T$, $x=A(z+v)=A(t+u)\\in A(T+u)$. Therefore,\n    $A(S+v)\\subseteq A(T+u)$.\n\n-   parallelism. Given two parallel affine subspaces $S+a$ and $S+b$,\n    then $A(S+a)=L(S)+(L(a)+w)$ and $A(S+b)=L(S)+(L(b)+w)$ are parallel.\n\n-   coefficients of an affine combination. Given that $v$ is an affine\n    combination of $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$: $$v=k_1v_1+\\cdots +k_nv_n,$$ where\n    $k_i\\in F\\mbox{ and }k_1+\\cdots+k_n=1$ are the corresponding\n    coefficients. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n    A(v) &=& k_1L(v_1)+\\cdots+k_nL(v_n)+w \\\\\n    &=& k_1(L(v_1)+w)+\\cdots+k_n(L(v_n)+w) \\\\\n    &=& k_1A(v_1)+\\cdots+k_nA(v_n)\\end{aligned}$$ is the affine\n    combination of $A(v_1),\\ldots,A(v_n)$ with the same set of\n    coefficients.\n\n### Special Affine Transformations {#special-affine-transformations .unnumbered}\n\n1.  **translation**. An affine transformation of the form $A(v)=v+w$ is\n    called a *translation*. Every affine transformation can be\n    decomposed as a product of a linear transformation and a\n    translation: $A(v)=L(v)+w=BC(v)$ where $C(v)=L(v)$ and $B(v)=v+w$.\n    The order of composition is important, since $BC\\neq CB$.\n    Geometrically, a translation moves a geometric figure along a\n    straight line.\n\n2.  **dilation (map)**. If $L$ has a unique eigenvalue $d\\neq 0$ (that\n    is, $L$ may be diagonalized as $dI$, the diagonal matrix with\n    non-zero diagonal entries $=d\\in F$), then the affine transformation\n    $A(v)=L(v)$ is called a *dilation*. Note that a dilation may be\n    written as the product of a vector with a scalar: $A(v)=dv$, which\n    is why a dilation is also called a *scaling*. A dilation can be\n    visualized as magnifying or shrinking a geometric figure.\n\n3.  **homothetic transformation**. The composition of a dilation\n    followed by a translation is called a *homothetic transformation*.\n    It has the form $A(v)=dv+w$, $0\\neq d\\in F$.\n\n4.  Euclidean transformation. In the case when both $V$ and $W$ are\n    Euclidean vector spaces, if the associated linear transformation is\n    orthogonal, then the affine transformation is called a *Euclidean\n    transformation*.\n\n### Remarks {#remarks .unnumbered}\n\n1.  When $V=W$, the set of affine maps $V\\to V$, with function\n    composition as the product, becomes a group, and is denoted by\n    ${\\rm IGL}(V)$. The multiplicative identity is the identity map. If\n    $A(v)=L(v)+w$, then $A^{-1}(v)=L^{-1}(v)-L^{-1}(w)$. IGL is short\n    for ** of $V$. Translations, dilations, and homothetic\n    transformations all form subgroups of ${\\rm IGL}(V)$. If $T$ is the\n    group of translations, $D$ the group of dilations, and $H$ the group\n    of homothetic transformations, then $T$ is a normal subgroup of $T$.\n    Also, $\\operatorname{Aut}(T)$ and $\\operatorname{Aut}(D)$ are\n    abelian groups (remember: $F$ is assumed to be a field).\n\n2.  One can more generally define an affine transformation to be an\n    order-preserving bijection between two affine geometries. It can be\n    shown that this definition coincides with the above one if the\n    underlying field admits no non-trivial automorphisms. When the two\n    affine geometries are the same, the bijective affine transformation\n    is called an *affinity*.\n\n3.  Another way to generalize an affine transformation is to remove the\n    restriction on the invertibility of the linear transformation $L$.\n    In this respect, the set $A(V,W)$ of affine transformations from $V$\n    to $W$ has a natural vector space structure. It is easy to see that\n    the set $L(V,W)$ of linear transformations from $V$ to $W$ forms a\n    subspace of $A(V,W)$.",
