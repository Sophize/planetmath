  "definition": "The [*happy ending problem*]{} asks, for a given integer $n > 2$, to\nfind the smallest number $g(n)$ of points laid on a plane in general\nposition such that a subset of $n$ points can be made the vertices of a\nconvex $n$-agon.\n\n![Examples showing that $g(4)\\le 5$.](happy_end_4){width=\"3in\"}\n\nIt is obvious that for $n = 3$, just three points in general position\nare sufficient to create a triangle. For $n = 4$, Paul Erd\u0151s and Esther\nKlein (later Szekeres) determined that at least five points are\nnecessary, and Kalbfleisch later determined $g(5) = 9$. Much later,\nGeorge Szekeres (posthumously) and Lindsay Peters published a computer\nproof\u00a0[@cite:PS2006] that $g(6) = 17$.\n\nFor higher $n$, Erd\u0151s and George Szekeres in 1935 gave the upper bound\n$$g(n) \\le \\binom{2n - 4}{n - 2} + 1.$$ Later, in 1961 they gave the\nlower bound $g(n) \\geq 1 + 2^{n - 2}$.\n\nNew ideas for the upper bound were in the air in the late 1990s, with\nChung and Graham showing that if $n \\ge 4$, then\n$$g(n) \\le \\binom{2n - 4}{n - 2},$$ while Kleitman and Pachter showed\nthat then $$g(n) \\le \\binom{2n - 4}{n - 2} + 7 - 2n.$$ And G\u00e9za T\u00f3th and\nPavel Valtr in 1998 gave the upper bound\n$$g(n) \\leq {2n - 5 \\choose n - 3} + 2,$$ which in 2005 they refined to\n$$g(n) \\le \\binom{2n-5}{n-3} + 1.$$\n\n[9]{} F.\u00a0R.\u00a0K.\u00a0Chung and R.\u00a0L.\u00a0Graham, Forced convex $n$-gons in the\nplane, [*Discrete Comput.
