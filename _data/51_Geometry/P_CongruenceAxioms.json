  "statement": "**General Congruence Relations**. Let $A$ be a set and $X=A\\times A$. A\nrelation on $X$ is said to be a *congruence relation* on $X$, denoted\n$\\cong$, if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n\n1.  $(a,b)\\cong (b,a)$, for all $a,b\\in A$,\n\n2.  if $(a,a)\\cong (b,c)$, then $b=c$, where $a,b,c\\in A$,\n\n3.  if $(a,b)\\cong (c,d)$ and $(a,b)\\cong (e,f)$, then $(c,d)\\cong\n    (e,f)$, for any $a,b,c,d,e,f\\in A$.\n\nBy applying $(b,a)\\cong (a,b)$ twice, we see that $\\cong$ is reflexive\naccording to the third condition. From this, it is easy to that $\\cong$\nis symmetric, since $(a,b)\\cong (c,d)$ and $(a,b)\\cong (a,b)$ imply\n$(c,d)\\cong (a,b)$. Finally, $\\cong$ is transitive, for if\n$(a,b)\\cong (c,d)$ and $(c,d)\\cong\n(e,f)$, then $(c,d)\\cong (a,b)$ because $\\cong$ is symmetric and so\n$(a,b)\\cong (e,f)$ by the third condition. Therefore, the congruence\nrelation is an equivalence relation on pairs of elements of $A$.\\\n\\\n**Congruence Axioms in Ordered Geometry**. Let $(A,B)$ be an ordered\ngeometry with strict betweenness relation $B$. We say that the ordered\ngeometry $(A,B)$ satisfies the *congruence axioms* if\n\n1.  there is a congruence relation $\\cong$ on $A\\times A$;\n\n2.  if $(a,b,c)\\in B$ and $(d,e,f)\\in B$ with\n\n    -   $(a,b)\\cong (d,e)$, and\n\n    -   $(b,c)\\cong (e,f),$\n\n    then $(a,c)\\cong (d,f)$;\n\n3.  given $(a,b)$ and a ray $\\rho$ emanating from $p$, there exists a\n    unique point $q$ lying on $\\rho$ such that $(p,q)\\cong (a,b)$;\n\n4.  given the following:\n\n    -   three rays emanating from $p_1$ such that they intersect with a\n        line $\\ell_1$ at $a_1,b_1,c_1$ with $(a_1,b_1,c_1)\\in B$, and\n\n    -   three rays emanating from $p_2$ such that they intersect with a\n        line $\\ell_2$ at $a_2,b_2,c_2$ with $(a_2,b_2,c_2)\\in B$,\n\n    -   $(a_1,b_1)\\cong (a_2,b_2)$ and $(b_1,c_1)\\cong (b_2,c_2)$,\n\n    -   $(p_1,a_1)\\cong (p_2,a_2)$ and $(p_1,b_1)\\cong (p_2,b_2)$,\n\n    then $(p_1,c_1)\\cong (p_2,c_2)$;\n\n5.  given three distinct points $a,b,c$ and two distinct points $p,q$\n    such that $(a,b)\\cong (p,q)$. Let $H$ be a closed half plane with\n    boundary ${\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$. Then there exists a unique\n    point $r$ lying on $H$ such that $(a,c)\\cong (p,r)$ and\n    $(b,c)\\cong (q,r)$.\n\n**Congruence Relations on line segments, triangles, and angles**. With\nthe above five congruence axioms, one may define a congruence relation\n(also denoted by $\\cong$ by abuse of notation) on the set $S$ of closed\nline segments of $A$ by\n$$\\overline{ab}\\cong\\overline{cd}\\qquad \\mbox{ iff }\\qquad (a,b)\\cong (c,d),$$\nwhere $\\overline{ab}$ (in this entry) denotes the closed line segment\nwith endpoints $a$ and $b$.\n\nIt is obvious that the congruence relation defined on line segments of\n$A$ is an equivalence relation. Next, one defines a congruence relation\non triangles in $A$: $\\triangle abc\\cong \\triangle pqr$ if their sides\nare congruent:\n\n1.  $\\overline{ab}\\cong\\overline{pq}$,\n\n2.  $\\overline{bc}\\cong\\overline{qr}$, and\n\n3.  $\\overline{ca}\\cong\\overline{rp}$.\n\nWith this definition, Axiom 5 above can be restated as: given a triangle\n$\\triangle abc$, such that $\\overline{ab}$ is congruent to a given line\nsegment $\\overline{pq}$. Then there is exactly one point $r$ on a chosen\nside of the line ${\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$ such that\n$\\triangle abc\\cong\\triangle pqr$. Not surprisingly, the congruence\nrelation on triangles is also an equivalence relation.\\\n\\\nThe last major congruence relation in an ordered geometry to be defined\nis on angles: $\\angle abc$ is *congruent to* $\\angle\npqr$ if there are\n\n1.  a point $a_1$ on ${\\overrightarrow{ba}}$,\n\n2.  a point $c_1$ on ${\\overrightarrow{bc}}$,\n\n3.  a point $p_1$ on ${\\overrightarrow{qp}}$, and\n\n4.  a point $r_1$ on ${\\overrightarrow{qr}}$\n\nsuch that $\\triangle a_1bc_1\\cong \\triangle p_1qr_1$.\\\n\\\nIt is customary to also write $\\angle abc\\cong \\angle pqr$ to mean that\n$\\angle abc$ is congruent to $\\angle pqr$. Clearly for any points\n$x\\in{\\overrightarrow{ba}}$ and $y\\in{\\overrightarrow{bc}}$, we have\n$\\angle xby\\cong\n\\angle abc$, so that $\\cong$ is reflexive. $\\cong$ is also symmetric and\ntransitive (as the properties are inherited from the congruence relation\non triangles). Therefore, the congruence relation on angles also defines\nan equivalence relation.\n\n[6]{} D. Hilbert, [*Foundations of Geometry*]{}, Open Court Publishing\nCo. (1971) K. Borsuk and W.
