  "definition": "Sphere\n======\n\nA *sphere* is defined as the locus of the points in three dimensions\nthat are equidistant from a particular point called the *center*. Note\nthat the center of a sphere is unique.\n\nIt is generally assumed that the sphere is embedded in real-valued space\n($\\mathbb{R}^3$) unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe equation for a sphere centered at the origin is\n\n$$x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the length of the .\n\nA *unit sphere* is a sphere with radius 1.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3.$$\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is\n\n$$A = 4 \\pi r^2.$$\n\nGeneralization\n==============\n\nA sphere can be generalized to $n$ dimensions. For $n > 3$, a\ngeneralized sphere is called a *hypersphere* (when no value of $n$ is\ngiven, one can generally assume that \u201chypersphere\u201d means $n = 4$). In\nthe same manner, the definitions of center, radius, and unit sphere can\nalso be generalized to $n$ dimensions.\n\nThe formula for an $n$-dimensional sphere is\n\n$${x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + \\dots + {x_n}^2 = r^2$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the length of the radius. Note that when $n=2$, the formula\nreduces to the formula for a circle, so a circle is a 2-dimensional\n\u201csphere\u201d. A one dimensional sphere is a pair of points (filled-in, it\nwould be a line)!\n\nThe volume of an $n$-dimensional sphere with radius $r$ is\n\n$$V(n,r) = \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{n}{2}}r^n}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}$$\n\nwhere $\\Gamma(n)$ is the gamma function. Curiously, for any fixed $r$,\nthe volume of the $n$-d sphere approaches zero as $n$ approaches\ninfinity. Contrast this to the volume of an $n$-d box, which always has\na volume in proportion to $s^n$ (with $s$ the side length of the box)\nwhich increases without bound when $s \\ge 1$. Note that, for any\npositive integer $n$ and for any radius $r$, $V(n,r)=V(n,1)r^n$. Also\nnote that the volume of the $n$-d unit sphere $V(n,1)$ has a maximum\nprecisely at $n=5$.\n\nTo illustrate how to use the formula for $V(n,r)$ and to provide some\nevidence of the claims made about $V(n,r)$, the values $V(4,1)$,\n$V(5,1)$, and $V(6,1)$ will be calculated here.\n\n$\\begin{array}{lll|lll|ll}\nV(4,1) & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{4}{2}}1^4}{\\Gamma(\\frac{4}{2}+1)} & & V(5,1) & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{5}{2}}1^5}{\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2}+1)} & & V(6,1) & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^{\\frac{6}{2}}1^6}{\\Gamma(\\frac{6}{2}+1)} \\\\\n& & & & & & & \\\\\n& = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\Gamma(3)} & & & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^2 \\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2})} & & & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^3}{\\Gamma(4)} \\\\\n& & & & & & & \\\\\n& = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} & & & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^2 \\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\frac{15}{8} \\sqrt{\\pi}} & & & = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi^3}{6} \\\\\n& & & & & & & \\\\\n& \\approx 4.9348 & & & = \\displaystyle \\frac{8\\pi^2}{15} & & & \\approx 5.1677 \\\\\n& & & & & & & \\\\\n& & & & \\approx 5.2638 & & & \\end{array}$\n\nTopological Treatment\n=====================\n\nIn topology and other contexts, spheres are treated slightly\ndifferently. Let the $n$-*sphere* be the set\n\n$$S^n = \\{ x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1} : ||x|| = 1 \\}$$\n\nwhere $|| \\cdot ||$ can be any norm, usually the Euclidean norm. Notice\nthat $S^n$ is defined here as a subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}$.\n\nThus, $S^0$ is two points on the real line:\n\n(-1.5,-0.8)(1.5,0.5) (-1.21,0)(1.21,0) (-1,0)(1,0) (-1,0)[$-1$]{}\n(1,0)[$1$]{}\n\n$S^1$ is the unit circle:\n\n(-1.2,-1.2)(1.2,1.2) (0,0)(-1.2,-1.2)(1.2,1.2) (1.2,0)[$x$]{}\n(0,1.2)[$y$]{} (0,0)[1]{}\n\n$S^2$ is the unit sphere in the everyday sense of the . It might seem\nlike a strange naming convention to say, for instance, that the\n$2$-sphere is in three-dimensional space. The explanation is that $2$\nrefers to the sphere\u2019s \u201cintrinsic\u201d dimension as a manifold, not the\ndimension to whatever space in which it happens to be immersed.\n\nSometimes this definition is generalized more. In topology we usually\nfail to distinguish homeomorphic spaces, so all homeomorphic images of\n$S^n$ into any topological space are also called $S^n$. It is usually\nclear from context whether $S^n$ denotes the specific unit sphere in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^{n+1}$ or some arbitrary homeomorphic image.",
