  "definition": "The *area* of a two-dimensional figure is the amount of space contained\nwithin the figure. Area is typically measured in ; , if the area of a\nfigure is 5 $\\text{in}^2$, this means that, if five 1 inch by 1 inch\nsquares are cut appropriately, they can be arranged so that they exactly\ncover the space contained in the figure without any overlapping. In\nformulas, area is almost always denoted using the letter $A$.\n\nAll examples provided within this entry are in Euclidean geometry.\n\nFor certain figures, area is quite commonly found by multiplying the\nlengths of two line segments which are related to the figure as well as\nperpendicular to each other. Below are some examples:\n\n-   triangle: $\\displaystyle A=\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is its and $h$\n    is its\n\n    (-1,-2)(5,4) (0,0)(2,4)(5,0)(0,0) (0,0)[.]{} (2,4)[.]{} (5,0)[.]{}\n    (2.5,-0.3)[$b$]{} (2,0)(2,4) (2,2)[$h$]{} (2,0.3)(2.3,0.3)\n    (2.3,0.3)(2.3,0)\n\n-   parallelogram: $A=bh$, where $b$ is its base and $h$ is its height\n\n    (-1,-2)(6,5) (0,0)(1,4)(5,4)(4,0)(0,0) (0,0)[.]{} (1,4)[.]{}\n    (5,4)[.]{} (4,0)[.]{} (2.5,-0.3)[$b$]{} (2,0)(2,4) (2,2)[$h$]{}\n    (2,0.3)(2.3,0.3) (2.3,0.3)(2.3,0) (2,3.7)(2.3,3.7) (2.3,3.7)(2.3,4)\n\n-   : $A=\\pi ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are the major semi-axis and\n    semi-axis (not necessarily respectively)\n\n    (0,0)(6,4) (3,2)(3,2) (0,2)(6,2) (0,2)[.]{} (6,2)[.]{}\n    (2,2.2)[$a$]{} (3,0)(3,4) (3,0)[.]{} (3,4)[.]{} (2.8,3)[$b$]{}\n    (2.7,2)(2.7,2.3) (2.7,2.3)(3,2.3)\n\nAlso, in a , each apothem is perpendicular to a side of the polygon.\nThus, the formula $\\displaystyle A=\\frac{1}{2}aP$, where $a$ is the\nlength of its apothem and $P$ is its , may be considered as another\nexample.\n\nAny three-dimensional figure has a surface which is two-dimensional. For\ncertain figures, such as cubes and cylinders, this fact can easily be\nverified by the surface and it to lie flat. The *surface area* of a\nthree-dimensional figure is the area of its surface.\n\nOne method of determining the surface area of any three-dimensional\nfigure is by investigating how much paint would be required to cover its\nsurface with exactly one coat of paint. (This works best if the paint is\nconsidered to have no thickness.)\n\nThere is another method of determining the surface area of a\nthree-dimensional figure. It works best on figures whose surfaces can\neasily be cut and forced to lie flat. Once this is done, the surface\narea can be obtained by determining the area of the resulting\ntwo-dimensional figure.\n\nFor example, a cube is made up of six squares. If each square has a side\nof length $s$, then the surface area of the cube is $6s^2$.\n\n(-1,-1)(15,7)\n(2,1.5)(0,1.5)(0,3.5)(1.6,4.2)(3.6,4.2)(3.6,2.2)(2,1.5)(2,3.5)(3.6,4.2)\n(0,3.5)(2,3.5) (-0.3,2.5)[$s$]{} (1,1)[cube]{} (4,3)(5.5,3)\n(5.3,3.1)(5.5,3)(5.3,2.9) (6,2)(6,4)(14,4)(14,2) (8,0)(8,6)(10,6)(10,0)\n(12,2)(12,4) (9,6.2)[$s$]{} (14.3,3)[$s$]{} (9,-0.5)[flattened cube]{}\n\nAs another example, for a cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$, its\ntop and bottom, which are circles, can be cut off, and the remaining\nportion can be unrolled as a rectangle. The radius of each circle is\n$r$, so they each have area of $\\pi r^2$. The rectangle has a width that\nis equal to the circumference of the circular faces, and its height is\n$h$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $2\\pi rh$. Therefore, the\nsurface area of the cylinder is $2\\pi r^2+2 \\pi rh$.\n\n(-1,0)(15,11) (0,4)(0,8) (3,4)(3,8) (1.5,8)(1.5,0.5)\n(0,4)(0.15,3.782)(0.3,3.7)(0.45,3.643)(0.6,3.6)(0.75,3.567)(0.9,3.542)(1.05,3.523)(1.2,3.51)(1.35,3.5025)\n(1.5,3.5)(1.65,3.5025)(1.8,3.51)(1.95,3.523)(2.1,3.542)(2.25,3.567)(2.4,3.6)(2.55,3.643)(2.7,3.7)(2.85,3.782)(3,4)\n(-0.3,6)[$h$]{} (1.5,8) (0,8)(1.5,8) (0.75,8.1)[$r$]{}\n(1.5,3)[cylinder]{} (3.3,6)(4.8,6) (4.6,6.1)(4.8,6)(4.6,5.9)\n(5,4)(5,8)(14.425,8)(14.425,4) (14.725,6)[$h$]{} (7,2.5)[1.5]{}\n(7,2.5)(5.5,2.5) (6.25,2.7)[$r$]{} (7,2.5)(7,9.5) (7,9.5)[1.5]{}\n(7,9.5)(5.5,9.5) (6.25,9.7)[$r$]{} (7,11)[.]{} (7,0.5)[flattened\ncylinder]{}\n\nFor some three-dimensional figures, determining its surface area in this\nmanner may not be very straightforward. For example, to determine the\nsurface area of a sphere, one could try peeling an orange and making the\nportions of orange peel lie flat, but it would be very difficult to come\nup with the correct formula of $4\\pi r^2$ from this procedure. The\nmethod of painting as described earlier works much better for spheres.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   When the shape of the geometric figure is complicated, the area can\n    be computed using techniques from calculus. The idea is to break up\n    the geometric figure into tiny squares. The area of the figure may\n    be approximated by the total area occupied by these squares. The\n    interesting thing is whether it is possible to get an exact answer\n    if the squares are tiny enough. For all of the examples given above,\n    using the tiny squares will give the exact answer.\n\n-   The concept of area is a special case of a general concept called\n    measure, or more appropriately, product measure.",
