  "definition": "The [*radian*]{} is a of angle used in the higher mathematics. The\nmagnitude of an angle $\\alpha$ is one radian, if the arc corresponding\nthe angle $\\alpha$ as a central angle of a circle is equally long as the\nradius of the circle. Thus, a radian is equal to $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$ ,\nminutes and seconds approximately $57^{\\mathrm{o}}\\,17'\\,44.80625''.$\n\nIn degrees, a circle has 360 degrees, while in radians a circle has\n$2\\pi$ radians. In fact, many angles of equilateral polygons are equal\nto a multiple of $\\pi$ divided by some integer: for example, the\ninterior angle of an equilateral triangle\u2019s vertex is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$,\nwhile the interior angle of an equilateral pentagon\u2019s vertex is\n$\\frac{3\\pi}{5}$.",
