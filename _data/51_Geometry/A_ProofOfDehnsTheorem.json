Given any edge $e$\nof a piece $P_k$ the following cases arise:\n\n1.  $e$ is contained in the interior of $P$. Since an entire\n    neighbourhood of $e$ is contained in $P$ the angles of the pieces\n    which have $e$ as an edge (or part of an edge) must have sum $2\\pi$.\n    So in the right hand side of\u00a0 the edge $e$ gives a contribution of\n    $f(2\\pi)\\ell(e)$ (recall that $f$ is additive).\n\n2.  $e$ is contained in a facet of $P$. The same argument as before is\n    valid, only we find that the total contribution is $f(\\pi)\\ell(e)$.\n\n3.  $e$ is contained in an edge $e'$ of $P$. In this case the total\n    contribution given by $e$ to the right hand side of\u00a0 is given by\n    $f(\\theta_{e'})\\ell(e)$.\n\nSince we have choosen $f$ so that $f(\\pi)=0$ and hence also $f(2\\pi)=0$\n(since $f$ is additive) we conclude that the equivalence\u00a0 is valid.\n\nNow we are able to prove Dehn\u2019s Theorem. Choose $T$ to be a regular\ntetrahedron with edges of length $1$. Then $D(T)=6 f(\\theta)$ where\n$\\theta$ is the angle between two faces of $T$. We know that\n$\\theta/\\pi$ is irrational, hence there exists an additive function $f$\nsuch that $f(\\theta)=1$ while $f(\\pi/2)=0$ (as there exist additive\nfunctions which are not linear).\n\nSo if $P$ is any parallelepiped we find that $D(P)=0$ (since each angle\nbetween facets of $P$ is $\\pi/2$ and $f(\\pi/2)=0$) while $D(T)=6$. This\nmeans that $P$ and $T$ cannot be scissor-equivalent.",
