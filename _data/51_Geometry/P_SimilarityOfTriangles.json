  "statement": "The following theorems are valid in Euclidean geometry:\n\n**Theorem AA.** If one triangle has a pair of angles that are congruent\nto a pair of angles in another triangle, then the two triangles are\nsimilar.\n\n**Theorem .** If a pair of sides of a triangle are proportional to a\npair of sides in another triangle and if the angles included by the\nside-pairs are congruent, then the triangles are similar.\n\n**Theorem .** If the sides of a triangle are proportional to the sides\nof another triangle, then the triangles are similar.\\\nThe AA theorem may be regarded as the definition of the similarity of\ntriangles. In some texts, the AA theorem is assumed as a postulate. The\nother two theorems may be proved by using the law of cosines for\ndetermining the the ratios other sides (for ) and the angles.\n\nIn hyperbolic geometry and spherical geometry, similar triangles are\ncongruent. (See the AAA theorem for more details.) Thus, the theorem and\ntheorem are invalid in these .",
