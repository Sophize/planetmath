  "definition": "A [*complete crossed quadrilateral*]{} is formed by four distinct lines\n$AC$, $AD$, $CF$ and $DE$ in the Euclidean plane, each of which\nintersects the other three. The intersection of $CF$ and $DE$ is\nlabelled as $B$. A complete crossed quadrilateral has six vertices, of\nwhich $A$ and $B$, $C$ and $D$, $E$ and $F$ are opposite.\n\n(-3,-2.2)(3,2.1) (-3,-2)(0,-2) (-3,-2)(-1,0) (0,-2)(2,-2)(-1,0)(1,2)\n(-3,-2)(2,-2)(1,2)(0,-2)(-1,0)(0.2857143,-0.857143) (-3,-2.2)[$A$]{}\n(0,-2.2)[$E$]{} (2,-2.2)[$C$]{} (-1.1,0)[$F$]{} (1,2.1)[$D$]{}\n(0.4,-0.657143)[$B$]{}\n\nThe complete crossed quadrilateral is often to the [*crossed\nquadrilateral*]{} $CEDF$ (cyan in the diagram), consisting of the four\nline segments $CE$, $CF$, $DE$ and $DF$. Its diagonals $CD$ and $EF$ are\noutside of the crossed quadrilateral. In the picture below, the same\nquadrilateral as above is still in cyan, and its diagonals are drawn in\nblue.\n\n(-1,-2.2)(3,2.1) (0,-2)(2,-2)(-1,0)(1,2) (0,-2)(-1,0) (2,-2)(1,2)\n(2,-2)(1,2)(0,-2)(-1,0) (0,-2.2)[$E$]{} (2,-2.2)[$C$]{} (-1.1,0)[$F$]{}\n(1,2.1)[$D$]{}\n\nThe sum of the inner angles of $CEDF$ is $720^{\\mathrm{o}}$. Its area is\nobtained by of the Bretschneider\u2019s formula (cf. area of a\nquadrilateral).\n\nA special case of the crossed quadrilateral is the\n[*antiparallelogram*]{}, in which the lengths of the opposite sides $CE$\nand $DF$ are equal; similarly, the lengths of the opposite sides $CF$\nand $DE$ are equal. Below, an antiparallelogram $CEDF$ is drawn in red.\nThe antiparallelogram is with respect to the perpendicular bisector of\nthe diagonal $CD$ (which is also the perpendicular bisector of the\ndiagonal $EF$). When the lengths of the sides $CE$, $CF$, $DE$, and $DF$\nare fixed, the product of the both diagonals $CD$ and $EF$ (yellow in\nthe diagram) has a value, of the inner angles (e.g. on $\\alpha$).\n\n(0,-1)(6,3) (0,0)(5,2.5)(6,0)(1,2.5) (-0.1,-0.3)[$C$]{}\n(6.15,-0.3)[$D$]{} (5.0,2.6)[$F$]{} (1.0,2.6)[$E$]{}\n(3.4,1.39)[$\\alpha$]{} (0,0)(6,0) (1,2.5)(5,2.5)\n(0,0)(6,0)(1,2.5)(5,2.5)",
