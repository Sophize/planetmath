  "definition": "Let $PG(V)$ and $PG(W)$ be projective geometries, with $V,W$ vector\nspaces over a field $K$. A function $p$ from $PG(V)$ to $PG(W)$ is\ncalled a *projective transformation*, or simply a *projectivity* if\n\n1.  $p$ is a bijection, and\n\n2.  $p$ is order preserving.\n\nA *projective property* is any geometric property, such as incidence,\nlinearity, etc... that is preserved under a projectivity.\n\nFrom the definition, we see that a projectivity $p$ carries 0 to 0, $V$\nto $W$. Furthermore, it carries points to points, lines to lines, planes\nto planes, etc.. In short, $p$ preserves linearity. Because $p$ is a\nbijection, $p$ also preserves dimensions, that is $\\dim(S)=\\dim(p(S))$,\nfor any subspace $S$ of $V$. In particular, $\\dim(V)=\\dim(W)$. Other\nproperties preserved by $p$ are incidence: if $S\\cap T\\ne\\varnothing$,\nthen $p(S)\\cap p(T)\\neq \\varnothing$; and .\n\nEvery bijective semilinear transformation defines a projectiviity. To\nsee this, let $f:V\\to W$ be a semilinear transformation. If $S$ is a\nsubspace of $V$, then $f(S)$ is a subspace of $W$, as $x,y\\in f(S)$,\nthen $x+y=f(a)+f(b)=f(a+b)\\in f(S)$, and\n$\\alpha x={\\beta}^{\\theta}x={\\beta}^{\\theta}f(a)=f(\\beta a)\\in f(S)$,\nwhere $\\theta$ is an automorphism of the common underlying field $K$.\nAlso, if $S$ is a subspace of a subspace $T$ of $V$, then $f(S)$ is a\nsubspace of $f(T)$. Now if we define $f^*:PG(V)\\to PG(W)$ by\n$f^*(S)=f(S)$, it is easy to see that $f^*$ is a projectivity.\n\nConversely, if $V$ and $W$ are of finite dimension greater than $2$,\nthen a projectivity $p:PG(V)\\to PG(W)$ induces a semilinear\ntransformation $\\hat{p}:V\\to W$. This highly non-trivial fact is the\n(first) fundamental theorem of projective geometry.\n\nIf the semilinear transformation induced by the projectivity $p$ is in\nfact a linear transformation, then $p$ is a [*collineation*]{}: three\ndistinct collinear points are mapped to three distinct collinear points.\n\n**Remark**. The definition given in this entry is a generalization of\nthe definition typically given for a projective transformation. In the\nmore restictive definition, a projectivity $p$ is defined merely as a\nbijection between two projective spaces that is induced by a linear\nisomorphism. More precisely, if $P(V)$ and $P(W)$ are projective spaces\ninduced by the vector spaces $V$ and $W$, if $L:V\\to W$ is a bijective\nlinear transformation, then $p=P(L):P(V)\\to P(W)$ defined by\n$$P(L)[v]=[Lv]$$ is the corresponding projective transformation. $[v]$\nis the homogeneous coordinate representation of $v$. In this definition,\na projectiity is always a collineation. In the case where the vector\nspaces are finite dimensional with specified bases, $p$ is expressible\nin terms of an invertible matrix ($Lv=Av$ where $A$ is an invertible\nmatrix).",
