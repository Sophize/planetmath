  "definition": "An *antiprism* is a prismatoid whose bases are congruent and whose\nlateral faces are congruent triangles.\n\nAn antiprism can be used to construct an icosahedron: Let $A$ be an\nantiprism with regular pentagons as its bases and equilateral triangles\nas its lateral faces. To each base of $A$, attach a pentagonal pyramid\nwhose base is congruent to the bases of $A$ and whose lateral faces are\nequilateral triangles.\n\nFor any integer $n \\ge 3$, the following are equivalent statements about\nan antiprism $A$:\n\n1.  $A$ has a base that is an $n$-gon;\n\n2.  $A$ has $2n+2$ faces;\n\n3.  $A$ has $2n$ vertices;\n\n4.  $A$ has $4n$ edges.",
