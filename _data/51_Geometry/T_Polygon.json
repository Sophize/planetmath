  "definition": "Definitions\n===========\n\nWe follow Forder [@forder] for most of this entry. The term polygon can\nbe defined if one has a definition of an interval. For this entry we use\nbetweenness geometry. A betweenness geometry is just one for which there\nis a set of points and a betweenness relation $B$ defined. Rather than\nwrite $(a,b,c) \\in B$ we write $a*b*c$.\n\n1.  If $a$ and $b$ are distinct points, the *line $ab$* is the set of\n    all points $p$ such that $p*a*b$ or $a*p*b$ or $a*b*p$. It can be\n    shown that the line $ab$ and the line $ba$ are the same set of\n    points.\n\n2.  If $o$ and $a$ are distinct points, a *ray $[oa$* is the set of all\n    points $p$ such that $p=o$ or $o*p*a$ or $o*a*p$.\n\n3.  If $a$ and $b$ are distinct points, the *open interval* is the set\n    of points $p$ such that $a*p*b$. It is denoted by $(a,b).$\n\n4.  If $a$ and $b$ are distinct points, the *closed interval* is\n    $(a,b) \\cup \\{a\\} \\cup \\{b\\}$, and denoted by $[a,b].$\n\n5.  The *way $a_1a_2\\ldots a_n$* is the finite set of points\n    $\\{a_1, \\ldots , a_n\\}$ along with the open intervals\n    $(a_1, a_2), (a_2,a_3), \\ldots, (a_{n-1}, a_n)$. The points\n    $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ are called the *vertices* of the way, and the\n    open intervals are called the *sides* of the way. A way is also\n    called a *broken line*. The closed intervals\n    $[a_1,a_2], \\ldots, [a_{n-1},a_n]$ are called the *side-intervals*\n    of the way. The lines $a_1a_2, \\ldots , a_{n-1}a_n$ are called the\n    *side-lines* of the way. The way $a_1a_2\\ldots a_n$ is said to\n    *join* $a_1$ to $a_n$. It is assumed that $a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1}$\n    are not collinear.\n\n6.  A way is said to be *simple* if it does not meet itself. To be\n    precise, (i) no two side-intervals meet in any point which is not a\n    vertex, and (ii) no three side-intervals meet in any point.\n\n7.  A *polygon* is a way $a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n$ for which $a_1 = a_n$.\n    Notice that there is no assumption that the points are coplanar.\n\n8.  A *simple polygon* is polygon for which the way is simple.\n\n9.  A *region* is a set of points not all collinear, any two of which\n    can be joined by points of a way using only points of the region.\n\n10. A region $R$ is *convex* if for each pair of points $a,b \\in R$ the\n    open interval $(a,b)$ is contained in $R.$\n\n11. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two sets of points. If there is a set of points\n    $S$ such that every way joining a point of $X$ to a point of $Y$\n    meets $S$ then $S$ is said to *separate* $X$ from $Y$.\n\n12. If $a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n$ is a polygon, then the *angles of the\n    polygon* are $\\angle a_na_1a_2, \\angle a_1a_2a_3$, and so on.\n\nNow assume that all points of the geometry are in one plane. Let $P$ be\na polygon. ($P$ is called a *plane polygon*.)\n\n1.  A ray or line which does not go through a vertex of $P$ will be\n    called *suitable*.\n\n2.  An *inside point* $a$ of $P$ is one for which a suitable ray from\n    $a$ meets $P$ an odd number of times. Points that are not on or\n    inside $P$ are said to be *outside* $P$.\n\n3.  Let $\\{P_i\\}$ be a set of polygons. We say that $\\{P_i\\}$ *dissect*\n    $P$ if the following three conditions are satisfied: (i) $P_i$ and\n    $P_j$ do not have a common inside point for $i \\not = j$, (ii) each\n    inside point of $P$ is inside or on some $P_i$ and (iii) each inside\n    point of $P_i$ is inside $P$.\n\n4.  A *convex polygon* is one whose inside points are all on the same\n    side of any side-line of the polygon.\n\nTheorems\n========\n\nAssume that all points are in one plane. Let $P$ be a polygon.\n\n1.  It can be shown that $P$ separates the other points of the plane\n    into at least two regions and that if $P$ is simple there are\n    exactly two regions. Moise proves this directly in [@moise], pp.\n    16-18.\n\n2.  It can be shown that $P$ can be dissected into triangles $\\{T_i\\}$\n    such that every vertex of a $T_i$ is a vertex of $P$.\n\n3.  The following theorem of Euler can be shown: Suppose $P$ is\n    dissected into $f>1$ polygons and that the total number of vertices\n    of these polygons is $v$, and the number of open intervals which are\n    sides is $e$. Then $$v-e+f = 1$$.\n\nA plane simple polygon with $n$ sides is called an $n$-gon, although for\nsmall $n$ there are more traditional names:\n\n   Number of sides   Name of the polygon\n  ----------------- ---------------------\n          3               triangle\n          4             quadrilateral\n          5               pentagon\n          6                hexagon\n          7               heptagon\n          8                octagon\n         10                decagon\n\nA plane simple polygon is also called a *Jordan polygon*.\n\n[9]{} K.
