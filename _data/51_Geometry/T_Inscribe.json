  "definition": "To *inscribe* a polygon (such as a triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) or\ncircle is to enclose it in another polygon or circle so that the\nvertices of the polygon are on the circumference of the circle or sides\nof the outer polygon, or so that the circumference of the inner circle\ntouches the sides of the enclosing polygon. In the specific case of a\npolygon inside of a circle, this is called to circumscribe.\n\nNow, a couple of examples: First, a circle inscribed in a pentagon.\n\n![image](CircleInPentagon)\n\nNext, another example of a pentagon, but inscribed with a triangle this\ntime.\n\n![image](TriangleInPentagon)",
