  "definition": "Two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the circumference of a circle (or on a\nsphere) are [*diametral*]{}, if the line segment $P_1P_2$ connecting\nthem passes through the centre of the circle (resp. the sphere), i.e. is\na . Equivalently, the shortest distance of the diametral points $P_1$\nand $P_2$ on the circle is maximal on the circle (resp. on the sphere),\nnamely a half of the .\n\nIt\u2019s easily justified that a point of a circle (resp. a sphere) has\nexactly one diametral point.\\\nA circle $c$ is a [*diametral circle*]{} of a given circle $c_0$, if $c$\nintersects $c_0$ [*diametrically*]{}, i.e. in two diametral points of\n$c_0$.\n\nIf the equation of $c_0$ is $(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2 = r^2$ and $(a,\\,b)$ is\ninside $c_0$, then the equation of the diametral circle $c$ with centre\n$(a,\\,b)$ is given by $$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 = r^2-(x_0-a)^2-(y_0-b)^2.$$",
