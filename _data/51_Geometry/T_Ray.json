  "definition": "**Rays on the real line**. A *ray* on the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is just\nan open set of the form $(p,\\infty)$, or $(-\\infty,p)$. A ray is also\ncalled a *half line*, or an *open ray*, to distinguish the notion of a\n*closed ray*, which includes its endpoint.\n\n**Properties** Suppose $p,q\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $p\\le q$.\n\n-   $(p,\\infty)\\cap(q,\\infty)=(q,\\infty)$.\n\n-   $(p,\\infty)\\cup(q,\\infty)=(p,\\infty)$.\n\n-   $(p,\\infty)\\cap(-\\infty,q)=(p,q)$ if $p\\ne q$, and $\\varnothing$ if\n    $p=q$.\n\n-   $(-\\infty,p)\\cap(q,\\infty)=\\varnothing$.\n\n-   $(p,\\infty)\\cup(-\\infty,q)=\\mathbb{R}$ if $p\\ne q$, and\n    $\\mathbb{R}-\\lbrace p\\rbrace$ if $p=q$.\n\n-   $(-\\infty,p)\\cup(q,\\infty)=\\mathbb{R}-[p,q]$ if $p\\ne q$, and\n    $\\mathbb{R}-\\lbrace p\\rbrace$ if $p=q$.\n\n**Rays in a general Euclidean space**. Let $\\ell$ be a line in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $p$ be a point lying on the $\\ell$. We may\nparameterize $\\ell=\\ell(t)$ (parameter $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$) so that\n$\\ell(0)=p$. An (*open*) *ray* $\\rho$ lying on $\\ell$ with *endpoint*\n$p$ is the set of points $$\\rho=\\lbrace r\\mid r=\\ell(t), t>0 \\rbrace.$$\nIf the inequality $t>0$ is relaxed to $t\\ge 0$ in the above expression,\nthen we have a *closed ray*. Note that if the inequality above were\nchanged to $t<0$ instead, we end up again with a ray lying on $\\ell$ and\nendpoint $p$. It is a ray because we can reparameterize $\\ell$ by using\nthe parameter $s=-t$ instead, so that\n$$\\lbrace r\\mid r=\\ell(t), t<0\\rbrace = \\lbrace r \\mid r=\\ell(s),s>0\\rbrace.$$\nThe difference between the two rays is that they point in the opposite\ndirections. Therefore, in general, a ray can be characterized by\n\n-   a line,\n\n-   a point lying on the line, and\n\n-   a direction on the line.\n\n**Rays in an ordered geometry**: Given two distinct points $p,q$ in an\nordered geometry $(A,B)$ ($A$ is the underlying and $B$ is the strict\nbetweenness relation defined on the points of $A$). The set\n$$\\overline{pq}\\cup\\lbrace q\\rbrace\\cup\\lbrace r\\mid q\\in\\overline{pr} \\rbrace,$$\nwhere $\\overline{st}$ denotes the open line segment with endpoints $s$\nand $t$, is called the *(open) ray generated by* $p$ and $q$ emanating\nfrom $p$. It is denoted by ${\\overrightarrow{pq}}$. $p$ in\n${\\overrightarrow{pq}}$ is called the *source* or the *end point* of the\nray. A *closed ray generated by* $p$ and $q$ with endpoint $p$ is the\nset ${\\overrightarrow{pq}}\\cup\\lbrace p\\rbrace$.\n\n**Properties.**\n\n-   for any point $r\\in{\\overrightarrow{pq}}$,\n    ${\\overrightarrow{pr}}={\\overrightarrow{pq}}$.\n\n-   ${\\overrightarrow{pq}}\\cup{\\overrightarrow{qp}}={\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$\n    and ${\\overrightarrow{pq}}\\cap{\\overrightarrow{qp}}=\\overline{pq}$.\n    We say that a ray lies on a line if all of the points in the ray are\n    incident with the line. Also, a line segment lies on a ray if it is\n    a subset of the ray.\n\n-   The *opposite ray* of $\\rho={\\overrightarrow{pq}}$ is defined to be\n    $${\\overrightarrow{qp}}-\\overline{pq}-\\lbrace q\\rbrace.$$ It is\n    denoted by $-\\rho$.\n\n-   The opposite ray $-\\rho$ of a ray $\\rho$ is ray. Suppose\n    $\\rho={\\overrightarrow{pq}}$. Then $\\rho$ has the property that\n\n    1.  $\\rho\\cap(-\\rho)=\\varnothing$ and\n\n    2.  $\\rho\\cup(-\\rho)={\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}-\\lbrace p\\rbrace$.\n\n    Conversely, given a ray $\\rho={\\overrightarrow{pq}}$, any ray\n    $\\rho^{\\prime}$ satisfying the above two properties (replacing\n    $-\\rho$ by $\\rho^{\\prime}$) is the opposite ray of $\\rho$.\n\n-   Given any point $p$ on a line $\\ell$, there are exactly two rays\n    lying on $\\ell$ with endpoint $p$. Furthermore, $p$ is between $q$\n    and $r$ in $\\ell$ iff $q$ and $r$ lie on opposite rays on $\\ell$.\n\n-   Given any two rays $\\rho$ and $\\varrho$, exactly one of the\n    following holds:\n\n    1.  $\\rho\\cap\\varrho=\\varnothing$,\n\n    2.  $\\rho\\cap\\varrho=$ a line segment, or\n\n    3.  $\\rho\\cap\\varrho=$ a ray.\n\n    It is not hard to see that in the last case, one ray is included in\n    the other, and their intersection is the \u201csmaller\u201d of the two rays.\n    In the first two cases, the two rays are said to be (pointing) in\n    the opposite direction. In the last case, the two are said to be in\n    the same direction. Opposite rays are clearly pointing in the\n    opposite direction.\n\n-   An equivalence relation can be defined on the set of all rays lying\n    on a line $\\ell$ by whether they are pointing in the same direction\n    or not. Thus, the set of all rays lying on $\\ell$ can be partitioned\n    into two subsets $R$ and $R^{\\prime}$, so that if\n    $\\rho,\\varrho\\in R$ (or $R^{\\prime}$), then they are pointing in the\n    same direction; and if $\\rho\\in R$ and $\\varrho\\in R^{\\prime}$ are\n    pointing in the opposite direction.\n\n-   Pick one of the two subsets from above, say $R$. Define $\\le$ on $R$\n    by $\\rho\\le\\varrho$ if $\\rho\\subseteq\\varrho$. Then $\\le$ is a\n    linear order on $R$. This $\\le$ induces a linear order $\\le_{\\ell}$\n    on the line $\\ell$ in the following way: $p\\le_{\\ell}q$ if the\n    corresponding rays $\\rho,\\varrho\\in R$, with endpoints $p$ and $q$\n    respectively, we have $\\rho\\le\\varrho$. This is one way to define a\n    linear ordering on a line $\\ell$. An alternative, but equivalent way\n    of defining a linear ordering on a line in an ordered geometry can\n    be found in the entry under ordered geometry.\n\n-   Note that in defining $\\le$, we could have used $R^{\\prime}$ instead\n    of $R$. This is an example of the duality of linear ordering.\n\n[6]{} D. Hilbert, [*Foundations of Geometry*]{}, Open Court Publishing\nCo. (1971) K. Borsuk and W.
