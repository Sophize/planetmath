  "definition": "Two angles are called [*complementary angles*]{} of each other, if their\nsum is the right angle $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, i.e. $90^\\circ$.\n\nFor example, the acute angles of a right triangle are complement angles\nof each other, since the angle sum in any triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n\nThe sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of the complement angle, and\nvice versa.\n\nThe tangent of an angle equals to the cotangent of the complement angle,\nand vice versa (provided that no one of the angles is a multiple of the\nstraight angle).",
