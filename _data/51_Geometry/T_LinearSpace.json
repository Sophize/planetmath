  "definition": "A [**]{} is a near-linear space $\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$\nin which every pair of distinct points are on exactly one line.\n\nNote: The usage of the term has little relation to its occasional\nappearance in linear algebra as a synonym for a vector space.\n\nNote: The convention for drawing finite linear spaces is to ignore\ntwo-point lines. Thus, a linear space with three points and three lines\nis drawn\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (-1,0) (1,0)\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,0.5)[rather than]{}\n\n(-1,0)(1,1) (0,1) (-1,0) (1,0) (-1,0)(1,0) (0,1)(1,0) (0,1)(-1,0)\n\n#### Examples:\n\n1.  We have seen in the parent entry that a graph can be thought of as a\n    near-linear space in which every line contains two points. A\n    complete graph is then a linear space.\n\n2.  Let $\\mathbb{F}$ be a finite field. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the\n    elements in the Cartesian product $\\mathbb{F}\\times \\mathbb{F}$. The\n    solutions to a linear equation\n    $$\\{ (x,y)\\in\\mathcal{P} \\mid ax+by =c\\}$$ for some\n    $a, b, c\\in \\mathbb{F}$, where $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, form a\n    line in $\\mathcal{L}$. Since any two points determine a unique line,\n    $\\mathscr{A} = (\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$ is a linear space, called\n    the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}$.\n\n3.  Any projective plane is a linear space. Conversely, any linear space\n    in which every two lines meet, and there exists a quadrangle is a\n    projective plane.\n\n4.  A *near-pencil* is a finite linear space with the following diagram:\n\n    (-3,-1)(3,1.5) (0,1.5) (-3,0) (-1.5,0) (1.5,0) (3,0) (-3,0)(3,0)\n    (-3,0)[$P_1$]{} (-1.5,0)[$P_2$]{} (0,0)[$\\cdots$]{}\n    (1.5,0)[$P_{n-1}$]{} (3,0)[$P_n$]{} (0.25,1.5)[$P$]{}\n    (3.5,0)[$\\ell$]{}\n\n    In other words, a near-pencil consists of $n+1$ points and $n+1$\n    lines, where $n\\ge 2$, such that $n$ points lie on one line $\\ell$,\n    and the remaining point $P$ lies on $n$ 2-point lines. Of course, on\n    any 2-point line, the point other than $P$ must be on $\\ell$.\n\n    A fundamental fact concerning finite linear space is the De Bruijn\n    Erd\u0151s theorem, which states that given a finite linear space\n    $\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$ with at least two lines,\n    then $|\\mathcal{P}|\\le |\\mathcal{L}|$, and if the equality occurs,\n    then $\\mathscr{S}$ is either a projective plane or a near-pencil.\n\n5.  Let $k_1,\\ldots,k_n$ be positive integers greater than 2. A\n    *$(k_1,\\ldots,k_n)$-star* is a linear space such that there are $n$\n    lines of sizes $k_1,\\ldots, k_n$ respectively, which are concurrent,\n    and all other lines are 2-point lines. By convention, we order the\n    integers so that $k_1\\le \\cdots \\le k_n$. When $n=2$, we call the\n    space a $(k_1,k_2)$-cross. Below are diagrams of a $(3,3,3,3)$-star\n    and a $(4,5)$-cross:\n\n    (-1,-1)(1,1) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (0,-1) (0,1) (-0.7,-0.7) (0.7,0.7)\n    (-0.7,0.7) (0.7,-0.7) (-1,0)(1,0) (0,-1)(0,1) (-0.7,-0.7)(0.7,0.7)\n    (-0.7,0.7)(0.7,-0.7)\n\n    (-2,-1)(2,1) (-2,0) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (-1,-0.5) (1,0.5) (2,1)\n    (-2,0)(2,0) (-1,-0.5)(2,1)\n\n6.  There are five non-isomorphic five-point linear spaces:\n\n    (-2,-1)(2,1.5) (-2,0) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (-2,0)(2,0)\n\n    (-1.25,-1)(1.25,1.5) (-1.5,0) (-0.5,0) (0,1) (0.5,0) (1.5,0)\n    (-1.5,0)(1.5,0)\n\n    (-1.5,-1)(1.5,1.5) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (0,0.5) (1,1) (-1,0)(1,0)\n    (-1,0)(1,1)\n\n    (-1,-1)(1,1.5) (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0) (-0.5,1) (0.5,1) (-1,0)(1,0)\n\n    (-1.25,-1)(1.25,1.5) (-0.6,0) (0.6,0) (-1.15,0.8) (1.15,0.8) (0,1.5)\n\n    Corresponding to the diagrams above, the spaces have respectively 1,\n    5, 6, 8, and 10 lines. Of these, the second is a near-pencil, the\n    third is a $(3,3)$-cross, and the last is a complete graph.\n\n#### Some properties:\n\n1.  In a linear space $\\mathscr{S}=(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{L})$,\n    $$\\sum_{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}} \\binom{|\\ell|}{2} = \\binom{|\\mathcal{P}|}{2}.$$\n\n2.  Let $p$ be an arbitrary point in a linear space,\n    $$\\sum_{\\ell \\ni p} (|\\ell| - 1) = |\\mathcal{P}| - 1$$ where the sum\n    is taken over all lines containing $p$. This holds because given any\n    point, this point forms exactly one line with every other point, so\n    $|\\ell| - 1$ counts the number of points $p$ shares in line $\\ell$.\n    Summing over all lines gives all the points except $p$.\n\n[7]{} L.
