  "definition": "[*Circle line picking*]{} is the activity of choosing two points on the\ncircumference a unit circle and calculating probabilities and averages\nabout the chord formed by connecting those two points.\n\nThe length of the line segment between the two points is\n$\\sqrt{2 - 2\\cos\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of the central\nvertex of a triangle formed by connecting the two points to the center.\nOn average, this works out to $\\frac{4}{\\pi}$.",
