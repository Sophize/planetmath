  "definition": "An *endpoint* of a line segment $L$ is a point that belongs to the\nboundary of $L$. Note that every line segment has two distinct\nendpoints. For example, if $V$ is a vector space and $a,b \\in V$ with\n$b \\neq 0$, then the endpoints of the line segment\n$\\displaystyle L = \\{ a+tb : t\\in[0,1]\\}$ are $a$ and $a+b$.\n\n(0,-0.5)(4,0.1) (0,0.06)[.]{} (0,0)(4,0) (0,0)(4,0) (0,-0.3)[$a$]{}\n(4,-0.3)[$a+b$]{}\n\nNote that the endpoints of the open line segment\n$\\displaystyle L=\\{a+tb:t\\in(0,1)\\}$ are also $a$ and $a+b$.\n\n(0,-0.5)(4,0.1) (0,0.06)[.]{} (0,0)(4,0) (0,-0.3)[$a$]{}\n(4,-0.3)[$a+b$]{}\n\nEndpoints can be defined in a manner for other geometric .
