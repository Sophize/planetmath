  "statement": "Let $P\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^2$ be a polygon with all vertices on lattice\npoints on the grid ${\\mathbb{Z}}^2$. Let $I$ be the number of lattice\npoints that lie *inside* $P$, and let $O$ be the number of lattice\npoints that lie on the boundary of $P$. Then the area of $P$ is\n$$A(P) = I + \\frac{1}{2}O - 1.$$\n\n![image](pick)\n\nIn the above example, we have $I=5$ and $O=13$, so the area is\n$A=10\\frac{1}{2}$; inspection shows this is true.",
