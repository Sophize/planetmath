  "definition": "Let $S$ be a linear ordered geometry. Fix a point $p$ and consider the\npencil $\\Pi(p)$ of all rays emanating from it. Let\n$\\alpha\\neq\\beta \\in\\Pi(p)$. A point $q$ is said to be an *interior\npoint* of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ if there are points $s\\in\\alpha$ and\n$t\\in\\beta$ such that\n\n1.  $q$ and $s$ are on the same side of line\n    ${\\overleftrightarrow{pt}}$, and\n\n2.  $q$ and $t$ are on the same side of line\n    ${\\overleftrightarrow{ps}}$.\n\nA point $q$ is said to be *between* $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ if there are\npoints $s\\in\\alpha$ and $t\\in\\beta$ such that $q$ is between $s$ and\n$t$. A point that is between two rays is an interior point of these\nrays, but not vice versa in general. A ray $\\rho\\in\\Pi(p)$ is said to be\n*between* rays $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ if there is an interior point of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ lying on $\\rho$.\\\n\\\n**Properties**\n\n1.  Suppose $\\alpha,\\beta,\\rho\\in\\Pi(p)$ and $\\rho$ is between $\\alpha$\n    and $\\beta$. Then\n\n    1.  any point on $\\rho$ is an interior point of $\\alpha$ and\n        $\\beta$;\n\n    2.  any point on the line containing $\\rho$ that is an interior\n        point of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must be a point on $\\rho$;\n\n    3.  there is a point $q$ on $\\rho$ that is between $\\alpha$ and\n        $\\beta$. This is known as the **Crossbar Theorem**, the two\n        \u201ccrossbars\u201d being $\\rho$ and a line segment joining a point on\n        $\\alpha$ and a point on $\\beta$;\n\n    4.  if $q$ is defined as above, then any point between $p$ and $q$\n        is between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\n2.  There are no rays between two opposite rays.\n\n3.  If $\\rho$ is between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, then $\\beta$ is not\n    between $\\alpha$ and $\\rho$.\n\n4.  If $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Pi(p)$ has a ray $\\rho$ between them, then\n    $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must lie on the same half plane of some line.\n\n5.  The converse of the above statement is true too: if\n    $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Pi(p)$ are distinct rays that are not opposite of\n    one another, then there exist a ray $\\rho\\in\\Pi(p)$ such that $\\rho$\n    is between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\n6.  Given $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Pi(p)$ with $\\alpha\\neq\\beta$ and\n    $\\alpha\\neq-\\beta$. We can write $\\Pi(p)$ as a disjoint union of two\n    subsets:\n\n    1.  $A =\\lbrace \\rho\\in\\Pi(p)\\mid\n        \\rho\\mbox{ is between }\\alpha\\mbox{ and }\\beta\\rbrace$,\n\n    2.  $B=\\Pi(p)-A$.\n\n    Let $\\rho,\\sigma\\in\\Pi(p)$ be two rays distinct from both $\\alpha$\n    and $\\beta$. Suppose $x\\in\\rho$ and $y\\in\\sigma$. Then $\\rho,\\sigma$\n    belong to the same subset if and only if $\\overline{xy}$ does not\n    intersect either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$.\n\n[6]{} D.
