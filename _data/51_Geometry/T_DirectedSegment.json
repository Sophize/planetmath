  "definition": "Let $AB$ a line segment. The directed segment $\\overline{AB}$ is to be\ntaken the segment $AB$ with a direction (similar to vectors). The\ndefining property is then $$\\overline{AB}=-\\overline{BA},$$ (which\nrelates to the property of vectors stating that $v$ and $-v$ have\nopposite direction and same modulus).\n\nThe addition of directed segments is done in a similar fashion of\nvectors, so the above relation is equivalent to\n$$\\overline{AB} + \\overline{BA} = 0.$$ where $0$ represents any segment\nof the form $\\overline{PP}$. If it is stated that we will work with\ndirected segments, it\u2019s customary to omit the overlining and to just\nwrite $AB$, convention we will follow now.\n\n**Notes.**\n\n-   The definition does not says $AB$ is either positive or negative\n    (and it does not really matters doing so). It merely states that\n    traveling the segment on different directions give different signs.\n\n-   It does not make sense to compare signs of non-collinear segments.\n    So if $A,B,C$ are not on the same line (or parallel lines) we cannot\n    relate the signs of $AB,BC$ and $CA$.\n\nIt can be proved considering cases that no matter the relative position\nof three points $A,B,C$ on a line, the following equality holds:\n$$AB + BC = AC.$$\n\n(-4,-1)(4,2) (-3,0)(-1,0) (-1,0)(3,0) (-3,0)[$B$]{} (-1,0)[$A$]{}\n(3,0)[$P$]{} (-1,0.5)(3,0.5)(3,1)(-3,1)\n\nIn the above picture $AP+PB=AB$. Notice that $AB$ goes to the left since\n$AB$ is the segment that starts at $A$ and ends at $B$. Also, taking\n$A=C$ gives $AB+BA = AA = 0$ which is consistent with the earlier\nremarks.\n\nJust like undirected segments in Euclidean geometry (and unlike\nvectors), directed segments can be divided to obtain a ratio. Such ratio\nis the number obtained dividing the undirected segments, but taking\nsigns int oaccount (ratio of two segments with the same direction is\npositive, and negative otherwise).\n\nGiven two points $A,B$ on a line, we can locate any other point $P$ on\nthe line considering the ratio $AP/PB$. In other words, $P=Q$ if and\nonly if $AP/PB = AQ/QB$. Moreover, to each point $P$ corresponds an\nextended [^1] real $r=AP/PB$ and to each extended real $r$ corresponds a\npoint $P$ such that $r=AP/PB$.\n\nNotice that $AP/PB$ is positive when $AP$ and $PB$ have the same\ndirection, which happens if and only if $p$ is between $A$ and $B$. If\n$P$ lies outside $AP$, then $AP$ and $PB$ have negative signs and so the\nratio will be negative.\n\n[^1]: We use extended reals to avoid dealing with separate cases,\n    allowing us to deal also with points at infinity.",
