  "definition": "The [*secant line*]{} (or simply the [*secant*]{}) of a curve is a\nstraight line intersecting the curve in at least two distinct points.\n\\[The name is initially a participial form of the Latin verb\n[*secare*]{} \u2018\u2019.\\]\n\nIf one sets a secant e.g. to the \u201ccubic parabola\u201d $y = x^3$ through its\npoints $(0,\\,0)$ and $(1,\\,1)$, there is also a third common point\n$(-1,\\,-1)$.\n\nNotice that a secant line can also be tangent to the curve at some\npoint, given that tangency is only a local property. In the following\npicture, $l$ is a secant line for the curve $C$ (since it intersects the\ncurve at points $A$ and $B$), yet it is also a tangent line at the point\n$A$.\n\n![image](secant)",
