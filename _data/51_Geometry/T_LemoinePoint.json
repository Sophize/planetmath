  "definition": "The Lemoine point of a triangle, is the intersection point of its three\nsymmedians. (That is, the isogonal conjugate of the centroid).\n\nIt is related with the Gergonne point by the following result:\\\nOn any triangle $ABC$, the Lemoine point of its Gergonne triangle is the\nGergonne point of $ABC$.\n\n![image](lemoinep)\n\nIn the picture, the blue lines are the medians, intersecting an the\ncentroid $G$. The green lines are anglee bisectors intersecting at the\nincentre $I$ and the red lines are symmedians. The symmedians intersect\nat Lemoine point $L$.",
