  "definition": "The word orthogonal comes from the Greek *orthe* and *gonia*, or \u201cright\nangle.\u201d It was originally used as synonym of perpendicular. This is\nwhere the use of \u201corthogonal\u201d in orthogonal lines, orthogonal circles,\nand other geometric terms come from.\n\nIn the realm of linear algebra, two vectors are orthogonal when their\ndot product is zero, which gave rise a generalization of two vectors on\nsome inner product space (not necessarily dot product) being orthogonal\nwhen their inner product is zero.\n\nThere are also particular definitions on the following entries:\n\n-   orthogonal matrices\n\n-   orthogonal polynomials\n\n-   orthogonal vectors\n\nIn a more broad sense, it can be said that two objects are orthogonal if\nthey do not \u201ccoincide\u201d in some way.",
