  "statement": "Every bijective order-preserving map (projectivity)\n$f:PG(V)\\rightarrow PG(W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces of\nfinite dimension not equal to 2, is induced by a semilinear\ntransformation $\\hat{f}:V\\rightarrow W$.\n\n(Refer to [@GW Theorem 3.5.5,Theorem 3.5.6].)\n\nAs an immediate corollary we notice that in fact $V$ and $W$ are vector\nspaces of the same dimension and over the isomorphic fields (or division\nrings). The dimension aspect is easily seen in other ways, and if the\nfields are finite fields so too is the entire corollary. However the\ntrue corollary to this theorem is\n\n$P\\Gamma L(V)$ is the automorphism group of the projective geometry,\n$PG(V)$, of $V$, when $\\dim V>2$.\n\n$P\\Gamma L(V)$ is the group of invertible semi-linear transformations of\na vector space $V$. (See for a full description of $P\\Gamma L(V)$.)\n\nNotice that $\\operatorname{Aut }PG(0,k)=1$ and\n$\\operatorname{Aut }PG(1,k)=Sym(k{\\cup}\\{\\infty\\})$. ($Sym(X)$ is the\nsymmetric group on the set $X$. $\\infty$ simply denotes a formal element\noutside of the field $k$ which in many concrete instances does capture a\nconceptual notion of infinity. For example, when $k=\\mathbb{R}$ this\ncorresponds to the vertical line through the origin, and so it has slope\n$\\infty$, while the other elements of $k$ are the slopes of the other\nlines.)\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry is in many ways \u201cbest\npossible.\u201d For if $\\dim V=2$ then $PG(V)$ has only the two trivial\nsubspace $0$ and $V$ \u2013 which cannot be moved by order preserving maps \u2013\nand subspaces of dimension 1. Thus any two proper subspaces can be\ninterchanged, transposed. So in this case all permutation of points in\nthe projective line $PG(V)$ are order-preserving. Not all permutations\narrise as semilinear maps however.\n\n**Example.** If $k=\\mathbb{Z}_p$, then there are no field automorphisms\nas $k$ is a prime field. Hence all semilinear transforms are simply\nlinear transforms. There are $p+1$ subspaces of dimension 1 in $V=k^2$\nso $\\operatorname{Aut }PG(V)$ is the symmetric group on $p+1$ points,\n$S_{p+1}$. Yet the permutation $\\pi$ mapping\n$$\\pi(1,0)=(0,1),\\quad \\pi(0,1)=(1,0),\\quad \\pi(x,y)=(x,y), \\qquad (x,y)\\notin\\{(1,0),(0,1)\\}$$\nis therefore order-preserving by clearly non-linear, unless $p=2$.\n$\\Box$\n\nThere is a second form the fundamental theorem of projective geometry\nwhich appeals to the axiomatic construction of projective geometry.\n\n[10]{}\n\nGruenberg, K.
