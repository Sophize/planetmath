  "definition": "[*Locus*]{} (from Latin [*locus*]{} \u2018\u2019) is a set of points satisfying a\ncertain condition and such that no point outside the set satisfies this\ncondition.\n\nFor example, in the plane the locus of such point that is at a fixed\ndistance $r$ from a fixed point $O$ is the circle with centre $O$ and\nradius $r$; the locus of such point which is equidistant from both ends\nof a line segment is the perpendicular bisector of this line segment.\n\nIn general, the loci in the plane are geometric curves; thus one may\nspeak of [*locus curves*]{}.",
