  "definition": "The *Poincar\u00e9 disc model* for $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the disc\n$\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x^2+y^2<1 \\}$ in which a point is similar to\nthe Euclidean point and a line must be one of the following:\n\n-   a diameter (excluding its endpoints) of the unit circle;\n\n-   an arc (excluding its endpoints) of a circle such that it intersects\n    the unit circle at two distinct points and the two circles are\n    perpendicular at both intersection points.\n\n(-2,-2)(2,2) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{}\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9 disc model has the drawback that lines in the model do not\nresemble Euclidean lines; however, it has the advantage that it is angle\npreserving. That is, the Euclidean of an angle within the model is the\nangle measure in hyperbolic geometry. For this reason, this model is\nalso referred to as the *conformal disc model*. (See the entry conformal\nfor more details.)\n\nSome points outside of the Poincar\u00e9 disc model are important for\nconstructions within the model. The following is an example of such:\n\nLet $\\ell$ be a line in the Poincar\u00e9 disc model that is not a diameter\nof the circle. The *pole* of $\\ell$ is the intersection of the Euclidean\nlines that are to the circle at the endpoints of $\\ell$.\n\n(-3,-2)(3,5) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-2)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{} (0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{} (-2,4.4)\n(-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{} (-2,-2)[.]{} (-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{}\n\nNote that this matches the definition of pole for the Beltrami-Klein\nmodel. Also, poles are important for the same reason that they are\nimportant in the Beltrami-Klein model: Given a line $\\ell$ that is not a\ndiameter of the Poincar\u00e9 disc model, one constructs a line perpendicular\nto $\\ell$ by considering Euclidean lines passing through $P(\\ell)$.\nThus, two disjointly parallel lines $\\ell$ and $m$ that are not\ndiameters of the Poincar\u00e9 disc model, one constructs their common\nperpendicular by connecting their poles. It is actually much easier to\ndo this construction by finding the poles of the two lines, finding the\ncommon perpendicular with respect to the Beltrami-Klein model, then\nconverting the common perpendicular to the Poincar\u00e9 disc model. See the\nentry on converting between the Beltrami-Klein model and the Poincar\u00e9\ndisc model for more details.\n\nIn all pictures in this entry from this point on, blue segments are\nlines in the Beltrami-Klein model, and red arcs are lines in the\nPoincar\u00e9 disc model.\n\nBelow is a picture of two disjointly parallel lines $\\ell$ and $m$ in\nthe Poincar\u00e9 disc model, neither of which is a diamter of the unit\ncircle:\n\n(-2,-2)(2,2) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{}\n(0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{} (0,-2.5)[1.5]{}[36.87]{}[143.13]{} (0.8,-1.6)[$m$]{}\n(-2,0)[.]{} (0,2)[.]{} (2,0)[.]{} (0,-2)[.]{}\n\nTheir poles can be found:\n\n(-3,-3)(3,5.1) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-3)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-2.4,-0.7)(0.4,-2.8) (-0.4,-2.8)(2.4,-0.7)\n(-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{} (0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{}\n(0,-2.5)[1.5]{}[36.87]{}[143.13]{} (0.8,-1.6)[$m$]{} (-2,4.4)(0,-2.5)\n(-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{} (0.2,-2.5)[$P(m)$]{} (-2,-3)[.]{}\n(-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{}\n\nThe common perpendicular with respect to the Beltrami-Klein model can be\nfound:\n\n(-3,-3)(3,5.1) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-3)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-2.4,-0.7)(0.4,-2.8) (-0.4,-2.8)(2.4,-0.7)\n(-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{} (0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{}\n(0,-2.5)[1.5]{}[36.87]{}[143.13]{} (0.8,-1.6)[$m$]{} (-2,4.4)(0,-2.5)\n(-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{} (0.2,-2.5)[$P(m)$]{} (-2,-3)[.]{}\n(-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{} (-2.2,5.09)(0.1,-2.845)\n(-1.19,1.6055)(-0.1465,-1.9946)\n\nFrom this, the common perpendicular $n$ with respect to the Poincar\u00e9\ndisc model can be found:\n\n(-6,-3)(3,5.1) (0,0)[2]{} (-2,-3)(-2,5) (-2.7172,5)(2.828,0.18)\n(-5.4,1.47)(0.4,-2.8) (-0.4,-2.8)(2.4,-0.7)\n(-2,4.828)[4.828]{}[270]{}[315]{} (0,0.7)[$\\ell$]{}\n(0,-2.5)[1.5]{}[36.87]{}[143.13]{} (0.8,-1.6)[$m$]{}\n(-2,4.4)(0,-2.5)(-5.265,-1.6187) (-1.9,4.4)[$P(\\ell)$]{}\n(0.2,-2.5)[$P(m)$]{} (-2,-3)[.]{} (-2.7172,5)[.]{} (2.828,0.18)[.]{}\n(-2.2,5.09)(0.1,-2.845) (-1.19,1.6055)(-0.1465,-1.9946)\n(-5.5,-1.8046)(2.9,4.84151) (-5.5,-1.8046)[.]{} (-5.5,-1.6)(3,-2.226)\n(-5.265,-1.6187)[5.1963]{}[-4.2]{}[38.35]{} (0,-0.3)[$n$]{}",
