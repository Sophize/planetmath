  "definition": "Introduction\n============\n\nA *NURBS curve*, which is an acronym for *Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline\ncurve*, is a generalization of both and curves. NURBS are commonly used\nin computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), engineering (CAE),\nand manufacturing (CAM).\n\nDefinition\n==========\n\nA NURBS curve is a parametric curve defined by its , a set of weighted\ncontrol points, and a knot vector. It is defined as\n\n$$c(u) = \\frac { \\sum_{i=0}^{n} N_{i,p}(u) w_i P_i} {\\sum_{i=0}^{n} N_{i,p}(u) w_i} \\quad\\quad 0 \\leq u \\leq 1$$\n\nwhere $u$ is the parameter, $p$ is the , $N_{i,p}$ are the B-spline\nbasis functions, $P_i$ are the control points and $w_i$ are the weights.",
