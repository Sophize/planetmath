  "definition": "A *primitive* is a geometric figure that is left undefined. Properties\nof primitives are assumed via axioms of the geometry. From these axioms,\none can gain some understanding of primitives, but they are technically\nnot defined.\n\nPrimitives are typically the simplest figure considered in the geometry.\nThis occurs because it is easier to create more complicated figures from\nsimpler ones; it seems backwards to leave complicated figures undefined\nand attempt to define simpler figures from these.\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, the primitives are typically taken to be point,\nline, and plane. On PlanetMath, these all have \u201cdefinitions\u201d. Upon\ninvestigation, however, Euclid\u2019s definition for point, \u201cthat which has\nno part,\u201d is a description rather than a definition, and the other\ndefinitions require knowledge of vector spaces, topology, or point-free\ngeometry. Similarly, the PlanetMath definitions of line and plane\nrequire knowledge of other of mathematics.\n\nThe \u201cfigure\u201d in the geometric sense is currently a primitive according\nto PlanetMath. It is used in many different entries, including this one\n(in the first for example), with the assumption that the reader knows\nwhat is meant by the .",
