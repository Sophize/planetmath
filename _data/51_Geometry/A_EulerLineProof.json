  "argumentText": "Let $O$ the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$ and $G$ its centroid. Extend\n$OG$ until a point $P$ such that $OG/GP=1/2$. We\u2019ll prove that $P$ is\nthe orthocenter $H$.\n\nDraw the median $AA'$ where $A'$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Triangles\n$OGA'$ and $PGA$ are similar, since $GP=2GO$, $AG=2A'G$ and\n$\\angle OGA'=\\angle PGA$. Then $\\angle OA'G =\\angle PGA$ and\n$OA'\\parallel AP$. But $OA'\\perp BC$ so $AP\\perp BC$, that is, $AP$ is a\nheight of the triangle.\n\nRepeating the same argument for the other medians proves that $P$ lies\non the three heights and therefore it must be the orthocenter $H$.\n\nThe ratio is $OG/GH=1/2$ since we constructed it that way.",
