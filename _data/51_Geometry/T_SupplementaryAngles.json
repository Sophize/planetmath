  "definition": "Two angles are called [*supplementary angles*]{} of each other if the\nsum of their is equal to the straight angle $\\pi$, $180^\\circ$.\\\nFor example, when two lines intersect each other, they the plane into\nfour disjoint corresponding to four convex angles; then any of these\nangles has a supplementary angle on either side of it (see linear pair).\nHowever, two angles that are supplementary to each other do not need to\nhave a common side \u2014 see an entry regarding .\\\nSupplementary angles have always equal sines, but the cosines are\nopposite numbers:\n$$\\sin(\\pi\\!-\\!\\alpha) \\;=\\; \\sin\\alpha, \\qquad \\cos(\\pi\\!-\\!\\alpha) \\;=\\; -\\cos\\alpha$$\nThese formulae may be proved by using the subtraction formulas of sine\nand cosine.",
