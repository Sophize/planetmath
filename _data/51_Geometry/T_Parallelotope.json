  "definition": "A parallelotope is the covering term used to denote any element of the\nseries of geometric objects generalizing the parallelogram:\n\n![image](parallelotope)\\\n\nThe hypercube is formed by moving the parallelepiped in a fourth\ndirection, thus creating a 4-dimensional object bounded by 8\nparallelepipeds (2 for each axis of freedom). The volume of an\nn-parallelotope can be calculated by taking the product of its lengths\nin each dimension or by taking the absolute value of the determinant of\nthe vectors spanning it.",
