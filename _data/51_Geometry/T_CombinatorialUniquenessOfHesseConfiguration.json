  "definition": "In this article, we will show that a collection of objects which has the\nincidence structure of a Hesse configuration is unique up to relabeling.\n\nAn *abstract Hesse configuration* is a pair of sets $(P,L)$ which\nsatisfies the following conditions:\n\n1.  $P$ has nine elements\n\n2.  Every element of $L$ is a subset of $P$ with three elements.\n\n3.  For any two distinct elements $x,y$ of $P$, there exists exactly one\n    element of $L$ which contains both $x$ and $y$.\n\nIf $(P,L)$ is an abstract Hesse configuration, then $L$ has 12 elements.\n\nLet $D$ be the set of all two-element subsets of $P$. Then $D$ has\n${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ elements. Each element of $L$ is a subset of $P$\nwith three elements, hence has ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ subsets of\ncardinality 2. By the definition above, every element of $D$ must be a\nsubset of exactly one element of $L$. For this to be possible, $L$ must\nhave cardinality $36/3 = 12$.\n\nIf $(P,L)$ is an abstract Hesse configuration then, for every $p \\in P$,\nthere exist exactly four elements $\\ell \\in L$ such that $p \\in \\ell$.\n\nTo every $q \\in P$ such that $q \\neq p$, there exists exactly one\n$\\ell \\in L$ such that $p \\in \\ell$ and $q \\in \\ell$. Furthermore, for\nevery $\\ell \\in L$ such that $p \\in \\ell$, there will be exactly two\nelements of $\\ell$ other than $p$. Hence, there exist $(9-1)/2 = 4$\nelements $\\ell \\in L$ such that $p \\in \\ell$.\n\nIf $(P,L)$ is an abstract Hesse configuration and $\\ell \\in L$, then\nthere exist $m,n \\in L$ such that $\\ell \\cap m =\n\\ell \\cap n = m \\cap n = \\emptyset$.\n\nBy the foregoing result, given $p \\in \\ell$, there are four elements of\n$L$ to which $p$ belongs. One of these, of course, is $\\ell$ itself, and\nthe other three are distinct from $\\ell$. Since $\\ell$ has three\nelements, this means that there are at most $3 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 10$\nelements $k \\in L$ such that $P \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$. Because $L$ has\n12 elements. there must exist $m,n \\in L$ such that\n$\\ell \\cap m = \\ell \\cap n = \n\\emptyset$.\n\nIt remains to show that $m \\cap n = \\emptyset$. Suppose to the contrary\nthat there exists a $p$ such that $p \\in m$ and $p \\in n$. Since\n$m \\cap \\ell = \\emptyset$, it follows that $p \\notin \\ell$, hence there\nwill exist three distinct elements of $L$ containing $p$ and an element\nof $\\ell$. Because $\\ell \\cap m = \\ell \\cap n = \\emptyset$, these three\nelements are distinct from $m$ and $n$. That makes for a total of five\ndistinct elements of $L$ containing $p$, which contradicts the previous\ntheorem, hence $m \\cap n = \\emptyset$.\n\nIf $m,n,k$ are elements of $L$ such that $m \\cap n = n \\cap k \n= k \\cap m = \\emptyset$ and $\\ell \\in L \\setminus \\{m,n,k\\}$, then\n$\\ell$ has exactly one element in common with each of $m,n,k$.\n\nSince each element of $L$ is a subset of $P$ with three elements and\n$m,n,k$ are pairwise disjoint but $P$ only has nine elements, it follows\nthat every element of $P$ must belong to exactly one of $m,n,k$. In\nparticular, this means that every element of $\\ell$ must belong to one\nof $m,n,k$. Were two elements of $\\ell$ to belong to the same element of\n$\\{m,n,k\\}$ then, by the third defining property, that element would\nhave to equal $\\ell$, contrary to its definition. Hence, each element of\n$\\ell$ must belong to a distinct element of $\\{m,n,k\\}$.\n\nIf $(P,L)$ is an abstract Hesse configuration, then we can label the\nelements of $P$ as A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I in such a way that the elements of\n$L$ are $$\\{A,B,C\\}, \\{D,E,F\\}, \\{G,H,I\\},$$\n$$\\{A,D,G\\}, \\{B,E,H\\}, \\{C,F,I\\},$$\n$$\\{D,H,C\\}, \\{A,E,I\\}, \\{B,F,G\\},$$\n$$\\{B,D,I\\}, \\{C,E,G\\}, \\{A,F,H\\}.$$\n\nBy theorem 3, there exist $a,b,c \\in L$ such that\n$a \\cap b = b \\cap c = c \\cap a = \\emptyset$. Since $L$ has twelve\nelements, there must exist an a elemetn of $L$ distinct from $a,b,c$.\nPick such an element and call it $d$. By another application of theorem\n3, there must exist $e,f \\in L$ such that\n$d \\cap e = e \\cap f = f \\cap d = \\emptyset$.\n\nBy theorem 4, $a$ must have exactly one element in common with each of\n$d,e,f$; let $A$ the element it has in common with $d$, $B$ be the\nelement it has in common with $e$ and $C$ be the element it has in\ncommon with $f$. Likewise, $b$ must have exactly one element in common\nwith each of $d,e,f$, as must $c$. Let $D$ be the element $b$ has in\ncommon with $d$, $E$ be the element $b$ has in common with $e$, $F$ be\nthe element $b$ has in common with $f$, $G$ be the element $c$ has in\ncommon with $d$, $H$ be the element $c$ has in common with $e$ and $I$\nbe the element $c$ has in common with $f$.\n\nSummarizing what we just said another way, we have assigned labels\n$A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I$ to the elements of $P$ in such a way that\n$$a = \\{A,B,C\\}, ~ b = \\{D,E,F\\}, ~ c = \\{G,H,I\\},$$\n$$d = \\{A,D,G\\}, ~ e = \\{B,E,H\\}, ~ f = \\{C,F,I\\}.$$ That is half of\nwhat we set out to do; we must still label the remaining six elements of\n$L$.\n\nBy theorem 4, if $\\ell \\in L \\setminus \\{a,b,c,d,e,f\\}$, then $\\ell$\nmust have exactly one element in common with each of $a,b,c$ and exactly\none element in common with each of $d,e,f$.\n\nSuppose that $A \\in \\ell$. It could not be the case that $D \\in \\ell$\nbecause then $\\ell$ would have two elements in common with $d$. Since\n$\\ell$ must have one element in common with $b$, that means that either\n$E \\in \\ell$ or $F \\in \\ell$. If $A,E \\in \\ell$, then the element $\\ell$\nhas in common with $c$ cannot be $G$ because $\\ell$ would have both $A$\nand $G$ in common with $c$ and it cannot be $H$ because $\\ell$ and $e$\nwould have both $E$ and $H$ in common, hence the only possibility is to\nhave $I \\in \\ell$, i.e. $\\ell = \\{A,E,I\\}$. Likewise, if $A,F \\in \\ell$,\nit follows that $H \\in \\ell$.\n\nSummarrizing the last few sentences, if $A \\in \\ell$, then either\n$\\ell = \\{A,E,I\\}$ or $\\ell = \\{A,F,H\\}$. By a similar line of\nreasoning, if $B \\in \\ell$, then either $\\ell = \n\\{B,D,I\\}$ or $\\ell = \\{B,F,G\\}$ and, if $B \\in \\ell$, then either\n$\\ell = \\{C,D,H\\}$ or $\\ell = \\{C,E,G\\}$. Since $\\ell$ must contain one\nof $A,B,C$, it follows that there are omnly the following six\npossibilities for $\\ell$: $$\\{D,H,C\\}, \\{A,E,I\\}, \\{B,F,G\\},$$\n$$\\{B,D,I\\}, \\{C,E,G\\}, \\{A,F,H\\}.$$ However, since\n$L \\setminus \\{a,b,c,d,e,f\\}$ has cardinality six, all these\npossibilities must be actual members of the set.",
