  "definition": "Definition\n==========\n\nLet $(A,B)$ be a linear ordered geometry, where $A= (P,n,I)$ is an\nincidence geometry, and $B$ is a strict betweenness relation. Recall\nthat $P$ is partitioned into disjoint sets $P_0, \\ldots, P_n$, where $n$\nis a positive integer.\n\nFor $0\\le i<n$, let $$\\begin{aligned}\nB_i &=& \\{(p,a,q)\\in P_0 \\times P_i \\times P_0 \\mid   \n p,q \\textrm{ do not lie on } a, \\\\ && \\textrm{and there\nexists a point } r \\textrm{ lying on  } a \\textrm{ such that }(p,r,q)\\in B\\},\\end{aligned}$$\nand $$B_i(a)=\\lbrace (p,q)\\mid (p,a,q)\\in\nB_i\\rbrace .$$\n\nFor any $a\\in P_i$, the set is symmetric and anti-reflexive.\\\nWe say that the *hyperplane $a \\in P_i$ is between $p$ and $q$* if\n$(p,q)\\in B_i(a)$.\\\nWe see that $B_0=B$.\\\nLet\u2019s look at the case when $i=1$. If $(p,\\ell,q)\\in B_1$ where $\\ell$\nis a line, then $p,q$ and $\\ell$ necessarily lie on a common plane\n$\\pi$.\n\n![image](betweenness)\n\nThe above diagram seems to suggest that $\\ell$ \u201cseparates $\\pi$ into two\nregions\u201d. However, this is not true in general without the next axiom.\\\nAn *ordered geometry* $(A,B)$ is a linear ordered geometry such that\n\n-   for any three non-collinear points $p,q,r$, and any line $\\ell$\n    lying on the same plane $\\pi$ generated by $p,q,r$, if $(p,q)\\in\n    B_1(\\ell)$ and if $r$ does not lie on $\\ell$, then at least one of\n    $(q,r),(r,p)\\in B_1(\\ell)$.\n\nIn fact, in axiom S1, it can be shown that exactly one of $(q,r)$ and\n$(r,p)$ is in $B_1(\\ell)$. This axiom says that \u201ca line lying on a plane\nseparates the plane into two mutually exclusive subsets\u201d.\\\nEach subset is called an (open) *half plane* of the line.\\\nA closed half plane is just the union of one of its open half planes and\nthe line itself.\\\nSuppose points $p,q$ and line $\\ell$ lie on plane $\\pi$ and that $\\ell$\nis between $p$ and $q$. Then we say that $p$ and $q$ are on the\n*opposite sides of line* $\\ell$. Two points are on the *same* side of\nline $\\ell$ if they are not on the opposite sides of $\\ell$. If $r$ is a\nthird point (distinct from $p,q$) that lies on $\\pi$ and not on $\\ell$,\nthen according to axiom S1 above, $r$ must be on the same side of either\n$p$ or $q$ (but not both!). Same sidedness is an equivalence relation on\npoints of $A$.\n\n![image](betweenness1)\n\n3 An equivalent characterization of axiom S1 is in the form of Pasch\u2019s\ntheorem.\\\n\\\nThe ten conditions or axioms (seven betweenness, two collinearity, and\none \u201cseparation\u201d axioms) are sometimes called the \u201corder axioms\u201d of\n$A$.\\\n\\\nIt is customary, in an ordered geometry, to identify each element of $P$\nby its (a subset of $P_0$), and we shall do so in this discussion. A\nline, for example, will then consist of points that are incident with\nit, as opposed to an abstract element of $P_1$. Hence, we shall also\nconfuse the notation ${\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$ with\n$I_0({\\overleftrightarrow{pq}})$.\\\n\\\n\nRemarks\n=======\n\n-   **Law of Trichotomy** on a strict betweenness relation: Let $B$ be a\n    strict betweenness relation. If $p,q,r$ are collinear, then exactly\n    one of $(p,q,r)$, $(q,r,p)$, or $(r,p,q)\\in B$.\n\n-   In an ordered geometry, one can define familiar concepts, such as a\n    line segment, a ray, even an angle, using the order axioms above.\n    For example, $B_{p*q}$ is called the *open line segment* between $p$\n    and $q$, and is more commonly denoted by $\\overline{pq}$, or\n    $(p,q)$. A *closed line segment* between $p$ and $q$ is just\n    $\\lbrace p\\rbrace \\cup \\overline{pq}\\cup \\lbrace q\\rbrace$, denoted\n    by $[p,q]$. From the third remark under betweenness relation,\n    $\\overline{pq}=B_{p*q}=B_{q*p}=\\overline{qp}$. The points $p$ and\n    $q$ are called the *end points* of $\\overline{pq}$.\n\n-   A *ray* is defined to be $B_{pq}$. For a more detailed discussion,\n    see the .\n\n-   ${\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}=B(p,q)$.\n\n-   $\\overline{pq}\\subset{\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$. The inclusion is\n    strict, since there exists a point $r$ such that $(p,q,r)\\in B$ by\n    order axiom S1. $r$ lies on the ${\\overleftrightarrow{pq}}$ and is\n    clearly distinct from both $p$ and $q$.\n\n-   Any line segment $\\overline{pq}$ in an ordered geometry, in to being\n    orderable, is linearly orderable, thanks to the Law of Trichotomy.\n\n-   It fact, $\\le$, defined on a line segment, can be extended to a\n    linear order defined on the line that includes the segment (see the\n    last remark above on betweenness relation). This shows that every\n    line in an ordered geometry can be linearly ordered.\n\n[6]{} D. Hilbert, [*Foundations of Geometry*]{}, Open Court Publishing\nCo. (1971) K. Borsuk and W.
