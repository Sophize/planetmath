  "statement": "We all know the elementary formula to compute the area of a triangle:\nbasis times height divided by two. This formula can be justified with a\nscissor type argument: one divides the triangle into smaller polygons\nand rearranges these polygons to obtain a rectangle which should have\nthe same area.\n\nCan we use the same argument to compute the volume of a pyramid? This is\nthe third Hilbert\u2019s problem. Quite surprisingly the answer is negative,\nas states the theorem below. This means that the formulae to compute the\nvolume of polyhedra cannot be proved without a limiting process (for\nexample using integrals).\n\nWe say that two polyhedra $P$ and $Q$ are *scissor-equivalent* if there\nexists a finite number $P_1,\\ldots, P_N$ of polyhedra and\n$\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_N$ isometries such that\n\n1.  $P=\\bigcup_{k=1}^N P_k$ and $Q=\\bigcup_{k=1}^N \\theta_k(P_k)$;\n\n2.  $P_j\\cap P_k$ and $\\theta_j(P_j) \\cap \\theta_k(P_k)$ have empty\n    interior for every $k\\neq j$\n\nThe properties given above assure that two scissor-equivalent polyhedra\nmust have the same volume. It is also simple to prove that the\nscissor-equivalence is indeed an equivalence relation.\n\nThe regular tetrahedron is not *scissor-equivalent* to any\nparallelepiped.",
