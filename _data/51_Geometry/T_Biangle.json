  "definition": "In spherical geometry, it is possible to form a polygon with only two\nsides. Thus, we have the following definition:\n\nA *biangle* is a two-sided polygon that is strictly contained in one\nhemisphere of the sphere that is serving as the model for spherical\ngeometry.\n\nGiven a biangle, its vertices must be antipodal points, and its two\nangles must be congruent. Therefore, every biangle is equiangular. Since\neach side of a biangle is half of a great circle, every biangle is\nequilateral. Hence, every biangle is regular.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the radian of each angle of a biangle. Then the biangle\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}$ of the sphere. Since the area of the\nsphere is $4\\pi$, the area of the biangle is $2\\theta$. Note that this\nequals the angle sum of the biangle.",
