  "definition": "It is well-known that if one starts out with a field (or a division\nring) $k$, one can construct a projective space by taking sets of the\nform\n$\\lbrace r(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\mid r,a_i\\in k, \\mbox{ not all }a_i=0\\rbrace$\nas points of the space, which also serve as \u201ccoordinates\u201d of the points.\nWith the algebraic properties of $k$, one can easily show that all of\nthe axioms of projective geometry are satisfied.\n\nCan we reverse the process, starting with the geometric axioms, and then\nconstructing a coordinate system for the points of the geometry, and at\nthe same time deriving an algebraic system supporting the coordinate\nsystem? If so, what will this algebraic system be, a field, a division\nring, or something else?\n\nThe answer to the first question is yes! In fact, the construction is\nnot too dissimilar to how the Cartesian coordinate system is constructed\nfor Euclidean geometry. In this entry, we confine ourselves to the\nconstruction of a coordinate system for a projective plane.\n\nBefore proceeding to the construction, recall that a projective plane\nconsists a set of points, a set of lines, and an incidence relation\nbetween the points and the lines, such that every two distinct points\nare incident with a unique line, two distinct lines are incident with a\nunique point, and, to avoid non-degenerate cases, the plane contains a\nquandrangle (four pairwise distinct points, no three of which are\ncollinear). Also, for any two distinct points $P,Q$, we write $PQ$ the\nline incident with $P$ and $Q$, and for any two distinct lines\n$\\ell_1,\\ell_2$, we write $\\ell_1\\cap \\ell_2$ their intersection (the\npoint incident with both lines).\n\nThere are at least two ways of doing this. Both methods start with a\nquandrangle, say, points $O,I,X,Y$. We call $O$ the origin, lines $OX$\nand $OY$ are the $X$ and $Y$ axes, while line $\\ell:=XY$ is the \u201cline at\ninfinity\u201d, and $\\iota:=OI$ the \u201cidentity line\u201d (think of the slope 1\nline on the Euclidean plane).\n\n(-4,-3)(4,3) (-4,-3)(-1,3) (-4.5,-2.5)(3.5,-2.5) (3,-3)(-1.5,3)\n(-4.5,-2.835)(2.5,0) (-2.5,-2.025) (-3.75,-2.5) (-1.2,2.6) (2.625,-2.5)\n(-2.5,-2)[$I$]{} (-3.7,-2.25)[$O$]{} (-1,2.55)[$Y$]{} (2.5,-2.1)[$X$]{}\n(0.05,1.155)[$\\ell$]{} (-0.75,-1.3163)[$\\iota$]{}\n(-0.6,-2.5)[$X$-axis]{} (-2.35,0.15)[$Y$-axis]{}\n\nAs far as coordinates go, points on $\\ell$ will have single coordinates,\nwhile others will have pairs of coordinates. The first method goes as\nfollows:\n\n1.  Label points on $\\iota$, so that the label for $O$ is $0$ and $I$ is\n    $1$. Call this set of labels $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\n2.  If a point on $\\iota$ but not on $\\ell$ has label $p$, then let\n    $(p,p)$ be its coordinates. In particular, $O$ and $I$ have\n    coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ respectively.\n\n3.

In other words, if a\npoint has coordinate $x$ using the first method, then it has coordinate\n$x$ using the second method, and vice versa. Here $x$ could be $\\infty$,\na single coordinate, or a pair of coordinates.\n\nWith this coordinatization, we may identify points of the projective\nplain with their coordinates.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   The reason why we call $\\ell$ ($=XY$) the \u201cline at infinity\u201d is\n    this: imagine if we stretch points $X$ and $Y$ to infinity, then we\n    basically have an affine plane! More precisely, call points on\n    $\\ell$ \u201cpoints at infinity\u201d, and any two lines that are not $\\ell$\n    \u201cparallel\u201d if they meet at a point at infinity. Then, by removing\n    $\\ell$, along with all the points on it, it is not hard to see that\n    the remaining points, lines, and the inherited incidence relation\n    form an affine plane.\n\n-   Moreover, the coordinates of points at infinity can be thought of as\n    slopes, in the following sense: if two (projective) lines meet at\n    $(m)$, then they are parallel (as affine lines), both having the\n    same slope ($m$). This is the reason why a point at infinity is also\n    called a *slope point*. So let us formally define the *slope* of a\n    line not equal to $\\ell$ as $m$, where $(m)$ is its intersection\n    with $\\ell$. From this, we see that the $X$-axis has slope $0$, the\n    identity line $\\iota$ has slope $1$, and the $Y$-axis has slope\n    $\\infty$.\n\n-   Another concept borrowed from Euclidean geometry is that of a\n    $Y$-intercept: a line other than the $Y$-axis has *$Y$-intercept*\n    $b$ if it intersects the $Y$-axis at $(0,b)$. Note that two lines\n    with the same slope and $Y$-intercept are identical.\n\n-   Lines can be coordinatized too. There are three cases:\n\n    1.  Any line not through $(\\infty)$ (the point $Y$) is given\n        coordinates $[\\,m,b\\,]$ where $m$ and $b$ are its slope and\n        $Y$-intercept respectively. So the $X$-axis becomes $[\\,0,0\\,]$\n        and $\\iota$ the identity line becomes $[\\,1,0\\,]$.\n\n    2.  Any line through $(\\infty)$, other than $\\ell$, gets coordinate\n        $[\\,a\\,]$ if it meets the $X$-axis at $(a,0)$. So the $Y$-axis\n        becomes $[\\,0\\,]$.\n\n    3.  Finally, $\\ell$ is given the coordinate $[\\,\\infty\\,]$.\n\n    (-4,-3)(4,3) (-4,-3)(-1,3) (-4.5,-2.5)(3.5,-2.5) (3,-3)(-1.5,3)\n    (-4,-1.35)(2.5,0) (-3.75,-2.5) (-1.2,2.6) (2.625,-2.5)\n    (-3.7,-2.25)[$(0,0)$]{} (-1,2.55)[$(\\infty)$]{} (2.5,-2.1)[$(0)$]{}\n    (0.05,1.155)[$[\\,\\infty\\,]$]{} (-0.6,-2.5)[$[\\,0,0\\,]$]{}\n    (-2,1.155)[$[\\,0\\,]$]{} (-3.0794,-1.1588) (0.9859,-0.3145)\n    (-3.5,-1.1588)[$(0,b)$]{} (1.25,-0.5)[$(m)$]{}\n    (-1.0468,-0.7366)[$[\\,m,b\\,]$]{}\n\n    Notice that Lines through $Y$ can not be given coordinates of the\n    form $[\\,m,b\\,]$, lest they will all receive the same coordinates\n    $[\\,\\infty,\\infty\\,]$.\n\nWe will answer the second question in another entry.\n\n[7]{} M.
