  "definition": "Let $V$ and $W$ be Euclidean vector spaces. A *Euclidean transformation*\nis an affine transformation $E:V\\to W$, given by $$E(v)=L(v)+w$$ such\nthat $L$ is an .\n\nAs an affine transformation, all affine properties, such as incidence\nand parallelism are preserved by $E$. In addition, since $E(u-v)=L(u-v)$\nand $L$ is an , $E$ preserves lengths of line segments and . Because of\nthis, a Euclidean transformation is also called a *rigid motion*, which\nis a popular term used in mechanics.\n\n### Types of Euclidean transformations {#types-of-euclidean-transformations .unnumbered}\n\nThere are three main types of Euclidean transformations:\n\n1.  **translation**. If $L=I$, then $E$ is just a translation. Any\n    Euclidean transformation can be decomposed into a product of an\n    orthogonal transformation $L(v)$, followed by a translation\n    $T(v)=v+w$.\n\n2.  **rotation**. If $w=0$, then $E$ is just an orthogonal\n    transformation. If $\\operatorname{det}(E)=1$, then $E$ is called a\n    *rotation*. The orientation of any basis (of $V$) is preserved under\n    a rotation. In the case where $V$ is two-dimensional, a rotation is\n    conjugate to a matrix of the form $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n    \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n    \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$. Via this\n    particular (unconjugated) map, any vector emanating from the origin\n    is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by an angle of $\\theta$\n    to another vector emanating from the origin. Thus, if $E$ is\n    conjugate to the matrix given above, then $\\theta$ is the *angle of\n    rotation* for $E$.\n\n3.  **reflection**. If $w=0$ but $\\operatorname{det}(E)=-1$ instead,\n    then $E$ is a called *reflection*. Again, in the two-dimensional\n    case, a reflection is to a matrix of the form $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\cos \\theta & \\sin \\theta \\\\\n    \\sin \\theta & -\\cos \\theta\n    \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$. Any\n    vector is reflected by this particular (unconjugated) map to another\n    by a \u201cmirror\u201d, a line of the form $y=x\\tan(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In general, an orthogonal transformation can be represented by a\n    matrix of the form $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n    A_1 & O & \\cdots & O \\\\\n    O & A_2 & \\cdots & O \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    O & O & \\cdots & A_n\n    \\end{pmatrix},$$ where each $A_i$ is either $\\pm 1$ or a rotation\n    matrix (1) (or reflection matrix (2)) given above. When its\n    determinant is -1 (a reflection), it has an invariant subspace of\n    $V$ of codimension 1. One can think of this hyperplane as the\n    mirror.\n\n-   Another common rigid motion is the *glide reflection*. It is a\n    Euclidean transformation that is expressible as a product of a\n    reflection, followed by a translation.",
