  "definition": "Let an angle whose in radians is $\\theta$ be placed the Cartesian plane\nsuch that one of its rays $R_1$ corresponds to the nonnegative $x$ axis\nand one can go from the point $(1,0)$ to the point that is the\nintersection of the other ray $R_2$ of the angle with the circle\n$x^2+y^2=1$ by traveling exactly $\\theta$ units on the circle. (If\n$\\theta$ is positive, the distance should be traveled counterclockwise;\notherwise, the distance $|\\theta|$ should be traveled clockwise. Also,\nnote that \u201cother ray\u201d is used quite loosely, as it may also correspond\nto the nonnegative $x$ axis also.) Then $R_2$ is the *terminal ray* of\nthe angle.\n\nThe picture below shows the terminal ray $R_2$ of the angle\n$\\displaystyle \\theta=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\n(-2,-3)(5,2) (-2,0)(2,0) (2,-0.3)[$x$]{} (0,-2)(0,2) (0,2)[$y$]{}\n(0,0)(2,0) (2,0.2)[$R_1$]{} (0,0)(-1.1,1.505) (-1,1.705)[$R_2$]{}\n(0,0)[0.3]{}[0]{}[120]{} (0.3,0.3)[$\\theta$]{} (0,0)[1.3]{}\n(-1.35,-1.9)[$x^2+y^2=1$]{}",
