  "definition": "*Pl\u00fccker\u2019s conoid* is a ruled surface that results from taking a\nstraight line connected to an axis, rotating it about that axis and\nmoving it straight up and down the axis to give the desired number of\nfolds. Being an example of a right conoid, Pl\u00fccker\u2019s conoid is sometimes\ncalled a conical wedge, or a conocuneus of Wallis or even a cylindroid.\n\nThe Cartesian equation for a conoid with two folds is\n$z = \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2}$. This can be generalized to any\ndesired number $n$ of folds as $x(r, \\theta) = r \\cos \\theta$,\n$y(r, \\theta) = r \\sin \\theta$ and $z(r, \\theta) = c \\sin (n\\theta)$.\nPl\u00fccker\u2019s conoid has applications in mechanical drafting.\n\n[1]{} J.
