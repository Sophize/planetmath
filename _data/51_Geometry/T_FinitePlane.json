  "definition": "A [**finite plane**]{} (synonym [****]{}) is the finite (discrete)\nanalogue of planes in more familiar geometries. It is an [**incidence\nstructure**]{} where any two [**points**]{} are incident with exactly\none [**line**]{} (the line is said to \u201cpass through\u201d those points, the\npoints \u201clie on\u201d the line), and any two [**lines**]{} are incident with\n[*at most*]{} one [**point**]{} \u2014 just like in ordinary planes, lines\ncan be [*parallel*]{} i.e.\u00a0not intersect in any point.\n\nA finite plane without parallel lines is known as a [**projective\nplane**]{}. Another kind of finite plane is an [**affine plane**]{},\nwhich can be obtained from a projective plane by removing one line (and\nall the points on it).\n\nExample {#example .unnumbered}\n-------\n\nAn example of a projective plane, that of order $2$, known as the *Fano\nplane* (for projective planes, [*order*]{} $q$ means $q+1$ points on\neach line, $q+1$ lines through each point):\n\n![image](fano)\n\nAn edge here is represented by a straight line, and the inscribed circle\nis also an edge. In other words, for a vertex set\n$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \\}$, the edges of the Fano plane are\n\n$$\\{1, 2, 4 \\}, \n\\{2, 3, 5 \\},\n\\{3, 4, 6 \\},\n\\{4, 5, 7 \\},\n\\{5, 6, 1 \\},\n\\{6, 7, 2 \\},\n\\{7, 1, 3 \\}$$\n\nNotice that the Fano plane is generated by the triple $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$ by\nrepeatedly adding $1$ to each entry, modulo $7$. The generating triple\nhas the property that the differences of any two elements, in either\norder, are all pairwise different modulo $7$. In general, if we can find\na set of $q+1$ of the integers (mod\u00a0$q^2 + q + 1$) with all pairwise\ndifferences distinct, then this gives a cyclic representation of the\nfinite plane of order $q$.",
