  "definition": "The equation of every conic section (and the degenerate cases) in the\nrectangular $(x,\\,y)$-coordinate system may be written in the form\n$$Ax^2+By^2 +2Cxy+2Dx+2Ey+F = 0,$$ where $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$\nare constants and $A^2+B^2+C^2 > 0.$[^1] (The $2Cxy$ is present only if\nthe axes are not parallel to the coordinate axes.)\n\nThe equation of the [*tangent line*]{} of an ordinary conic section\n(i.e., circle, ellipse, hyperbola and parabola) in the point\n$(x_0,\\,y_0)$ of the curve is\n$$Ax_0x+By_0y+C(y_0x+x_0y)+D(x+x_0)+E(y+y_0)+F = 0.$$ Thus, the equation\nof the tangent line can be obtained from the equation of the curve by\n[*polarizing*]{} it, i.e. by replacing\n\n$x^2$ with $x_0x$, $y^2$ with $y_0y$, $2xy$ with $y_0x+x_0y$, $2x$ with\n$x+x_0$, $2y$ with $y+y_0$.\n\n**Examples:** The of the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\nis $\\frac{x_0x}{a^2}+\\frac{y_0y}{b^2} = 1$, the of the hyperbola\n$xy = \\frac{1}{2}$ is $y_0x+x_0y = 1$.\n\n[^1]: This is true also in any skew-angled coordinate system.",
