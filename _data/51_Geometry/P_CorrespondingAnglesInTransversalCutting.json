The angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta_1$ are called\n*alternate interior angles* of each other.\n\nTwo lines that are perpendicular to the same line are parallel to each\nother.\n\nIf a line is perpendicular to one of two parallel lines, then it is also\nperpendicular to the other.\n\nIf the left sides of two convex angles are parallel (or alternatively\nperpendicular) as well as their right sides, then the angles are\ncongruent.\n\n[9]{} .
