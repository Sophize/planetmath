  "definition": "Two distinct half-planes, emanating from a same line $l$, the space\n($\\mathbb{R}^3$) into two regions called [*dihedral angles*]{}. The line\n$l$ is the [*edge*]{} of the dihedral angle and the bounding half-planes\nare its [*sides*]{}.\n\n(-3,-1)(3,3) (-2.5,-1)(1.5,-1)(2.5,0)(2,2)(-2,2) (-2,2)(-1.5,0)(-2.5,-1)\n(-2.1,0)(3,0) (0,0.2)[$l$]{} (-3,-1)[.]{} (3,3)[.]{}\n\nThe angle, which the sides of a dihedral planes separate from a normal\nplane of the edge, is the [*normal section*]{} of the dihedral angle.\nApparently, all normal sections are equal. According to the of the\nnormal section, the dihedral angle may be called acute, right, obtuse,\nstraight, , convex and concave. Unlike the angle between two planes, a\ndihedral angle may be over 90 .\n\nIf two planes intersect each other and if one of the four dihedral\nangles formed is right, then also the others are right. Then we say that\nthe planes are [*perpendicular*]{} to each other.",
