  "definition": "[*Cassini oval*]{} is the locus of the point $P$ in the plane having a\nconstant product of the distances $PF_1$ and $PF_2$ measured from two\n$F_1$ and $F_2$ of the plane.\n\nOne obtains the simplest equation for the Cassini oval by choosing $F_1$\nand $F_2$ on the other coordinate axis and equidistant ($= c > 0$) from\nthe origin. Let $F_1 = (-c,\\,0)$, $F_2 = (c,\\,0)$ and the locus\ncondition $$PF_1 \\cdot PF_2 \\;=\\; a^2 \\quad (a > 0).$$ This reads in the\nCartesian coordinates $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2}\\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2} \\;=\\; a^2,\\end{aligned}$$ which\nafter squaring may be written\n$$a^4 \\;=\\; (x^2\\!+\\!y^2\\!+\\!c^2\\!+\\!2cx)(x^2\\!+\\!y^2\\!+\\!c^2\\!-\\!2cx) \\;\\equiv\\; (x^2\\!+\\!y^2\\!+\\!c^2)^2-(2cx)^2,$$\ni.e. $$\\begin{aligned}\n(x^2\\!+\\!y^2\\!+\\!c^2)^2-4c^2x^2 \\;=\\; a^4.\\end{aligned}$$ One sees that\nthe curve is symmetric both in regard to $x$-axis and in regard to\n$y$-axis, whence it suffices to examine it in the first quadrant\n($x \\geqq 0$, $y \\geqq 0$). If (2) is written as $$\\begin{aligned}\ny^2 \\;=\\; \\sqrt{a^4\\!+\\!4c^2x^2}-(x^2\\!+\\!c^2),\\end{aligned}$$ it\nappears that $y$ is real only for\n$\\sqrt{a^4\\!+\\!4c^2x^2} \\geqq x^2\\!+\\!c^2$, which condition can be\nsimplified to $$\\begin{aligned}\n|x^2\\!-\\!c^2| \\;\\leqq\\; a^2.\\end{aligned}$$ In to $y$ being real, (4)\ngives the three cases:\\\n$1^{\\underline{o}}$. $a < c$. We have\n$\\sqrt{c^2\\!-\\!a^2} \\leqq x \\leqq \\sqrt{c^2\\!+\\!a^2}$; thus the curve\nconsists of two separate loops.\\\n$2^{\\underline{o}}$. $a = c$. Now $0 \\leqq x \\leqq c\\sqrt{2}$; the two\nloops meet in the origin (the [*lemniscate of Bernoulli*]{}).\\\n$3^{\\underline{o}}$. $a > c$. Then $0 \\leqq x \\leqq \\sqrt{c^2\\!+\\!a^2}$;\nthere is one loop surrounding the origin.\n\n(-3,-2.2)(3,2.5) (0,0)(-2.7,-1.5)(2.7,1.6) (0,0)[1]{} (-1,0) (+1,0)\n(0,0) (-3,-2.2)[.]{} (3,2.2)[.]{} (0,-1.7)[Cassinoids with $c = 1$\n(blue)]{}\n\nWhen $a$ gets different values (the parametre $c$ being unchanged), (2)\na family of curves. For any point $P$ of the plane (except\n$(\\pm c,\\,0)$), there is one representant of the family passing through\n$P$, corresponding the value $a = \\sqrt{PF_1 \\cdot PF_2}$.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the common name for all members of the family is\n[*Cassini curve*]{}, and only the special case, where $a = c\\sqrt{2}$,\nis the [*Cassini oval*]{} proper; it and the other members with\n$a \\geqq c\\sqrt{2}$ have the property of having only one highest point\n$(0,\\,\\sqrt{a^2\\!-\\!c^2})$. All other members (with $a < c\\sqrt{2}$)\nhave two distinct highest points.\n\nThe locus of the highest and lowest points of any member with\n$a \\leqq c\\sqrt{2}$ is obtained by solving (2) with respect to $x^2$,\n$$x^2 \\;=\\; c^2\\!-\\!y^2\\pm\\sqrt{a^4\\!-\\!4c^2y^2},$$ whence\n$y^2 \\leqq \\frac{a^4}{4c^2}$.
