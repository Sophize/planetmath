  "definition": "At the most general level, a [*cylindroid*]{} is simply a cylinder that\nhas been deformed in an intentional and well-defined way. The barrel die\nused in certain board role-playing games are sometimes described as\nbeing cylindroids in shape.\n\nMost mathematical dictionaries that define the term at all say nothing\nmore than \u201ca cylinder with an elliptical cross-section.\u201d (see for\nexample the [*Harper-Collins Dictionary of Mathematics*]{} and the\n[*Oxford Concise Dictionary of Mathematics*]{}.) The term is also used\nfor certain conoids, such as Pl\u00fccker\u2019s conoid.\n\nThe term is usually not included in general pocket dictionaries. The\n[*Random House Unabridged Dictionary*]{} defines cylindroid the noun as\n\u201ca solid having the form of a cylinder, esp\\[ecially\\] one with an\nelliptical, as opposed to a circular, cross section,\u201d and the adjective\nas \u201cresembling a cylinder.\u201d\n\n[1]{} S. P. Radzevich, \u201cA Possibility of Application of Pliicker\u2019s\nConoid for Mathematical Modeling of Contact of Two Smooth Regular\nSurfaces in the First Order of Tangency\u201d, [*Mathematical and Computer\nModelling*]{} [**42**]{} (2005): 999 - 1022",
