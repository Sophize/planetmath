  "definition": "Canonical quantization is a method of relating, or associating, a\nclassical system of the form $(T^*X, \\omega, H)$, where $X$ is a\nmanifold, $\\omega$ is the canonical symplectic form on $T^*X$, with a\n(more complex) quantum system represented by $H \\in C^\\infty(X)$, where\n$H$ is the . Some of the early formulations of quantum mechanics used\nsuch quantization methods under the umbrella of the *correspondence\nprinciple or postulate*. The latter states that a correspondence exists\nbetween certain classical and quantum operators, (such as the\nHamiltonian operators) or algebras (such as Lie or Poisson (brackets)),\nwith the classical ones being in the real ($\\mathbb{R}$) domain, and the\nquantum ones being in the complex ($\\mathbb{C}$) domain. Whereas all\nclassical observables and states are specified only by real numbers, the\n\u2019wave\u2019 amplitudes in quantum theories are represented by complex\nfunctions.\\\nLet $(x^i, p_i)$ be a set of Darboux coordinates on $T^*X$. Then we may\nobtain from each coordinate function an operator on the Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal{H} = L^2(X, \\mu)$, consisting of functions on $X$ that are\nsquare-integrable with respect to some measure $\\mu$, by the *operator\nsubstitution* rule: $$\\begin{aligned}\nx^i \\mapsto \\hat{x}^i &= x^i \\cdot, \\label{sub1}\\\\\np_i \\mapsto \\hat{p}_i &= -i \\hbar {\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x^i}} \\label{sub2},\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $x^i \\cdot$ is the \u201cmultiplication by $x^i$\u201d operator. Using this\nrule, we may obtain operators from a larger class of functions. For\nexample,\n\n1.  $x^i x^j \\mapsto \\hat{x}^i \\hat{x}^j = x^i x^j \\cdot$,\n\n2.  $p_i p_j \\mapsto \\hat{p}_i \\hat{p}_j = -\\hbar^2 {\\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial x^i x^j}}$,\n\n3.  if $i \\neq j$ then\n    $x^i p_j \\mapsto \\hat{x}^i \\hat{p}_j = -i \\hbar x^i {\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x^j}}$.\n\nThe substitution rule creates an ambiguity for the function $x^i p_j$\nwhen $i=j$, since $x^i p_j = p_j x^i$, whereas\n$\\hat{x}^i \\hat{p}_j \\neq \\hat{p}_j \\hat{x}^i$. This is the *operator\nordering* problem. One possible solution is to choose\n$$x^i p_j \\mapsto \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\hat{x}^i \\hat{p}_j + \\hat{p}_j \\hat{x}^i\\right),$$\nsince this choice produces an operator that is self-adjoint and\ntherefore corresponds to a physical observable. More generally, there is\na construction known as *Weyl quantization* that uses Fourier transforms\nto extend the substitution rules (\\[sub1\\])-(\\[sub2\\]) to a map\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nC^\\infty(T^*X) &\\to \\operatorname{Op}(\\mathcal{H}) \\\\\nf &\\mapsto \\hat{f}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis procedure is called \u201ccanonical\u201d because it preserves the canonical\nPoisson brackets. In particular, we have that\n$$\\frac{-i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{x}^i, \\hat{p}_j] := \\frac{-i}{\\hbar}\\left(\\hat{x}^i\\hat{p}_j - \\hat{p}_j\\hat{x}^i\\right) = \\delta^i_j,$$\nwhich agrees with the Poisson bracket $\\{ x^i, p_j \\} = \\delta^i_j$.\n\nLet $X = {\\mathbb{R}}$. The Hamiltonian function for a one-dimensional\npoint particle with mass $m$ is $$H = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x),$$ where\n$V(x)$ is the potential energy. Then, by operator substitution, we\nobtain the Hamiltonian operator\n$$\\hat{H} = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x).$$",
