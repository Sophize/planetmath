  "definition": "A generalisation of multi-dimensional integral, written\n$$\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\;\\mathrm{exp} \\left (\\mathcal{F} [\\phi] \\right )$$\nwhere $\\phi$ ranges over some restricted set of functions from a measure\nspace $X$ to some space with reasonably nice algebraic structure. The\nsimplest example is the case where $$\\phi \\in L^2[X,{\\mathbb{R}}]$$ and\n$$F[\\phi] = -\\pi \\int_X \\phi^2(x) d\\mu(x)$$ in which case it can be\nargued that the result is $1$. The argument is by analogy to the\nGaussian integral\n$\\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}^n} dx_1\\cdots dx_n e^{-\\pi\\sum x_j^2} \\equiv 1$.\nAlas, one can absorb the $\\pi$ into the measure on $X$. Alternatively,\nfollowing Pierre Cartier and others, one can use this analogy to\n[*define*]{} a measure on $L^2$ and proceed axiomatically.\n\nOne can bravely trudge onward and hope to come up with something, say \u00e0\nla Riemann integral, by partitioning $X$, picking some representative of\neach partition, approximating the functional $F$ based on these and\ncalculating a multi-dimensional integral as usual over the sample values\nof $\\phi$. This leads to some integral\n$${ \\int \\cdots}d\\phi(x_1) \\cdots d\\phi(x_n) e^{f(\\phi(x_1),\\ldots,\\phi(x_n))}.$$\nOne hopes that taking successively finer partitions of $X$ will give a\nsequence of integrals which converge on some nice limit. I believe\nPierre Cartier has shown that this doesn\u2019t usually happen, except for\nthe trivial kind of example given above.\n\nThe Feynman path integral was constructed as part of a re-formulation of\nby Richard Feynman, based on the sum-over-histories postulate of quantum\nmechanics, and can be thought of as an adaptation of Green\u2019s function\nmethods for solving initial/boundary value problems. No appropriate\nmeasure has been found for this integral and attempts at pseudomeasures\nhave given mixed results.\n\n[**Remark:**]{} Note however that in solving quantum field theory\nproblems one attacks the problem in the Feynman approach by \u2018dividing\u2019\nit *via* Feynman diagrams that are directly related to specific quantum\ninteractions; adding the contributions from such Feynman diagrams leads\nto high precision approximations to the final physical solution which is\nfinite and physically meaningful, or observable.\n\n[2]{} Hui-Hsiung Kuo, [*Introduction to Stochastic Integration*]{}.
