[@MJP1999]).\n\nThe $CW$-complex specified in the is constructed as the colimit\n$\\Gamma X$ of a sequence of cellular inclusions of $CW$-complexes\n$X_1, ..., X_n$ , so that one obtains $X \\equiv colim  [X_i]$. As a\nconsequence of J.H.C. Whitehead\u2019s Theorem, one also has that:\n\n$\\gamma* : [\\Gamma X,\\Gamma Y] \\longrightarrow[\\Gamma X, Y]$ is an\nisomorphism.\n\nFurthermore, the homotopy groups of the $CW$-complex $\\Gamma X$ are the\ncolimits of the homotopy groups of $X_n$ and\n$\\gamma_{n+1} : \\pi_q(X_{n+1})\\longmapsto\\pi_q (X)$ is a group\nepimorphism.\n\n[9]{}\n\nMay, J.P. 1999, *A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology.*, The\nUniversity of Chicago Press: Chicago",
