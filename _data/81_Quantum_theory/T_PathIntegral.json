  "definition": "The *path integral* is a generalization of the integral that is very\nuseful in theoretical and applied physics. Consider a vector field\n$\\vec{F}\\!:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^m$ and a\n$\\gamma\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. The path integral of $\\vec{F}$ along the\npath $\\gamma$ is defined as a definite integral. It can be constructed\nto be the Riemann sum of the values of $\\vec{F}$ along the curve\n$\\gamma$. Thusly, it is defined in terms of the parametrization of\n$\\gamma$, mapped into the domain $\\mathbb{R}^n$ of $\\vec{F}$.\nAnalytically,\n$$\\int_\\gamma \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{x} = \\int_a^b \\vec{F}(\\vec{\\gamma}(t))\\cdot d\\vec{x}$$\nwhere $\\vec{\\gamma}(a), \\vec{\\gamma}(b)$ are elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\nand $d\\vec{x}=\\langle\\frac{dx_1}{dt},\\cdots,\\frac{dx_n}{dt}\\rangle dt$\nwhere each $x_i$ is parametrized into a function of $t$.\\\n**Proof and existence of path integral:**\\\nAssume we have a parametrized curve $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)$ with $t\\in[a,b]$.\nWe want to construct a sum of $\\vec{F}$ over this interval on the curve\n$\\gamma$. Split the interval $[a,\\,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of size\n$\\Delta t=(b-a)/n$. Note that the arc lengths need not be of equal\nlength, though the intervals are of equal size. Let $t_i$ be an element\nof the $i$th subinterval. The quantity $|\\vec{\\gamma}'(t_i)|$ gives the\naverage magnitude of the vector tangent to the curve at a point in the\ninterval $\\Delta t$. $|\\vec{\\gamma}'(t_i)|\\Delta t$ is then the\napproximate arc length of the curve segment produced by the subinterval\n$\\Delta t$. Since we want to sum $\\vec{F}$ over our curve\n$\\vec{\\gamma}$, we let the range of our curve equal the domain of\n$\\vec{F}$. We can then dot this vector with our tangent vector to get\nthe approximation to $\\vec{F}$ at the point $\\vec{\\gamma}(t_i)$. Thus,\nto get the sum we want, we can take the limit as $\\Delta t$ approaches\n0.\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0}\\sum_a^b \\vec{F}(\\vec{\\gamma}(t_i))\\cdot\\vec{\\gamma}'(t_i)\\Delta t$$\nThis is a Riemann sum, and thus we can write it in integral form. This\nintegral is known as a path or line integral (the older name).\n$$\\int_\\gamma \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{x} = \\int_a^b \\vec{F}(\\vec{\\gamma}(t))\\cdot\\vec{\\gamma}'(t)dt$$\nNote that the path integral only exists if the definite integral exists\non the interval $[a,\\,b]$.\\\n**Properties:**\\\nA path integral that begins and ends at the same point is called a\nclosed path integral, and is denoted with the summa symbol with a\ncentered circle: $\\oint$. These types of path integrals can also be\nevaluated using Green\u2019s theorem.\\\nAnother property of path integrals is that the directed path integral on\na path $\\Gamma$ in a vector field is equal to the negative of the path\nintegral in the opposite direction along the same path. A directed path\nintegral on a closed path is denoted by summa and a circle with an arrow\ndenoting direction.\\\n**Visualization Aids:**\n\n![image](pintegral){width=\"3.65in\" height=\"3.65in\"}\n\nThis is an image of a path $\\gamma$ superimposed on a vector field\n$\\vec{F}$.\n\n![image](bootleg){width=\"4in\" height=\"3in\"}\n\nThis is a visualization of what we are doing when we take the integral\nunder the curve $S:P\\rightarrow\\vec{F}$.",
