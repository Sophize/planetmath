  "definition": "Suppose that $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ is a CR submanifold. If the CR\ndimension of $M$ is 0, we say that $M$ is [*totally real*]{}. If in\naddition $M$ is , then $M$ is said to be [*maximally totally real*]{}\n(or sometimes just [*maximally real*]{}).\n\nNote that if $M$ is maximally totally real, then the real dimension is\nautomatically $N$, this is because $T_x^c(M) = T_x(M) \\cap JT_x(M)$ (the\ncomplex tangent space) is of dimension 0, and thus $T_x(M)$ must be of\nreal dimension $N$ if $M$ is to be a generic manifold.\n\n[9]{} M.
