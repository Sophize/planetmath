For every $z \\in M$, the the stalk ${\\mathcal{F}}_z$ is generated\nas an ${\\mathcal{O}}_z$ module by the germs at $z$ of the\n$\\Gamma(M,\\mathcal{F})$.\n\nPhilosophically, this theorem says that there is good supply of of a\ncoherent analytic sheaf on a Stein manifold.\n\n[9]{} Lars H\u00f6rmander.
