  "definition": "For what follows suppose that $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}$ is a region. We\nwish to take the set of all holomorphic functions on $G$, denoted by\n${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$, and make it into a metric space. We will define a\nmetric such that convergence in this metric is the same as uniform\nconvergence on compact subsets of $G$. We will call this the [*space of\nanalytic functions*]{} on $G$.\n\nIt is known that there exists a sequence of compact subsets\n$K_n \\subset G$ such that $K_n \\subset\nK_{n+1}^\\circ$ (interior of $K_{n+1}$), such that\n$\\bigcup K_n^\\circ = G$ and such that if $K$ is any compact subset of\n$G$, then $K \\subset K_n$ for some $n$. Now define the quantity\n$\\rho_n(f,g)$ for $f,g \\in {\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ as\n$$\\rho_n(f,g) := \\sup_{z \\in K_n} \\{ \\lvert f(z) - g(z) \\rvert \\} .$$ We\ndefine the metric on ${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ as\n$$d(f,g) := \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n\\frac{\\rho_n(f,g)}{1+\\rho_n(f,g)} .$$ This can be shown to be a metric.\nFurthermore, it can be shown that the topology generated by this metric\nis independent of the choice of $K_n$, even though the actual values of\nthe metric do depend on the particular $K_n$ we have chosen. Finally, it\ncan be shown that convergence in $d$ is the same as uniform convergence\non compact subsets. It is known that if you have a sequence of analytic\nfunctions on $G$ that converge uniformly on compact subsets, then the\nlimit is in fact analytic in $G$, and thus ${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ is a\ncomplete space.\n\nSimilarly, we can treat the functions that are meromorphic on $G$, and\ndefine $M(G)$ to be the [*space of meromorphic functions*]{} on $G$. We\nassume that the functions take the value $\\infty$ at their poles, so\nthat they are defined at every point of $G$. That is, they take their\nvalues in the Riemann sphere, or the extended complex plane. We just\nneed to replace the definition of $\\rho_n(f,g)$ with\n$$\\rho_n(f,g) := \\sup_{z \\in K_n} \\{ \\sigma (f(z), g(z)) \\} ,$$ where\n$\\sigma$ is either the spherical metric on the Riemann sphere, or\nalternatively the metric induced by embedding the Riemann sphere in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. Both of those metrics produce the same topology, and\nthat is all that we care about. The rest of the definition is the same\nas that of ${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$. There is, however, one small glitch here.\n$M(G)$ is not a complete metric space. It is possible that functions in\n$M(G)$ go off to infinity pointwise, but this is the worst that can\nhappen. For example, the sequence $f_n(z) = n$ is a sequence of\nmeromorphic functions on $G$, and this sequence is Cauchy in $M(G)$, but\nthe limit would be $f(z) = \\infty$ and that is not a function in $M(G)$.\n\nNote that ${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ is sometimes denoted by $H(G)$ in\nliterature. Also note that $A(G)$ is usually reserved for functions\nwhich are analytic on $G$ and continuous on $\\bar{G}$ (closure of $G$).\n\nWe can similarly define the space of continuous functions, and treat\n${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ and $M(G)$ as subspaces of that. That is,\n${\\mathcal{O}}(G)$ would be a subspace of $C(G,{\\mathbb{C}})$ and $M(G)$\nwould be a subspace of $C(G,\\hat{\\mathbb{C}})$.\n\n[9]{} John\u00a0B. Conway. [**]{}.
