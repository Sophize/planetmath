  "definition": "Let $M$ be a complex manifold. Let $\\mathcal{O}$ be the sheaf of germs\nof analytic functions (which is a sheaf of rings) and let $\\mathcal{F}$\nbe a sheaf of $\\mathcal{O}$-modules. $\\mathcal{F}$ is then called an\n*analytic sheaf*.\n\nSuppose $X$ is an analytic vector bundle over $M$. Then the sheaf of\ngerms of analytic sections of $X$ is an analytic sheaf.\n\nThe sheaf of germs of meromorphic functions on $M$ is an analytic sheaf.\n\n[9]{} Lars H\u00f6rmander.
