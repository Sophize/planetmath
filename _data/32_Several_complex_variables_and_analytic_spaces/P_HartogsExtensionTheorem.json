  "statement": "Suppose $V$ is an analytic variety in an open set\n$U \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ ($n \\geq 2$) of dimension at most $n-2$ and\nsuppose that $f \\colon U \\backslash V \\to\n{\\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic. Then there exists a unique holomorphic\nextention of $f$ to all of $U$.\n\nNote that when $V$ is 0 dimensional (a point) then this is just a\nspecial case of the Hartogs\u2019 phenomenon. Also note the similarity to\nRiemann\u2019s removable singularity theorem in several variables, where\nhowever we also assume that $f$ is locally bounded.\n\n[9]{} Steven\u00a0G. Krantz.
