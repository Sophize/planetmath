  "definition": "Let $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a CR submanifold and let $f$ be a\n$C^k(M)$ ($k$ times continuously differentiable) function to\n${\\mathbb{C}}$ where $k \\geq 1$. Then $f$ is a [*CR function*]{} if for\nevery CR vector field $L$ on $M$ we have $Lf \\equiv 0$. A $f$ on $M$ is\ncalled a [*CR distribution*]{} if similarly every CR vector field\nannihilates $f$.\n\nFor example restrictions of holomorphic functions in ${\\mathbb{C}}^N$ to\n$M$ are CR functions. The converse is not always true and is not easy to\nsee. For example the following basic theorem is very useful when you\nhave real analytic submanifolds.\n\nLet $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a generic submanifold which is real\nanalytic (the defining function is real analytic). And let\n$f \\colon M \\to\n{\\mathbb{C}}$ be a real analytic function. Then $f$ is a CR function if\nand only if $f$ is a restriction to $M$ of a holomorphic function\ndefined in an open neighbourhood of $M$ in ${\\mathbb{C}}^N$.\n\n[9]{} M.
