  "definition": "It is possible to define the exponential function and the natural\nlogarithm in terms of a limit of powers. In this entry, we shall present\nthese definitions after some background information and demonstrate the\nbasic properties of these functions from these definitions.\n\nTwo basic results which are needed to make this development possible are\nthe following:\n\nLet $x$ be a real number and let $n$ be an integer such that $n > 0$ and\n$n + x > 0$. Then $$\\left( {n + x \\over n} \\right)^n < \n\\left( {n + 1 + x \\over n + 1} \\right)^{n+1}.$$\n\nSuppose that $\\{s_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ is a sequence such that\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n s_n = 0$. Then $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \n(1 + s_n)^n = 1$,\n\nFor proofs, see the attachments. From them, we first conclude that a\nsequence converges.\n\nLet $x$ be any real number. Then the sequence\n$$\\left\\{ \\left( {n + x \\over n} \\right)^n \\right\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$$ is\nconvergent.\n\nThe foregoing results show that the limit in the following definition\nconverges, and hence defines a bona fide function.\n\nLet $x$ be a real number. Then we define\n$$\\exp (x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\n\\left( {n + x \\over n} \\right)^n .$$\n\nWe may now derive some of the chief properties of this function.\nstarting with the addition formula.\n\nFor any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have\n$\\exp (x+y) = \\exp(x) \\exp (y)$.\n\nSince $${n (n + x + y) \\over (n + x) (n + y)} =\n 1 - {xy \\over (n + x) (n + y)}$$ and\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} {n \\over (n + x) (n + y)} = 0 ,$$ theorem 2 above\nimplies that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\n \\left(\n  {n (n + x + y) \\over (n + x) (n + y)}\n \\right)^n = 1 .$$ Since it permissible to multiply convergent sequences\ntermwise, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\exp (x) \\exp (y) &=\n \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( {n + x \\over n} \\right)^n\n                     \\left( {n + y \\over n} \\right)^n\n                     \\left(\n                      {n (n + x + y) \\over (n + x) (n + y)}\n                     \\right)^n \\\\ &=\n \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( {n + x + y \\over n} \\right)^n = \n \\exp (x+y)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe function $\\exp$ is strictly increasing.\n\nSuppose that $x$ is a strictly positive real number. By theorem 1 and\nthe definition of the exponential as a limit, we have\n$1 + x < \\exp (x)$, so we conclude that $0 < x$ implies $1 < \\exp (x)$.\n\nNow, suppose that $x$ and $y$ are two real numbers with $x > y$. Since\n$x - y > 0$, we have $\\exp (x-y) > 1$. Using theorem 4, we have\n$\\exp (x) \n= \\exp (x-y) \\exp (y) > \\exp (y)$, so the function is strictly\nincreasing.\n\nThe function $\\exp$ is continuous.\n\nSuppose that $0 < x < 1$. By theorem 1 and the definition of the\nexponential as a limit, we have $1 - x < \\exp (-x)$ and\n$1 + x < \\exp (x)$. By theorem 4, $\\exp (x) \\exp (-x) = \\exp (0) = 0$.\nHence, we have the bounds $1 + x < \\exp (x)\n< 1/(1-x)$ and $1-x < \\exp (-x) < 1/(1+x)$. From the former bound, we\nconclude that $\\lim_{x \\to 0-} \\exp (x) = 1$ and, from the latter, that\n$\\lim_{x \\to 0+} \n\\exp (x) = 1$, so $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\exp (x) = 1$.\n\nSuppose that $y$ is any real number. By theorem 4,\n$\\exp (x + y) = \\exp (x)\n\\exp (y)$. Hence, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\exp (x + y) = \\exp (y) \\lim_{x \\to 0}\n\\exp (x) = \\exp (y)$. In other words, for all real $y$, we have\n$\\lim_{ x\n\\to y} \\exp (x) = \\exp (y)$, so the exponential function is continuous.\n\nThe function $\\exp$ is one-to-one and maps onto the positive real axis.\n\nThe one-to-one property follows readily from monotonicity \u2014 if\n$\\exp (x) =\n\\exp (y)$, then we must have $x = y$, because otherwise, either $x < y$\nor $x > y$, which would imply $\\exp (x) < \\exp (y)$ or\n$\\exp (x) > \\exp (y)$, respectively. Next, suppose that $x$ is a real\nnumber greater than $1$. By theorem 1 and the definition of the\nexponential as a limit, we have $1 + x < \\exp (x)$. Thus,\n$1 < x < \\exp (x)$; since $\\exp$ is continuous, the intermediate value\ntheorem asserts that there must exist a real number $y$ between $0$ and\n$x$ such that $\\exp (y) = x$. If, instead, $0 < x < 1$, then $1/x > 1$\nso we have a real number $y$ such that $\\exp (y)\n= 1/x$. By theorem 4, we then have $\\exp (-y) = x$. So, given any real\nnumber $x > 0$, there exists a real number $y$ such that $\\exp (y) = x$,\nhence the function maps onto the positive real axis.\n\nThe function $\\exp$ is convex.\n\nSince the function is already known to be continuous, it suffices to\nshow that $\\exp ((x + y)/2) \\le (\\exp(x) + \\exp (y))/2$ for all real\nnumbers $x$ and $y$. Changing variables, this is equivalent to showing\nthat $2 \\exp\n(a + b) \\le \\exp (a) + \\exp (a + 2b)$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.\nBy theorem 4, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\exp (a + b) &= \\exp (a) \\exp (b) \\\\\n \\exp (a + 2b) &= \\exp (a) \\exp (b)^2 .\\end{aligned}$$ Using the\ninequality $2x \\le 1 + x^2$ with $x = \\exp (b)$ and multiplying by\n$\\exp (a)$, we conclude that\n$2 \\exp (a + b) \\le \\exp (a) + \\exp (a + 2b)$, hence the exponential\nfunction is convex.\n\nDefining the constant $e$ as $\\exp (1)$, we find that the exponential\nfunction gives powers of this number.\n\nFor every real number $x$, we have $\\exp (x) = e^x$.\n\nApplying an induction argument to theorem 4, it can be shown that\n$\\exp (nx) =\n\\exp(x)^n$ for every real number $x$ and every integer $n$. Hence, given\na rational number $m/n$, we have\n$\\exp (m/n)^n = \\exp (m) = \\exp(1)^m = e^m$. Thus, $exp(m/n) = e^{m/n}$\nso we see that $\\exp (x) = e^x$ when $x$ is a rational number. By\ncontinuity, it follows that $\\exp (x) = e^x$ for every real number $x$.",
