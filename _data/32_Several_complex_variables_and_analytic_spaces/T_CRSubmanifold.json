  "definition": "Suppose that $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ is a real submanifold of real\ndimension $n.$ Take $p \\in M,$ then let $T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N)$ be the\ntangent vectors of ${\\mathbb{C}}^N$ at the point $p.$ If we identify\n${\\mathbb{C}}^N$ with ${\\mathbb{R}}^{2N}$ by $z_j = x_j + i y_j,$ we can\ntake the following vectors as our basis\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p,\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p,\n\\ldots,\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_N} \\Bigg\\rvert_p,\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_N} \\Bigg\\rvert_p .$$\n\nWe define a real linear mapping\n$J\\colon T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N) \\to T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N)$ such that for any\n$1 \\leq j \\leq N$ we have $$J \\left(\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p\n\\right)\n= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p\n\\qquad \\text{ and }\nJ \\left(\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p\n\\right)\n= - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\Bigg\\rvert_p .$$ Where $J$ is\nreferred to as the complex structure on $T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N).$ Note that\n$J^2 = -I,$ that is applying $J$ twice we just negate the vector.\n\nLet $T_p(M)$ be the tangent space of $M$ at the point $p$ (that is,\nthose vectors of $T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N)$ which are tangent to $M$).\n\nThe subspace $T_p^c(M)$ defined as\n$$T_p^c(M) := \\{ X \\in T_p(M) \\mid J(X) \\in T_p(M) \\}$$ is called the\n[*complex tangent space*]{} of $M$ at the point $p,$ and if the\ndimension of $T_p(M)$ is constant for all $p \\in M$ then the\ncorresponding vector bundle $T^c(M) := \\bigcup_{p\\in M} T_p^c(M)$ is\ncalled the [*complex bundle*]{} of $M$.\n\nDo note that the complex tangent space is a real (not complex) vector\nspace, despite its rather unfortunate name.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb{C}} T_p(M)$ and ${\\mathbb{C}} T_p({\\mathbb{C}}^N)$ be the\ncomplexified vector spaces, by just allowing the coefficents of the\nvectors to be complex numbers. That is for\n$X = \\sum a_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\Big\\rvert_p + b_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\Big\\rvert_p$\nwe allow $a_j$ and $b_j$ to be complex numbers. Next we can extend the\nmapping $J$ to be ${\\mathbb{C}}$-linear on these new vector spaces and\nstill get that $J^2 = -I$ as before. We notice that the operator $J$ has\ntwo eigenvalues, $i$ and $-i$.\n\nLet ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ be the eigenspace of ${\\mathbb{C}} T_p(M)$\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue $-i.$ That is\n$${\\mathcal{V}}_p := \\{ X \\in {\\mathbb{C}} T_p(M) \\mid J(X) = -iX \\} .$$\nIf the dimension of ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ is constant for all $p \\in M,$\nthen we get a corresponding vector bundle ${\\mathcal{V}}$ which we call\nthe [*CR bundle*]{} of $M.$ A smooth section of the CR bundle is then\ncalled a [*CR vector field*]{}.\n\nThe submanifold $M$ is called a [*CR submanifold*]{} (or just [*CR\nmanifold*]{}) if the dimension of ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ is constant for all\n$p \\in M.$ The complex dimension of ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ will then be\ncalled the [*CR dimension*]{} of $M.$\n\nAn example of a CR submanifold is for example a hyperplane defined by\n$\\operatorname{Im} z_N = 0$ where the CR dimension is $N-1.$ Another\nless trivial example is the Lewy hypersurface.\n\nNote that sometimes ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ is written as $T_p^{0,1} (M)$ and\nreferred to as the [*space of antiholomorphic vectors*]{}, where an\n[*antiholomorphic vector*]{} is a tangent vector which can be written in\nterms of the basis\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_j} \\Bigg\\rvert_p := \n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\left(\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\Bigg\\rvert_p + i\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_j} \\Bigg\\rvert_p\n\\right) .$$\n\nThe CR in the name refers to Cauchy-Riemann and that is because the\nvector space ${\\mathcal{V}}_p$ corresponds to differentiating with\nrespect to $\\bar{z}_j.$\n\n[9]{} M.
