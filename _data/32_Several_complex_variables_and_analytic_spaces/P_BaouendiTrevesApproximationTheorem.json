  "statement": "Suppose $M$ is a real smooth manifold. Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be a subbundle\nof the complexified tangent space $\\mathbb{C} TM$ (that is\n$\\mathbb{C} \\otimes TM$). Let $n = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{V}$ and\n$d = \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} M .$ We will say that $\\mathcal{V}$ is\n*integrable*, if it is integrable in the following sense. Suppose that\nfor any point $p \\in M,$ there exist $m = d-n$ smooth complex valued\nfunctions $z_1,\\ldots,z_m$ defined in a neighbourhood of $p$, such that\nthe differentials $dz_1,\\ldots,dz_m$ are $\\mathbb{C}$-linearly\nindependent and for all sections $L \\in \\Gamma(M,\\mathcal{V})$ we have\n$Lz_k = 0$ for $k = 1,\\ldots,m.$ We say $z=(z_1,\\ldots,z_m)$ are ** near\n$p.$\n\nWe say $f$ is a ** if $Lf = 0$ for every $L \\in \\Gamma(M,\\mathcal{V})$\nin the sense of distributions (or classically if $f$ is in fact smooth).\n\nSuppose $M$ is a smooth manifold of real dimension $d$ and $\\mathcal{V}$\nan integrable subbundle as above. Let $p \\in M$ be fixed and let\n$z=(z_1,\\ldots,z_m)$ be basic solutions near $p$. Then there exists a\ncompact neighbourhood $K$ of $p$, such that for any continuous solution\n$f \\colon M \\to \\mathbb{C},$ there exists a sequence $p_j$ of\npolynomials in $m$ variables with complex coefficients such that\n$$p_j(z_1,\\ldots,z_m) \\to f\n\\text{ ~~~~ uniformly in $K.$}$$\n\nIn particular we have the following corollary for CR submanifolds. A\nreal smooth CR submanifold that is embedded in ${\\mathbb{C}}^N$ has the\nCR vector fields as the integrable subbundle $\\mathcal{V}$. Also the\ncoordinate functions $z_1,\\ldots,z_N$ can be taken as the basic\nsolutions. We will require that $M$ be a generic submanifold rather than\njust any CR submanifold to make sure that ${\\mathbb{C}}^N$ is of the\nminimal dimension.\n\nLet $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be an embedded real smooth generic\nsubmanifold and $p \\in M$. Then there exists a compact neighbourhood\n$K \\subset M$ of $p$ such that any continuous CR function $f$ is\nuniformly approximated on $K$ by polynomials in $N$ variables.\n\nThis result can be used to extend CR functions from CR submanifolds. For\nexample, if we can fill a certain set with analytic discs attached to\n$M$, we can approximate $f$ on $K \\subset M$ and by the maximum\nprinciple we will be able to use the fact that uniform limits of\nholomorphic functions (in this case polynomials) are holomorphic. A key\npoint is that while $K$ is not arbitrary, it does not depend on $f$, it\nonly depends on $M$ and $p$.\n\nSuppose $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^2$ is given in coordinates $(z,w)$ by\n$\\operatorname{Im} w = \\lvert z \\rvert^2 .$ Note that for some $t > 0,$\nthe map $\\xi \\mapsto (t \\xi, t)$ is an attached analytic disc. By taking\ndifferent $t > 0,$ we can fill the set\n$\\{ (z,w) \\mid \\operatorname{Im} w \\geq \\lvert z \\rvert^2 \\}$ by\nanalytic discs attached to $M.$ If $f$ is a continuous CR function on\n$M$, then there exists some compact neighbourhood $K$ of $(0,0)$ such\nthat $f$ is uniformly approximated on $K$ by holomorphic polynomials. By\nmaximum principle we get that this sequence of holomorphic polynomials\nconverges uniformly on all the discs for $t < \\epsilon$ for some\n$\\epsilon > 0$ (such that the boundary of the disc lies in $K$). Hence\n$f$ extends to a holomorphic function on\n$\\epsilon > \\operatorname{Im} w > \\lvert z \\rvert^2$, and which is\ncontinuous on $\\epsilon > \\operatorname{Im} w \\geq \\lvert z \\rvert^2$.\n\nUsing methods of the example it is possible (among many other results)\nto prove the following.\n\nSuppose $M \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a smooth strongly pseudoconvex\nhypersurface and $f$ a continuous CR function on $M.$ Then $f$ extends\nto a small neighbourhood on the pseudoconvex side of $M$ as a\nholomorphic function.\n\nUsing the above corollary we can prove the Hartogs phenomenon for\nhypersurfaces by reducing to the standard Hartogs phenomenon (although\nthe theorem also holds without pseudoconvexity with a different proof).\n\nLet $U \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a domain with smooth strongly\npseudoconvex boundary. Suppose $f$ is a continuous CR function on\n$\\partial U$. Then there exists a function $f$ holomorphic in $U$ and\ncontinuous on $\\bar{U},$ such that $F|_{\\partial U} = f .$\n\n[9]{} M.
