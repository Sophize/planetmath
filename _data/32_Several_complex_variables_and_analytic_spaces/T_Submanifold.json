  "definition": "There are several conflicting definitions of what a submanifold is,\ndepending on which author you are reading. All that agrees is that a\nsubmanifold is a subset of a manifold which is itself a manifold,\nhowever how structure is inherited from the ambient space is not\ngenerally agreed upon. So let\u2019s start with differentiable submanifolds\nof ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ as that\u2019s the most useful case.\n\nLet $M$ be a subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ such that for every point\n$p \\in M$ there exists a neighbourhood $U_p$ of $p$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$\nand $m$ continuously differentiable functions\n$\\rho_k \\colon U \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ where the differentials of $\\rho_k$\nare linearly independent, such that\n$$M \\cap U = \\{ x \\in U \\mid \\rho_k(x) = 0 , 1 \\leq k \\leq m \\} .$$ Then\n$M$ is called a [*submanifold*]{} of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ of dimension $m$\nand of codimension $n-m$.\n\nIf $\\rho_k$ are in fact smooth then $M$ is a [*smooth submanifold*]{}\nand similarly if $\\rho$ is real analytic then $M$ is a [*real analytic\nsubmanifold*]{}. If we identify ${\\mathbb{R}}^{2n}$ with\n${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ and we have a submanifold there it is called a [*real\nsubmanifold*]{} in ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$. $\\rho_k$ are usually called the\n[*local defining functions*]{}.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at a more general definition. Let $M$ be a manifold of\ndimension $m$. A subset $N \\subset M$ is said to have the [*submanifold\nproperty*]{} if there exists an integer $n \\leq m$, such that for each\n$p \\in N$ there is a coordinate neighbourhood $U$ and a coordinate\nfunction $\\varphi \\colon U \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^m$ of $M$ such that\n$\\varphi(p) = (0,0,0,\\ldots,0)$,\n$\\varphi(U \\cap N) = \\{ x \\in \\varphi(U) \\mid x_{n+1} = x_{n+2} = \\ldots = x_m = 0 \\}$\nif $n < m$ or $N \\cap U = U$ if $n=m$.\n\nLet $M$ be a manifold of dimension $m$. A subset $N \\subset M$ with the\nsubmanifold property for some $n \\leq m$ is called a [*submanifold*]{}\nof $M$ of dimension $n$ and of codimension $m-n$.\n\nThe ambiguity arises about what topology we require $N$ to have. Some\nauthors require $N$ to have the relative topology inherited from $M$,\nothers don\u2019t.\n\nOne could also mean that a subset is a submanifold if it is a disjoint\nunion of submanifolds of different dimensions. It is not hard to see\nthat if $N$ is connected this is not an issue (whatever the topology on\n$N$ is).\n\nIn case of differentiable manifolds, if we take $N$ to be a subspace of\n$M$ (the topology on $N$ is the relative topology inherited from $M$)\nand the differentiable structure of $N$ to be the one determined by the\ncoordinate neighbourhoods above then we call $N$ a [*regular\nsubmanifold*]{}.\n\nIf $N$ is a submanifold and the inclusion map $i \\colon N \\to M$ is an\nimbedding, then we say that $N$ is an [*imbedded*]{} (or [*embedded*]{})\n[*submanifold*]{} of $M$.\n\nLet $p \\in M$ where $M$ is a manifold. Then the equivalence class of all\nsubmanifolds $N \\subset M$ such that $p \\in N$ where we say $N_1$ is\nequivalent to $N_2$ if there is some open neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ such\nthat $N_1 \\cap U = N_2 \\cap U$ is called the [*germ of a submanifold*]{}\nthrough the point $p$.\n\nIf $N \\subset M$ is an open subset of $M$, then $N$ is called the [*open\nsubmanifold*]{} of $M$. This is the easiest class of examples of\nsubmanifolds.\n\nExample of a submanifold (a in fact) is the unit sphere in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. This is in fact a hypersurface as it is of codimension\n1.\n\n[9]{} William M. Boothby. [**]{}, Academic Press, San Diego, California,\n2003. M.
