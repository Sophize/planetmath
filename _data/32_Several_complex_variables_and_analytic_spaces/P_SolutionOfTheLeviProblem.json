  "statement": "The [*Levi problem*]{} is the problem of characterizing domains of\nholomorphy by a local condition on the boundary that does not involve\nholomorphic functions themselves. This condition turned out to be\npseudoconvexity.\n\nAn open set $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ is a domain of holomorphy if and\nonly if $G$ is pseudoconvex.\n\nThe forward direction (domain of holomorphy implies pseudoconvexity) is\nnot hard to prove and was known for a long time. The opposite direction\nis really what\u2019s called the solution to the Levi problem.\n\n[9]{} Steven\u00a0G. Krantz. [**]{}, AMS Chelsea Publishing, Providence,\nRhode Island, 1992.",
