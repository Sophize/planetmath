  "definition": "Let $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ be a (open connected subset) with $C^2$\nboundary, that is the boundary is locally the graph of a twice\ncontinuously differentiable function. Let\n$\\rho \\colon {\\mathbb{C}}^n \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be a defining function of\n$G$, that is $\\rho$ is a twice continuously differentiable function such\nthat $\\operatorname{grad} \\rho (z) \\not= 0$ for $z \\in \\partial G$ and\n$G =\n\\{ z \\in {\\mathbb{C}}^n \\mid \\rho(z) < 0 \\}$ (such a function always\nexists).\n\nLet $p \\in \\partial G$ (boundary of $G$). We call the space of vectors\n$w = (w_1,\\ldots,w_n) \\in {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ such that\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial z_k} (p) w_k = 0 ,$$ the\nspace of [*holomorphic tangent vectors*]{} at $p$ and denote it\n$T^{1,0}_p(\\partial G)$.\n\n$T^{1,0}_p(\\partial G)$ is an $n-1$ dimensional complex vector space and\nis a subspace of the complexified , that is\n${\\mathbb{C}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} T_p(\\partial G)$.\n\nNote that when $n=1$ then the complex tangent space contains just the\nzero vector.\n\nThe point $p \\in \\partial G$ is called [*Levi pseudoconvex*]{} (or just\n[*pseudoconvex*]{}) if $$\\sum_{j,k=1}^n\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z_j \\partial \\bar{z}_k} (p) w_j \\bar{w}_k\n\\geq 0 ,$$ for all $w \\in T^{1,0}_p(\\partial G)$. The point is called\n[*strongly Levi pseudoconvex*]{} (or just [*strongly pseudoconvex*]{} or\nalso [*strictly pseudoconvex*]{}) if the inequality above is strict. The\nexpression on the left is called the [*Levi form*]{}.\n\nNote that if a point is not strongly Levi pseudoconvex then it is\nsometimes called a [*weakly Levi pseudoconvex*]{} point.\n\nThe Levi form really acts on an $n-1$ dimensional space, so the\nexpression above may be confusing as it only acts on\n$T^{1,0}_p(\\partial G)$ and not on all of ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$.\n\nThe domain $G$ is called Levi pseudoconvex if every boundary point is\nLevi pseudoconvex. Similarly $G$ is called strongly Levi pseudoconvex if\nevery boundary point is strongly Levi pseudoconvex.\n\nNote that in particular all convex domains are pseudoconvex.\n\nIt turns out that $G$ with $C^2$ boundary is a domain of holomorphy if\nand only if $G$ is Levi pseudoconvex.\n\n[9]{} M.
