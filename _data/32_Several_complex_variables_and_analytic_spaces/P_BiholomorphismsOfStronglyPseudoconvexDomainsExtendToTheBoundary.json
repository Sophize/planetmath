  "statement": "It is a basic question in complex analysis to ask when does a\nbiholomorphic mapping of two domains extend to the boundary. The\nfollowing is a celebrated theorem of Fefferman for strongly pseudoconvex\ndomains.\n\nLet $U, V \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n$ ($n \\geq 2$) be two strongly\npseudoconvex domains with smooth ($C^\\infty$) boundaries (the boundaries\nare smooth submanifolds). Let $f \\colon U \\to V$ be a biholomorphism.\nThen $f$ extends to a smooth diffeomorphism of $\\bar{U}$ to $\\bar{V}$.\n\n[9]{} Fefferman, Charles. [**]{}. Invent. Math.
