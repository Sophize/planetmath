  "definition": "The Riemann sphere, denoted $\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}$, is the one-point\ncompactification of the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$, obtained by\nidentifying the limits of all infinitely extending rays from the origin\nas one single \u201cpoint at infinity.\u201d Heuristically, $\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}$ can\nbe viewed as a 2-sphere with the top point corresponding to the point at\ninfinity, and the bottom point corresponding the origin. An atlas for\nthe Riemann sphere is given by two charts: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}\\backslash\\{\\infty\\}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}:z\\mapsto z\\end{aligned}$$\nand $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}\\backslash\\{0\\}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}:z\\mapsto \\frac{1}{z}\\end{aligned}$$\nAny rational function on $\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}$ has a unique smooth\nextension to a map\n$\\hat{p}:\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}\\rightarrow\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}$.\\\nConcretely, the bijective correspondence of the points of the closed\ncomplex plane and the Riemann sphere is implemented by the stereographic\nprojection. Think a sphere of radius $R$ being above the complex plane\nand having it as tangent plane with the origin as the point of tangency.\nCall this point the South Pole and the opposite point $N$ of the sphere\nthe North Pole. For an arbitrary point $P$ of the complex plane, set the\nline through it and $N$. The line intersects the sphere in another point\n$P'$. The mapping $$\\begin{aligned}\nP \\mapsto P'\\end{aligned}$$ is a bijection between the closed complex\nplane and the sphere. Especially, the origin is mapped onto the South\nPole and $\\infty$ onto the North Pole.\n\n(-6,-4)(7.5,3) (0,0) (0,1.98) (0,2.3)[$N$]{} (4.3,-3.1)[$P$]{}\n(1.2,1.1)[$P'$]{} (0,0)[2.04]{} (-5.5,-3)(4,-3) (4,-3)(6.5,-1)\n(-5.5,-3)(-3,-1) (-3,-1)(-1.73,-1) (1.73,-1)(2.3,-1) (2.5,-1)(6.5,-1)\n(-1.2,-3)(0,-2) (0,2)(0.89,0.89) (0.89,0.89)(4,-3) (4,-3) (0.89,0.89)\n(-6,-4)[.]{} (7.4,3)[.]{}\n\nIf we equip the sphere with [*geographic coordinates*]{}, the\n[*longitude*]{} $\\lambda$ ($-\\pi < \\lambda \\leqq \\pi$) and the\n[*latitude*]{} $\\varphi$\n($-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leqq \\varphi \\leqq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$) and fix that the\npoints of the positive real axis are mapped onto the zero meridian\n$\\lambda = 0$, then the polar coordinates (argument and modulus)\n$\\theta$ and $r$ of $P$ in the mapping (1) are with the geographic\ncoordinates of $P'$ by the equations\n$$\\theta \\;\\equiv\\; \\lambda \\!\\pmod{2\\pi}, \\quad r \\;=\\; 2R\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\varphi}{2}+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right),$$\nas is easily checked.
