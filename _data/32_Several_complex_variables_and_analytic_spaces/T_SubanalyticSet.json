  "definition": "Let $U \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Suppose $\\mathcal{A}(U)$ is any ring of\nreal valued functions on $U$. Define $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{A}(U))$ to be\nthe smallest set of subsets of $U$, which contain the sets\n$\\{ x\\in U \\mid f(x) > 0 \\}$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(U)$, and is\nclosed under finite union, finite intersection and complement.\n\nA set $V \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is [*semianalytic*]{} if and only if\nfor each $x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of\n$x$, such that $V \\cap U \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{O}(U))$, where\n$\\mathcal{O}(U)$ denotes the real-analytic real valued functions.\n\nUnlike for semialgebraic sets, there is no Tarski-Seidenberg theorem for\nsemianalytic sets, and projections of semianalytic sets are in general\nnot semianalytic.\n\nWe say $V \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is a [*subanalytic*]{} set if for each\n$x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, there exists a relatively compact semianalytic\nset $X \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^{n+m}$ and a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, such\nthat $V \\cap U$ is the projection of $X$ onto the first $n$ coordinates.\n\nIn particular all semianalytic sets are subanalytic. On an open dense\nset subanalytic sets are submanifolds and hence we can define dimension.\nHence at a point $p$, where a set $A$ is a submanifold, the dimension\n$\\dim_p A$ is the dimension of the submanifold. The [*dimension*]{} of\nthe subanalytic set is the maximum $\\dim_p A$ for all $p$ where $A$ is a\nsubmanifold. Semianalytic sets are contained in a real-analytic\nsubvariety of the same dimension. However, subanalytic sets are not in\ngeneral contained in any subvariety of the same dimension. We do have\nhowever the following.\n\nA subanalytic set $A$ can be written as a locally finite union of\nsubmanifolds.\n\nThe set of subanalytic sets is still not completely closed under\nprojections however. Note that a real-analytic subvariety that is not\nrelatively compact can have a projection which is not a locally finite\nunion of submanifolds, and hence is not subanalytic.\n\nLet $U \\subset {\\mathbb{R}}^n$. A mapping\n$f \\colon U \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^m$ is said to be subanalytic (resp.\nsemianalytic) if the graph of $f$ (i.e. the set\n$\\{ (x,y) \\in U \\times {\\mathbb{R}}^m ~\\mid~\nx, y=f(x) \\}$) is subanalytic (resp. semianalytic)\n\n[9]{} Edward Bierstone and Pierre\u00a0D.
