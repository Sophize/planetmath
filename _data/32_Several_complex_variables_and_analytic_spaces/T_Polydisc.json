  "definition": "We denote the set\n$$D^n(z,r) := \\{ w \\in {\\mathbb{C}}^n \\mid \\lvert z_k - w_k \\rvert < r\n\\text{ for all } k = 1,\\ldots,n \\}$$ an [*open polydisc*]{}. We can also\nhave [*polydiscs*]{} of the form\n$$D^1(z_1,r_1) \\times \\ldots \\times D^1(z_n,r_n) .$$ The set\n$\\partial D^1(z_1,r_1) \\times \\ldots \\times \\partial D^1(z_n,r_n)$ is\ncalled the [*distinguished boundary*]{} of the polydisc.\n\nBe careful not to confuse this with the open ball in ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$ as\nthat is defined as\n$$B(z,r) := \\{ w \\in {\\mathbb{C}}^n \\mid \\lvert z - w \\rvert < r \\} .$$\nWhen $n > 1$ then open balls and open polydiscs are not\nbiholomorphically equivalent (there is no 1-1 biholomorphic mapping\nbetween the two).\n\nIt is common to write $\\bar{D}^n(z,r)$ for the closure of the polydisc.\nBe careful with this notation however as some texts outside of complex\nanalysis use $D(x,r)$ and the \u201cdisc\u201d to represent a closed ball in two\nreal dimensions.\n\nAlso note that when $n=2$ the is sometimes used.\n\n[9]{} Lars H\u00f6rmander.
