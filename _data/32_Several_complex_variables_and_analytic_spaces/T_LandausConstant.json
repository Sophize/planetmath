For each $f\\in\\mathcal{F}$ let\n$\\lambda(f)$ be the supremum of all numbers $r$ such that there is a\ndisk $S\\subset D$ such that $f(S)$ contains a disk of radius $r$ (notice\nthat here we don\u2019t require $f$ to be injective on $S$).\n\nLandau\u2019s constant $L$ is defined by\n$$L=\\inf \\{ \\lambda(f) : f\\in \\mathcal{F}\\}.$$\n\nLet $B$ be Bloch\u2019s constant. Then, clearly, $L\\geq B$. The exact value\nof $L$ (as that of $B$) is not known but it has been shown that\n$0.5 \\leq L \\leq 0.56$. In particular, it is known that $L$ is strictly\ngreater than $B$.\n\n[00]{}\n\nJohn B. Conway, [*Functions of One Complex Variable I*]{}, Second\nEdition, 1978, Springer-Verlag, New York.",
