  "definition": "Let $G \\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^N$ be an open set.\n\nA set $V \\subset G$ is said to be [*locally analytic*]{} if for every\npoint $p \\in V$ there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ in $G$ and\nholomorphic functions $f_1,\\cdots,f_m$ defined in $U$ such that\n$U \\cap V = \\{ z : f_k(z) = 0 \\text{for all} 1\\leq k \\leq m \\}.$\n\nThis basically says that around each point of $V,$ the set $V$ is\nanalytic. A stronger definition is required.\n\nA set $V \\subset G$ is said to be an [*analytic variety*]{} in $G$ (or\n[*analytic set*]{} in $G$) if for every point $p \\in G$ there exists a\nneighbourhood $U$ of $p$ in $G$ and holomorphic functions\n$f_1,\\cdots,f_m$ defined in $U$ such that\n$U \\cap V = \\{ z : f_k(z) = 0 \\text{ for all } 1\\leq k \\leq m \\}.$\n\nNote the change, now $V$ is analytic around each point of $G.$ Since the\nzero sets of holomorphic functions are closed, this for example implies\nthat $V$ is relatively closed in $G,$ while a local variety need not be\nclosed. Sometimes an analytic variety is called an [*analytic set*]{}.\n\nAt most points an analytic variety $V$ will in fact be a complex\nanalytic manifold. So\n\nA point $p \\in V$ is called a [*regular point*]{} if there is a\nneighbourhood $U$ of $p$ such that $U \\cap V$ is a complex analytic\nmanifold. Any other point is called a [*singular point*]{}.\n\nThe set of regular points of $V$ is denoted by $V^-$ or sometimes $V^*.$\n\nFor any regular point $p \\in V$ we can define the dimension as\n$$\\operatorname{dim}_p(V) = \n\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(U \\cap V)$$ where $U$ is as above and\nthus $U \\cap V$ is a manifold with a well defined dimension. Here we of\ncourse take the complex dimension of these manifolds.\n\nLet $V$ be an analytic variety, we define the dimension of $V$ by\n$$\\operatorname{dim}(V)\n=\n\\sup \\{ \\operatorname{dim}_p(V) : p \\text{ a regular point of } V \\} .$$\n\nThe regular point $p \\in V$ such that $\\dim_p(V) = \\dim(V)$ is called a\n[*top point*]{} of $V$.\n\nSimilarly as for manifolds we can also talk about subvarieties. In this\ncase we modify definition a little bit.\n\nA set $W \\subset V$ where $V \\subset G$ is a local variety is said to be\na [*subvariety*]{} of $V$ if for every point $p \\in V$ there exists a\nneighbourhood $U$ of $p$ in $G$ and holomorphic functions\n$f_1,\\cdots,f_m$ defined in $U$ such that\n$U \\cap W = \\{ z : f_k(z) = 0 \\text{ for all } 1\\leq k \\leq m \\}$.\n\nThat is, a subset $W$ is a subvariety if it is definined by the\nvanishing of analytic functions near all points of $V$.\n\n[9]{} E.
