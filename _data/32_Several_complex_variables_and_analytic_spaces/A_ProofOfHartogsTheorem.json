  "argumentText": "\\[lemma1\\] Suppose that $g$ is a smooth differential $(0,1)$-form with\ncompact support in ${\\mathbb C}^n .$ Then there exists a smooth function\n$\\psi$ such that $$\\label{dbareq}\n\\bar{\\partial} \\psi = g ,$$ and $\\psi$ has compact support if\n$n \\geq 2.$\n\nLet $z = (z_1,\\ldots,z_n) \\in {\\mathbb C}^n$ be our coordinates. We note\nthat $(0,1)$-form means a differential form given by\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^n g_k(z) d \\bar{z}_k .$$ The operator $\\bar{\\partial}$ is\nthe so-called d-bar operator and we are looking for a smooth function\n$\\phi$ solving the equation inhomogeneous $\\bar{\\partial}$ equation. It\nis important that $g$ has compact support, otherwise solutions to are\nmuch harder to obtain.\n\nWritten out in detail we can think of $g$ as $n$ different functions\n$g_1,\\ldots,g_n,$ where are date $g_k$ satisfy the compatibility\ncondition $$\\frac{\\partial g_k}{\\partial \\bar{z}_l} =\n\\frac{\\partial g_l}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} \\text{ for all $k$, $l$}.$$ Then\nwe write equation as\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = g_k \\text{ for all $k$.}$$\nWe assume also that $g_k$ have compact support.\n\nThis system of equations has a solution (many equations in fact). We can\nobtain an explicit solution as follows. $$\\psi(z)\n=\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n g_1(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta} .$$ $\\psi$ is smooth by differentiating under\nthe integral. When $n \\geq 2,$ this solution will also have compact\nsupport since $g_1$ has compact support and as $z$ tends to infinity\n$(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)$ also tends to infinity no matter what $\\zeta$\nis. The reader should notice that there is one direction which does not\nwork. But if $\\psi$ has bounded support except for the line defined by\n$z_2 = z_3 = \\cdots = z_n = 0,$ then the support must be compact by\ncontinuity of $\\psi$. It should also be clear why $\\psi$ does not have\ncompact support if $n=1.$\n\nOne might be wondering why we picked $z_1$ and $g_1$ in the construction\nof $\\psi.$ It does not matter, we will get different solutions we we use\n$z_k$ and $g_k,$ but it will still have compact support. Further one\nmight wonder why we only use one part of the data, and still get an\nactual solution. The answer here is that the compatibility condition\nrelates all the data, so we only need to look at one.\n\nWe still must check that this really is a solution. We apply the\ncompatibility condition. Let $k \\geq 2$. $$\\begin{split}\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}(z_1,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n& =\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n \\frac{\\partial g_1}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta}\n\\\\\n& =\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n \\frac{\\partial g_k}{\\partial \\bar{z}_1}(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta} .\n\\end{split}$$ Note that the integral can be taken over a large ball $B$\nthat contains the support of $g_k$. We apply the generalized Cauchy\nformula, where the boundary part of the integral is obviously zero since\nit is over a set where $g_k$ is zero. $$\\begin{split}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n \\frac{\\partial g_k}{\\partial \\bar{z}_1}(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta}\n& =\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_B\n\\frac{\n \\frac{\\partial g_k}{\\partial \\bar{z}_1}(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta}\n\\\\\n& =\ng_k(z_1,\\ldots,z_n) .\n\\end{split}$$ Hence $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} = g_k$.\n\nWhen $k=1$, change coordinates to see that $$\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n g_1(\\zeta,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta - z_1}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta}\n=\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\n\\int_{\\mathbb C}\n\\frac{\n g_1(\\zeta+z_1,z_2,\\ldots,z_n)\n}{\\zeta}\nd\\zeta \\wedge d\\bar{\\zeta} .$$ Next differentiate in $\\bar{z}_k$ and\nchange coordinates back and apply the generalized Cauchy formula as\nbefore to get that $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_1} = g_1 .$\n\nLet $U \\subset {\\mathbb C}^n$, $K$ a compact subset of $U$ and $f$ be a\nholomorphic function defined on $U \\setminus K$ and $U \\setminus K$ to\nbe connected. By the smooth version of Urysohn\u2019s lemma we can find a\nsmooth function $\\varphi$ which is 1 in a neighbourhood of $K$ and is\ncompactly supported in $U.$ Let $f_0 := (1-\\varphi)f,$ which is\nidentically zero on $K$ and holomorphic near the boundary of $U$ (since\nthere $\\varphi$ is 0). We let $g = \\bar{\\partial} f_0$, that is\n$g_k = \\frac{\\partial\nf_0}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}$. Let us see why $g_k$ is compactly supported.\nThe only place to check is on $U \\setminus K$ as elsewhere we have 0\nautomatically, $$\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}\n=\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}\n((1-\\varphi)f)\n=\n- f \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k} .$$ By Lemma \\[lemma1\\]\nwe find a compactly supported solution $\\psi$ to\n$\\bar{\\partial}\\psi = g$.\n\nSet $\\tilde{f} := f_0 - \\psi$. Let us check that this is the desired\nextention. Firstly let us check it is holomorphic,\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{f}}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}\n=\n\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}\n-\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\bar{z}_k}\n=\ng_k\n-\ng_k\n= 0 .$$\n\nIt is not hard to see that $\\psi$ is compactly supported in $U.$ This\nfollows by the fact that $U \\setminus K$ is connected and the fact that\n$\\psi$ is holomorphic on the set where $g$ is identically zero. By\nunique continuation of holomorphic functions, support of $\\psi$ is no\nlarger than that of $g.$",
