  "definition": "In projective geometry, a set of points is said to be in *general\nposition* iff any $d+2$ of them do not lie on a $d$-dimensional plane,\ni.e., 4 points are in general position iff no three of them are on the\nsame line.\n\nDually a set of $d$-dimensional planes is said to be in general position\niff no $d+2$ of them meet in the same point, i.e., 4 lines are in\ngeneral position iff no three of them meet in the same point.",
