Then $M$ is a\nreal analytic submanifold.\n\nThe condition that $M$ is smooth cannot be relaxed to $C^k$ for\n$k < \\infty$. For example, note that in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$, the subvariety\n$y^3 - x^8 = 0$, which is the graph of the $C^1$ function\n$y = \\lvert x \\rvert^{\\frac{8}{3}}$, is not a real analytic submanifold.\n\n[9]{} Bernard Malgrange.
