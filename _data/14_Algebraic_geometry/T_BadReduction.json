  "definition": "Singular Cubic Curves\n=====================\n\nLet $E$ be a cubic curve over a field $K$ with Weierstrass equation\n$f(x,y)=0$, where: $$f(x,y)=y^2+a_1xy+a_3y-x^3-a_2x^2-a_4x-a_6$$ which\nhas a singular point $P=(x_0,y_0)$. This is equivalent to:\n$$\\partial f/ \\partial x(P)=\\partial f/ \\partial y(P)=0$$ and so we can\nwrite the Taylor expansion of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ as follows:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber f(x,y)-f(x_0,y_0)&=&\\lambda_1(x-x_0)^2+\\lambda_2(x-x_0)(y-y_0)+\\lambda_3(y-y_0)^2-(x-x_0)^3\\\\\n\\nonumber\n&=&[(y-y_0)-\\alpha(x-x_0)][(y-y_0)-\\beta(x-x_0)]-(x-x_0)^3\\end{aligned}$$\nfor some $\\lambda_i \\in K$ and $\\alpha,\\beta \\in \\bar{K}$ (an algebraic\nclosure of $K$).\\\n\nThe singular point $P$ is a *node* if $\\alpha\\neq\\beta$. In this case\nthere are two different tangent lines to $E$ at $P$, namely:\n$$y-y_0=\\alpha(x-x_0),\\quad y-y_0=\\beta(x-x_0)$$ If $\\alpha=\\beta$ then\nwe say that $P$ is a *cusp*, and there is a unique tangent line at $P$.\n\nNote: See the entry for elliptic curve for examples of cusps and nodes.\n\nThere is a very simple criterion to know whether a cubic curve in\nWeierstrass form is singular and to differentiate nodes from cusps:\n\nLet $E/K$ be given by a Weierstrass equation, and let $\\Delta$ be the\ndiscriminant and $c_4$ as in the definition of $\\Delta$. Then:\n\n1.  $E$ is singular if and only if $\\Delta=0$,\\\n\n2.  $E$ has a node if and only if $\\Delta=0$ and $c_4\\neq 0$,\\\n\n3.  $E$ has a cusp if and only if $\\Delta=0=c_4$.\n\nSee $\\cite{silverman}$, chapter III, Proposition 1.4, page 50.\n\nReduction of Elliptic Curves\n============================\n\nLet $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve (we could work over any number\nfield $K$, but we choose $\\mathbb{Q}$ for simplicity in the exposition).\nAssume that $E$ has a minimal model with Weierstrass equation:\n$$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ with coefficients in\n$\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $p$ be a prime in $\\mathbb{Z}$. By reducing each of\nthe coefficients $a_i$ modulo $p$ we obtain the equation of a cubic\ncurve $\\widetilde{E}$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (the field\nwith $p$ elements).\n\n1.  If $\\widetilde{E}$ is a non-singular curve then $\\widetilde{E}$ is\n    an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and we say that $E$ has *good\n    reduction* at $p$. Otherwise, we say that $E$ has *bad reduction* at\n    $p$.\n\n2.  If $\\widetilde{E}$ has a cusp then we say that $E$ has *additive\n    reduction* at $p$.\n\n3.  If $\\widetilde{E}$ has a node then we say that $E$ has\n    *multiplicative reduction* at $p$. If the slopes of the tangent\n    lines ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as above) are in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ then the\n    reduction is said to be *split* multiplicative (and *non-split*\n    otherwise).\n\nFrom *Proposition 1* we deduce the following:\n\nLet $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with coefficients in\n$\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $p\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ be a prime. If $E$ has bad reduction\nat $p$ then $p\\mid \\Delta$.\n\n[**Examples**]{}:\n\n1.  $E_1\\colon y^2=x^3+35x+5$ has good reduction at $p=7$.\n\n2.  However $E_1$ has bad reduction at $p=5$, and the reduction is\n    additive (since modulo $5$ we can write the equation as\n    $[(y-0)-0(x-0)]^2-x^3$ and the slope is $0$).\n\n3.  The elliptic curve $E_2\\colon y^2=x^3-x^2+35$ has bad multiplicative\n    reduction at $5$ and $7$. The reduction at $5$ is split, while the\n    reduction at $7$ is non-split. Indeed, modulo $5$ we could write the\n    equation as $[(y-0)-2(x-0)][(y-0)+2(x-0)]-x^3$, being the slopes $2$\n    and $-2$. However, for $p=7$ the slopes are not in $\\mathbb{F}_7$\n    ($\\sqrt{-1}$ is not in $\\mathbb{F}_7$).\n\n[9]{} James Milne, [*Elliptic Curves*]{}, . Joseph H.
