  "statement": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and let $L(E,s)$ be the\nL-series attached to $E$.\n\n1.  $L(E,s)$ has a zero at $s=1$ of order equal to the rank of\n    $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n2.  Let $R=\\operatorname{rank} (E(\\mathbb{Q}))$. Then the residue of\n    $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$, i.e. $\\lim_{s\\to 1}(s-1)^{-R} L(E,s)$ has a\n    concrete expression involving the following invariants of $E$: the\n    real period, the Tate-Shafarevich group, the elliptic regulator and\n    the Neron model of $E$.\n\nJ. Tate said about this conjecture: \u201c*This remarkable conjecture relates\nthe behavior of a function $L$ at a point where it is not at present\nknown to be defined to the order of a group (Sha) which is not known to\nbe finite!*\u201d The precise statement of the conjecture asserts that:\n\n$$\\lim_{s\\to 1} \\frac{L(E,s)}{(s-1)^R}=\\frac{|\\operatorname{Sha}|\\cdot \\Omega \\cdot \\operatorname{Reg}(E/{\\mathbb{Q}}) \\cdot \\prod_p c_p}{| E_{\\operatorname{tors}}({\\mathbb{Q}})|^2}$$\nwhere\n\n-   $R$ is the rank of $E/{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\n-   $\\Omega$ is either the real period or twice the real period of a\n    minimal model for $E$, depending on whether $E(\\mathbb{R})$ is\n    connected or not.\n\n-   $|\\operatorname{Sha}|$ is the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group of\n    $E/{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\n-   $\\operatorname{Reg}(E/{\\mathbb{Q}})$ is the of $E({\\mathbb{Q}})$.\n\n-   $|E_{\\operatorname{tors}}({\\mathbb{Q}})|$ is the number of torsion\n    points on $E/{\\mathbb{Q}}$ (including the point at infinity $O$).\n\n-   $c_p$ is an elementary local factor, equal to the cardinality of\n    $E({\\mathbb{Q}}_p)/E_0({\\mathbb{Q}}_p)$, where $E_0({\\mathbb{Q}}_p)$\n    is the set of points in $E({\\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ whose reduction modulo\n    $p$ is non-singular in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. Notice that if $p$ is a\n    prime of good reduction for $E/{\\mathbb{Q}}$ then $c_p=1$, so only\n    $c_p\\neq 1$ only for finitely many primes $p$. The number $c_p$ is\n    usually called the Tamagawa number of $E$ at $p$.\n\nThe following is an easy consequence of the B-SD conjecture:\n\nThe root number of $E$, denoted by $w$, indicates the parity of the rank\nof the elliptic curve, this is, $w=1$ if and only if the rank is even.\n\nThere has been a great amount of research towards the B-SD conjecture.\nFor example, there are some particular cases which are already known:\n\nSuppose $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over an imaginary quadratic\nfield $K$, with complex multiplication by $K$, and $L(E,s)$ is the\nL-series of $E$. If $L(E,1)\\neq 0$ then $E(K)$ is finite.\n\n[9]{} Claymath Institute, [*Description*]{}, . J. Coates, A. Wiles, [*On\nthe Conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer*]{}, Inv. Math. 39, 223-251\n(1977).
