  "definition": "Let $X$ be a noetherian integral separated scheme such that every local\nring $\\mathcal{O}_x$ of $X$ of dimension one is regular (such a scheme\n$X$ is said to be regular in codimension one, or non-singular in\ncodimension one).\n\nA prime divisor on $X$ is a closed integral subscheme $Y$ of codimension\none. We define an abelian group $\\operatorname{Div}(X)$ generated by the\nprime divisors on $X$. A Weil divisor is an element of\n$\\operatorname{Div}(X)$. Thus, a Weil divisor $\\mathcal{W}$ can be\nwritten as: $$\\mathcal{W}=\\sum n_Y Y$$ where the sum is over all the\nprime divisors $Y$ of $X$, the $n_Y$ are integers and only finitely many\nof them are non-zero. A degree of a divisor is defined to be\n$\\deg(\\mathcal{W})=\\sum n_Y$. Finally, a divisor is said to be effective\nif $n_Y\\geq 0$ for all the prime divisors $Y$.\n\nFor more information, see Hartshorne\u2019s book listed in the bibliography\nfor algebraic geometry.",
