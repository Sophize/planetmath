  "definition": "An [*affine algebraic group*]{} over a field $k$ is quasi-affine variety\n$G$ (a locally closed subset of affine space) over $k$, which is a\nequipped with a group such that the multiplication map\n$m:G\\times G\\to G$ and inverse map $i:G\\to G$ are algebraic.\n\nFor example, $k$ is an affine algebraic group over itself with the group\nlaw being addition, and as is $k^*=k-\\{0\\}$ with the group law\nmultiplication. Other common examples of affine algebraic groups are\n${\\mathrm{GL}_{n} k}$, the general linear group over $k$ (identifying\nmatrices with affine space) and any algebraic torus over $k$.",
