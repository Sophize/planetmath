  "definition": "The subset $\\{0\\}$ of a ring $R$ is the least two-sided ideal of $R$. As\na principal ideal, it is often denoted by $$(0)$$ and called the [*zero\nideal*]{}.\\\nThe zero ideal is the identity element in the addition of ideals and the\nabsorbing element in the . The quotient ring $R/(0)$ is trivially\nisomorphic to $R$.\n\nBy the entry quotient ring modulo prime ideal, (0) is a prime ideal if\nand only if $R$ in an integral domain.",
