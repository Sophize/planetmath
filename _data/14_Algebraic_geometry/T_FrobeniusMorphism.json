  "definition": "Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$ and let $q=p^r$. Let $C$ be a\ncurve defined over $K$ contained in $\\mathbb{P}^N$, the projective space\nof dimension $N$. Define the homogeneous ideal of $C$ to be (the ideal\ngenerated by):\n$$I(C)=\\{f\\in K[X_0,...,X_N] \\mid \\forall P \\in C,\\quad f(P)=0,\\quad f\\text{ is homogeneous}\\}$$\nFor $f\\in K[X_0,...,X_N]$, of the form $f=\\sum_i\na_iX_0^{i_0}...X_N^{i_N}$ we define $f^{(q)}=\\sum_i\na_i^qX_0^{i_0}...X_N^{i_N}$. We define a new curve $C^{(q)}$ as the zero\nset of the ideal (generated by):\n$$I(C^{(q)})=\\{f^{(q)}\\mid f\\in I(C)\\}$$\n\nThe $q^{th}$-power Frobenius morphism is defined to be:\n$$\\phi\\colon C\\to C^{(q)}$$ $$\\phi([x_0,...,x_N])=[x_0^q,...x_N^q]$$\n\nIn order to check that the Frobenius morphism is well defined we need to\nprove that $$P=[x_0,...,x_N]\\in C \\Rightarrow\n\\phi(P)=[x_0^q,...x_N^q]\\in C^{(q)}$$ This is equivalent to proving that\nfor any $g \\in I(C^{(q)})$ we have $g(\\phi(P))=0$. Without loss of\ngenerality we can assume that $g$ is a generator of $I(C^{(q)})$, i.e.\n$g$ is of the form $g=f^{(q)}$ for some $f\\in I(C)$. Then:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ng(\\phi(P))=f^{(q)}(\\phi(P)) &=& f^{(q)}([x_0^q,...,x_N^q])\\\\\n&=& (f([x_0,...,x_N]))^q,\\quad [a^q+b^q=(a+b)^q \\text{in characteristic $p$}] \\\\\n&=& (f(P))^q\\\\\n&=& 0,\\quad [P\\in C, f\\in I(C)]\\end{aligned}$$ as desired.\n\n[**Example**]{}: Suppose $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over\n$K=\\mathbb{F}_q$, the field of $p^r$ elements. In this case the\nFrobenius map is an automorphism of $K$, therefore $$E=E^{(q)}$$ Hence\nthe Frobenius morphism is an endomorphism (or isogeny) of the elliptic\ncurve.\n\n[9]{} Joseph H.
