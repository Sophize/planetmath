  "definition": "Spec as a set\n=============\n\nLet $R$ be any commutative ring with identity. The [*prime spectrum*]{}\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ of $R$ is defined to be the set\n$$\\{ P \\subsetneq R {\\mid}P \\text{ is a prime ideal of } R\\}.$$ For any\nsubset $A$ of $R$, we define the [*variety*]{} of $A$ to be the set\n$$V(A) := \\{ P \\in {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R) {\\mid}A \\subset P \\} \\subset {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$$\nIt is enough to restrict attention to subsets of $R$ which are ideals,\nsince, for any subset $A$ of $R$, we have $V(A) = V(I)$ where $I$ is the\nideal generated by $A$. In fact, even more is true: $V(I) =\nV(\\sqrt{I})$ where $\\sqrt{I}$ denotes the radical of the ideal $I$.\n\nSpec as a topological space\n===========================\n\nWe impose a topology on ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ by defining the sets\n$V(A)$ to be the collection of closed subsets of\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ (that is, a subset of\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is open if and only if it equals the\ncomplement of $V(A)$ for some subset $A$). The equations\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bigcap_{\\alpha} V(I_\\alpha) & = & V\\left(\\bigcup_{\\alpha} I_\\alpha\n\\right) \\\\\n\\bigcup_{i=1}^n V(I_i) & = & V\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^n I_i\\right),\\end{aligned}$$\nfor any ideals $I_\\alpha$, $I_i$ of $R$, establish that this collection\ndoes constitute a topology on ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$. This topology\nis called the [*Zariski topology*]{} in light of its relationship to the\nZariski topology on an algebraic variety (see Section\u00a0\\[variety\\]\nbelow). Note that a point $P \\in\n{\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is closed if and only if $P \\subset R$ is a\nmaximal ideal.\n\nA [*distinguished open set*]{} of ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is defined\nto be an open set of the form\n$${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)_f := \\{ P \\in {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R) {\\mid}f \\notin P \\} = {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R) \\setminus\nV(\\{f\\}),$$ for any element $f \\in R$. The collection of distinguished\nopen sets forms a topological basis for the open sets of\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$. In fact, we have\n$${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R) \\setminus V(A) = \\bigcup_{f \\in A} {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)_f.$$\n\nThe topological space ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ has the following\nadditional properties:\n\n-   ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is compact (but almost never Hausdorff).\n\n-   A subset of ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is an irreducible closed set\n    if and only if it equals $V(P)$ for some prime ideal $P$ of $R$.\n\n-   For $f \\in R$, let $R_f$ denote the localization of $R$ at $f$. Then\n    the topological spaces ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)_f$ and\n    ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R_f)$ are naturally homeomorphic, via the\n    correspondence sending a prime ideal of $R$ not containing $f$ to\n    the induced prime ideal in $R_f$.\n\n-   For $P \\in {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$, let $R_P$ denote the\n    localization of $R$ at the prime ideal $P$. Then the topological\n    spaces $V(P) \\subset\n    {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ and ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R_P)$ are\n    naturally homeomorphic, via the correspondence sending a prime ideal\n    of $R$ contained in $P$ to the induced prime ideal in $R_P$.\n\nSpec as a sheaf\n===============\n\nFor convenience, we adopt the usual convention of writing $X$ for\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$. For any $f \\in R$ and $P \\in X_f$, let\n$\\iota_{f,P}: R_f\n{\\longrightarrow}R_P$ be the natural inclusion map. Define a presheaf of\nrings ${\\mathcal{O}}_X$ on $X$ by setting\n$${\\mathcal{O}}_X(U) := \\left\\{ \\left.(s_P) \\in \\prod_{P \\in U} R_P \\ \\right|\n\\mbox{\n\\begin{tabular}{l}\n$U$ has an open cover $\\{ X_{f_\\alpha} \\}$ with elements\n$s_\\alpha \\in R_{f_\\alpha}$ \\\\\nsuch that $s_P = \\iota_{f_\\alpha,P}(s_\\alpha)$\nwhenever $P \\in X_{f_\\alpha}$\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\right\\},$$ for each open set $U \\subset X$. The restriction map\n${\\operatorname{res}}_{U,V}:\n{\\mathcal{O}}_X(U) {\\longrightarrow}{\\mathcal{O}}_X(V)$ is the map\ninduced by the projection map\n$$\\prod_{P \\in U} R_P {\\longrightarrow}\\prod_{P \\in V} R_P,$$ for each\nopen subset $V \\subset U$. The presheaf ${\\mathcal{O}}_X$ satisfies the\nfollowing properties:\n\n1.  ${\\mathcal{O}}_X$ is a sheaf.\n\n2.  ${\\mathcal{O}}_X(X_f) = R_f$ for every $f \\in R$.\n\n3.  The stalk $({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_P$ is equal to $R_P$ for every\n    $P \\in X$. (In particular, $X$ is a locally ringed space.)\n\n4.  The restriction sheaf of ${\\mathcal{O}}_X$ to $X_f$ is isomorphic as\n    a sheaf to ${\\mathcal{O}}_{{\\operatorname{Spec}}(R_f)}$.\n\nRelationship to algebraic varieties {#variety}\n===================================\n\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ is sometimes called an [*affine scheme*]{}\nbecause of the close relationship between affine varieties in\n${\\mathbb{A}}_k^n$ and the ${\\operatorname{Spec}}$ of their\ncorresponding coordinate rings. In fact, the correspondence between the\ntwo is an equivalence of categories, although a complete statement of\nthis equivalence requires the notion of [*morphisms of schemes*]{} and\nwill not be given here. Nevertheless, we explain what we can of this\ncorrespondence below.\n\nLet $k$ be a field and write as usual ${\\mathbb{A}}_k^n$ for the vector\nspace $k^n$. Recall that an affine variety $V$ in ${\\mathbb{A}}_k^n$ is\nthe set of common zeros of some prime ideal $I \\subset k[X_1,\n\\ldots, X_n]$. The coordinate ring of $V$ is defined to be the ring\n$R := k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]/I$, and there is an embedding\n$i: V \\hookrightarrow {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ given by\n$$i(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) := (X_1 - a_1, \\ldots, X_n - a_n) \\in {\\operatorname{Spec}}(R).$$\nThe function $i$ is not a homeomorphism, because it is not a bijection\n(its image is contained inside the set of maximal ideals of $R$).\nHowever, the map $i$ does define an order preserving bijection between\nthe open sets of $V$ and the open sets of ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ in\nthe Zariski topology. This isomorphism between these two lattices of\nopen sets can be used to equate the sheaf ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$\nwith the structure sheaf of the variety $V$, showing that the two\nobjects are identical in every respect except for the minor detail of\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ having more points than $V$.\n\nThe additional points of ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ are valuable in many\nsituations and a systematic study of them leads to the general notion of\nschemes. As just one example, the classical Bezout\u2019s theorem is only\nvalid for algebraically closed fields, but admits a scheme\u2013theoretic\ngeneralization which holds over non\u2013algebraically closed fields as well.\nWe will not attempt to explain the theory of schemes in detail, instead\nreferring the interested reader to the references below.\n\n**Remark**. The spectrum ${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$ of a ring $R$ may be\ngeneralized to the case when $R$ is not commutative, as long as $R$\ncontains the multiplicative identity. For a ring $R$ with $1$, the\n${\\operatorname{Spec}}(R)$, like above, is the set of all proper prime\nideals of $R$. This definition is used to develop the noncommutative\nversion of Hilbert\u2019s Nullstellensatz.\n\n[9]{} Robin Hartshorne, [*Algebraic Geometry*]{}, Springer\u2013Verlag New\nYork, Inc., 1977 (GTM [**52**]{}).
