  "definition": "Let $C$ be a non-singular curve in the plane, defined over an\nalgebraically closed field $K$, and given by a polynomial $f(x,y)=0$ of\ndegree $4$ (i.e. $C$ is a quartic). Let $L$ be a (rational) line in the\nplane $K^2$. The intersection divisor of $C$ and $L$ is of the form:\n\n$$(L\\cdot C)=P_1+P_2+P_3+P_4$$ where $P_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$, are points in\n$C(K)$. There are five possibilities:\n\n1.  The generic position: all the points $P_i$ are distinct.\n\n2.  $L$ is tangent to $C$: there exist indices $1\\leq i\\neq j\\leq 4$\n    such that $P_i=P_j$. Without loss of generality we may assume\n    $P_1=P_2$ and $(L\\cdot C)=2P_1 + P_3+P_4$, and $P_3\\neq P_4$.\n\n3.  $L$ is bitangent to $C$ when $P_1=P_2$ and $P_3=P_4$ but\n    $P_1\\neq P_3$. It may be shown that if\n    $\\operatorname{char}(K)\\neq 2$ then $C$ has exactly $28$ bitangent\n    lines.\n\n4.  $L$ intersects $C$ at exactly two points, thus\n    $P_1=P_2=P_3\\neq P_4$. The point $P_1$ is called a [*flex*]{}.\n\n5.  $L$ intersects $C$ at exactly one point and $P_1=P_2=P_3=P_4$. This\n    point is called a [*hyperflex*]{}. A quartic $C$ may not have any\n    hyperflex.\n\n[00]{} S. Flon, R. Oyono, C. Ritzenthaler, [*Fast addition on\nnon-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves*]{}, can be found .",
