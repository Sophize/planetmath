For any affine variety\n$V \\subset {\\mathbb{A}}_k^n$, the [*Zariski topology*]{} on $V$ is\ndefined to be the subspace topology induced on $V$ as a subset of\n${\\mathbb{A}}_k^n$.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb{P}}_k^n$ denote $n$\u2013dimensional projective space over $k$.\nThe [*Zariski topology*]{} on ${\\mathbb{P}}_k^n$ is defined to be the\ntopology whose closed sets are the sets\n$$V(I) := \\{ x \\in {\\mathbb{P}}_k^n \\mid f(x) = 0 \\text{ for all } f \\in I\\} \\subset {\\mathbb{P}}_k^n,$$\nwhere $I \\subset k[X_0, \\ldots, X_n]$ is any homogeneous ideal in the\ngraded $k$\u2013algebra $k[X_0, \\ldots, X_n]$.

Every regular morphism of varieties is continuous in\nthe Zariski topology (but not every continuous map in the Zariski\ntopology is a regular morphism). In fact, the Zariski topology is the\nweakest topology on varieties making points in ${\\mathbb{A}}_k^1$ closed\nand regular morphisms continuous.",
