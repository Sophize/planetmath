  "statement": "Let $Q$ be a disconnected quiver, i.e. $Q$ can be written as a disjoint\nunion of two quivers $Q'$ and $Q''$ (which means that there is no path\nstarting in $Q'$ and ending in $Q''$ and vice versa) and let $k$ be an\narbitrary field.\n\n**Proposition.** The path algebra $kQ$ is isomorphic to the product of\npath algebras $kQ'\\times kQ''$.\n\n*Proof.* If $w$ is a path in $Q$, then $w$ belongs either to $Q'$ or\n$Q''$. Define linear map $$T:kQ\\to kQ'\\times kQ''$$ by $T(w)=(w,0)$ if\n$w\\in Q'$ or $T(w)=(0,w)$ if $w\\in Q''$ and extend it linearly to entire\n$kQ$. We will show that $T$ is an isomorphism of algebras.\n\nIf $w,w'$ are paths in $Q$, then since $Q'$ and $Q''$ are disjoint, then\neach of them entirely lies in $Q'$ or $Q''$. Now since $Q'$ and $Q''$\ndon\u2019t have common vertices it follows that $w\\cdot w'=w'\\cdot w=0$.\nWithout loss of generality we may assume, that $w$ is in $Q'$ and $w'$\nis in $Q''$. Then we have\n$$T(w\\cdot w')=T(0)=(0,0)=(w,0)\\cdot(0,w')=T(w)\\cdot T(w').$$ If both\nlie in the same component, for example in $Q'$, then\n$$T(w\\cdot w')=(w\\cdot w',0)=(w,0)\\cdot(w',0)=T(w)\\cdot T(w').$$ Since\n$T$ preservers multiplication on paths, then $T$ preserves\nmultiplication and thus $T$ is an algebra homomorphism.\n\nObviously by definition $T$ is 1-1.\n\nIt remains to show, that $T$ is onto. Assume that\n$(a,b)\\in kQ'\\oplus kQ''$. Then we can write\n$$(a,b)=\\sum_{i,j}\\lambda_{i,j}(v_i,w_j)=\\sum_{i,j}\\lambda_{i,j}(v_i,0) + \\sum_{i,j}\\lambda_{i,j}(0,w_j),$$\nwhere $v_i$ are paths in $Q'$ and $w_j$ are paths in $Q''$. It can be\neasily checked, that\n$$T\\left(\\sum_{i,j}\\lambda_{i,j}(v_i + w_j)\\right)=(a,b).$$ Here we\nconsider all $v_i$ and $w_j$ as paths in $Q$.\n\nThus $T$ is an isomorphism, which completes the proof. $\\square$",
