  "definition": "Let $E$ and $E'$ be elliptic curves over a field $k$. An [*isogeny*]{}\nbetween $E$ and $E'$ is a finite morphism $f : E\\to E'$ of varieties\nthat preserves basepoints.\n\nThe two curves are called [*isogenous*]{} if there is an isogeny between\nthem. This is an equivalence relation, symmetry being due to the\nexistence of the dual isogeny. Every isogeny is an algebraic\nhomomorphism and thus induces homomorphisms of the groups of the\nelliptic curves for $k$-valued points.",
