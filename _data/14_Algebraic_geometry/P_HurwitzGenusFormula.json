  "statement": "The following formula, due to Hurwitz, is extremely useful when trying\nto compute the genus of an algebraic curve. In this entry $K$ is a\nperfect field (i.e. every algebraic extension of $K$ is separable).\nRecall that a non-constant map of curves $\\psi: C_1 \\to C_2$ over $K$ is\nseparable if the extension of function fields $K(C_1)/\\psi^\\ast K(C_2)$\nis a separable extension of fields.\n\nLet $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two smooth curves defined over $K$ of genus $g_1$\nand $g_2$, respectively. Let $\\psi : C_1 \\to C_2$ be a non-constant and\nseparable map. Then\n$$2g_1-2 \\geq (\\deg \\psi)(2g_2-2) + \\sum_{P\\in C_1} (e_{\\psi}(P)-1)$$\nwhere $e_{\\psi}(P)$ is the ramification index of $\\psi$ at $P$.\nMoreover, there is equality if and only if either\n$\\operatorname{char}(K)=0$ or $\\operatorname{char}(K)=p>0$ and $p$ does\nnot divide $e_{\\psi}(P)$ for all $P\\in C_1$.\n\nAs an application of the Hurwitz genus formula, we show that an elliptic\ncurve $E : y^2=x(x-\\alpha)(x-\\beta)$ defined over a field $K$ of\ncharacteristic $0$ has genus $1$. Notice that the fact that $E$ is an\nelliptic curve over $K$ implies that $0,\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are distinct\nelements of $K$, otherwise $E$ would be a singular curve. We define a\nmap: $$\\psi : E \\to \\mathbb{P}^1, \\quad [x,y,z] \\mapsto [x,z]$$ and\nnotice that $[0,1,0]$, the \u201cpoint at infinity\u201d of $E$, maps to $[1,0]$,\nthe point at infinity of $\\mathbb{P}^1$. The degree of this map is $2$:\ngenerically every point in $\\mathbb{P}^1$ has two preimages, namely\n$[x,y,z]$ and $[x,-y,z]$. Moreover, the genus of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is $0$\nand the map $\\psi$ is ramified exactly at $4$ points, namely\n$P_1=[0,0,1], P_2=[\\alpha,0,1], P_3=[\\beta,0,1]$ and the point at\ninfinity. It is easily checked that the ramification index at each point\nis $e_\\psi(P_i)=2$. Hence, the Hurwitz formula reads:\n$$2g_1-2=2(2\\cdot 0 -2)+\\sum_{i=1}^4(e_\\psi(P_i)-1)=-4+4=0.$$ We\nconclude that $g_1=1$, as claimed.",
