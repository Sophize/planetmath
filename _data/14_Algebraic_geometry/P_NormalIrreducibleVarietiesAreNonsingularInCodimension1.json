  "statement": "Let $X$ be a normal irreducible variety. The singular set $S\\subset X$\nhas codimension 2 or more.\n\nAssume not. We may assume $X$ is affine, since codimension is local. Now\nlet ${\\mathfrak{u}}$ be the ideal of functions vanishing on $S$. This is\nan ideal of height 1, so the local ring of $Y$,\n${\\mathcal{O}}_S=A(X)_{{\\mathfrak{u}}}$, where $A(X)$ is the affine ring\nof $X$, is a 1-dimensional local ring, and integrally closed, since $X$\nis normal. Any integrally closed 1-dimensional local domain is a DVR,\nand thus regular. But $S$ is the singular set, so its local ring is not\nregular, a contradiction.",
