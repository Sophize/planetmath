  "statement": "Let $\\mathcal{Q}$ denote the category of all quivers and quiver\nmorphisms with standard composition. If $Q=(Q_0,Q_1,s,t)$ is a quiver,\nthen we can associate with $Q$ the set $$S(Q)=Q_0\\sqcup Q_1$$ where\n,,$\\sqcup$\u201d denotes the disjoint union of sets.\n\nFurthermore, if $F:Q\\to Q'$ is a morphism of quivers, then $F$ induces\nfunction $$S(F):S(Q)\\to S(Q')$$ by putting $S(F)(a)=F_0(a)$ if\n$a\\in Q_0$ and $S(F)(\\alpha)=F_1(\\alpha)$ if $\\alpha\\in Q_1$.\n\n**Proposition.** The category $\\mathcal{Q}$ together with\n$S:\\mathcal{Q}\\to\\mathcal{SET}$ is a concrete category over the category\nof all sets $\\mathcal{SET}$.\n\n*Proof.* The fact that $S$ is a functor we leave as a simple exercise.\nNow assume, that $F,G:Q\\to Q'$ are morphisms of quivers such that\n$S(F)=S(G)$. It follows, that for any vertex $a\\in Q_0$ and any arrow\n$\\alpha\\in Q_1$ we have $$F_0(a)=S(F)(a)=S(G)(a)=G_0(a);$$\n$$F_1(\\alpha)=S(F)(\\alpha)=S(G)(\\alpha)=G_1(\\alpha)$$ which clearly\nproves that $F=G$. This completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Remark.** Note, that if $F:Q\\to Q'$ is a morphism of quivers, then $F$\nis injective in $(\\mathcal{Q}, S)$ (see for details) if and only if both\n$F_0$, $F_1$ are injective. The same holds if we replace word\n,,injective\u201d with ,,surjective\u201d.",
