  "statement": "Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group, and $\\lambda$ be an integral weight\nfor that group. $\\lambda$ naturally defines a one-dimensional\nrepresentation $C_\\lambda$ of the Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$, by simply\npulling back the representation on the maximal torus $T=B/U$ where $U$\nis the unipotent radical of $G$. Since we can think of the projection\nmap $\\pi\\colon G\\to G/B$ as a , to each $C_\\lambda$, we get an\nassociated fiber bundle ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$ on $G/B$, which is\nobviously a line bundle. Identifying ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$ with its\nsheaf of holomorphic sections, we consider the sheaf cohomology groups\n$H^i({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)$. Realizing ${\\mathfrak{g}}$, the Lie\nalgebra of $G$, as vector fields on $G/B$, we see that ${\\mathfrak{g}}$\nacts on the sections of ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$ over any open set, and\nso we get an action on cohomology groups. This integrates to an action\nof $G$, which on $H^0({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)$ is simply the obvious\naction of the group.\n\nThe Borel-Bott-Weil theorem states the following: if\n$(\\lambda+\\rho,\\alpha)=0$ for any simple root $\\alpha$ of\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$, then $$H^i({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)=0$$ for all $i$,\nwhere $\\rho$ is half the sum of all the positive roots. Otherwise, let\n$w\\in W$, the Weyl group of $G$, be the unique element such that\n$w(\\lambda+\\rho)$ is dominant (i.e. $(w(\\lambda+\\rho),\\alpha)>0$ for all\nsimple roots $\\alpha$). Then\n$$H^{\\ell(w)}({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)\\cong V_\\lambda$$ where $V_\\lambda$\nis the unique irreducible representation of highest weight $\\lambda$,\nand $H^i({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)=0$ for all other $i$. In particular, if\n$\\lambda$ is already dominant, then\n$\\Gamma({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)\\cong V_\\lambda$, and the higher\ncohomology of ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$ vanishes.\n\nIf $\\lambda$ is dominant, than ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$ is generated by\nglobal sections, and thus determines a map\n$$m_\\lambda\\colon G/B\\to\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\Gamma({\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda)\\right).$$\nThis map is an obvious one, which takes the coset of $B$ to the highest\nweight vector $v_0$ of $V_\\lambda$. This can be extended by equivariance\nsince $B$ fixes $v_0$. This provides an alternate description of\n${\\mathcal{L}}_\\lambda$.\n\nFor example, consider $G=\\mathrm{SL}_2{\\mathbb{C}}$. $G/B$ is\n${\\mathbb{C}}P^1$, the Riemann sphere, and an integral weight is\nspecified simply by an integer $n$, and $\\rho=1$. The line bundle\n${\\mathcal{L}}_n$ is simply ${\\mathcal{O}}(n)$, whose sections are the\nhomogeneous polynomials of degree $n$. This gives us in one stroke the\nrepresentation theory of $\\mathrm{SL}_2{\\mathbb{C}}$:\n$\\Gamma({\\mathcal{O}}(1))$ is the standard representation, and\n$\\Gamma({\\mathcal{O}}(n))$ is its $n$th symmetric power. We even have a\nunified decription of the action of the Lie algebra, derived from its\nrealization as vector fields on ${\\mathbb{C}}P^1$: if $H,X,Y$ are the\nstandard generators of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2{\\mathbb{C}}$, then\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nH&=x\\frac{d}{dx}-y\\frac{d}{dy}\\\\\nX&=x\\frac{d}{dy}\\\\\nY&=y\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\\\end{aligned}$$",
