  "definition": "Let $k$ be a field and let $C/k$ be a smooth projective curve defined\nover the field $k$ and has genus $g$. The function field of $C/k$ will\nbe denoted by $K=k(C)$. An elliptic surface ${\\mathcal{E}}$ over the\ncurve $C$ is, by definition, a two-dimensional projective variety\ntogether with:\n\n1.  A morphism $\\pi: {\\mathcal{E}}\\to C$ such that for all but finitely\n    many points $t\\in C(\\overline{k})$, the fiber\n    ${\\mathcal{E}}_t=\\pi^{-1}(t)$ is a non-singular curve of genus $1$,\n\n2.  A section to $\\pi$ (the [*zero section*]{}) $\\sigma_0: C \\to\n    {\\mathcal{E}}$.\n\nWith this definition, ${\\mathcal{E}}/K$ may be regarded as an elliptic\ncurve over the field $K$.\n\nThe surface $y^2=x^3+t$ is an elliptic surface over the curve\n$\\mathbb{P}^1({\\mathbb{Q}})$. It may be regarded as an elliptic curve\nover the function field ${\\mathbb{Q}}(t)$.\n\n[00]{}\n\nR.
