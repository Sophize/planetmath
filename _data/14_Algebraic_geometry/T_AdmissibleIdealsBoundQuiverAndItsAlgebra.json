  "definition": "Assume, that $Q$ is a quiver and $k$ is a field. Let $kQ$ be the\nassociated path algebra. Denote by $R_Q$ the two-sided ideal in $kQ$\ngenerated by all paths of length $1$, i.e. all arrows. This ideal is\nknown as the **arrow ideal**.\n\nIt is easy to see, that for any $m\\geqslant 1$ we have that $R_Q^m$ is a\ntwo-sided ideal generated by all paths of length $m$. Note, that we have\nthe following chain of ideals:\n$$R_Q^2\\supseteq R_Q^3\\supseteq R_Q^4\\supseteq\\cdots$$\n\n**Definition.** A two-sided ideal $I$ in $kQ$ is said to be\n**admissible** if there exists $m\\geqslant 2$ such that\n$$R_Q^m\\subseteq I\\subseteq R_Q^2.$$ If $I$ is an admissible ideal in\n$kQ$, then the pair $(Q,I)$ is said to be a **bound quiver** and the\nquotient algebra $kQ/I$ is called **bound quiver algebra**.\n\nThe idea behind this is to treat some paths in a quiver as equivalent.\nFor example consider the following quiver $$\\xymatrix{\n& 2\\ar[dr]^{b} & \\\\\n1\\ar[rr]^{c}\\ar[dr]_{e}\\ar[ur]^{a} & & 3\\\\\n& 4\\ar[ur]_{f}\n}$$ Then the ideal generated by $ab-c$ is not admissible\n($ab-c\\not\\in R^2_Q$) but an ideal generated by $ab-ef$ is. We can see\nthat this means that ,,walking\u201d from $1$ to $3$ directly and through $2$\nis not the same, but walking in the same number of steps is.\n\nNote, that in our case there is no path of length greater then $2$. In\nparticular, for any $m> 2$ we have $R_Q^m=0$.\n\nMore generally, it can be easily checked, that if $Q$ is a finite quiver\nwithout oriented cycles, then there exists $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that\n$R_Q^m=0$",
