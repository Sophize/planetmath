  "definition": "The [*Picard group*]{} of a variety, scheme, or more generally locally\nringed space $(X,O_X)$ is the group of locally free $O_X$ modules of\nrank $1$ with tensor product over $O_X$ as the operation, usually\ndenoted by $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$. Alternatively, the Picard group is\nthe group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves on $X$, under\ntensor products.\n\nIt is not difficult to see that $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ is isomorphic to\n${\\rm H}^1(X, O_X^*)$, the first sheaf cohomology group of the\nmultiplicative sheaf $O_X^*$ which consists of the units of $O_X$.\n\nFinally, let $\\operatorname{CaCl}(X)$ be the group of Cartier divisors\non $X$ modulo linear equivalence. If $X$ is an integral scheme then the\ngroups $\\operatorname{CaCl}(X)$ and $\\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ are\nisomorphic. Furthermote, if we let $\\operatorname{Cl}(X)$ be the class\ngroup of Weil divisors (divisors modulo principal divisors) and $X$ is a\nnoetherian, integral and separated locally factorial scheme, then there\nis a natural isomorphism\n$\\operatorname{Cl}(X)\\cong \\operatorname{Pic}(X)$. Thus, the Picard\ngroup is sometimes called the [*divisor class group*]{} of $X$.",
