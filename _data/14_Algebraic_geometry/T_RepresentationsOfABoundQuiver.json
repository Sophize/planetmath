  "definition": "Let $(Q,I)$ be a over a field $k$.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{V}$ be a representation of $Q$ over $k$ composed by\n$\\{f(q)\\}_{q\\in Q_1}$ a family of linear maps. If\n$$w=(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n)$$ is a path in $Q$, then we have the\nevaluation map\n$$f_{w}=f(\\alpha_n)\\circ f(\\alpha_{n-1})\\circ\\cdots\\circ f(\\alpha_2)\\circ f(\\alpha_1).$$\nFor stationary paths we define $f_{e_x}:V_x\\to V_x$ by $f_{e_x}=0$.\nAlso, note that if $\\rho$ is a in $Q$, then\n$$\\rho=\\sum_{i=1}^m\\lambda_i\\cdot w_i$$ where all $w_i$\u2019s have the same\nsource and target. Thus it makes sense to talk about evaluation in\n$\\rho$, i.e. $$f_{\\rho}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\lambda_i\\cdot f_{w_i}.$$ In\nparticular $$f_{\\rho}:V_{s(w_i)}\\to V_{t(w_i})$$ is a linear map.\n\nRecall that the ideal $I$ is generated by relations (see )\n$\\{\\rho_1,\\ldots,\\rho_n\\}$.\n\n**Definition.** A representation $\\mathbb{V}$ of $Q$ over $k$ with\nlinear mappings $\\{f(q)\\}_{q\\in Q_1}$ is said to be **bound by $I$** if\n$$f_{\\rho_i}=0$$ for every $i=1,\\ldots,n$.\n\nIt can be easily checked, that this definition does not depend on the\nchoice of (relation) generators of $I$.\n\nThe full subcategory of the category of all representations which is\ncomposed of all representations bound by $I$ is denoted by\n$\\mathrm{REP}(Q,I)$. It can be easily seen, that it is abelian.",
