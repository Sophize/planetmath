  "definition": "An elliptic curve $E$ over a field of characteristic $p$ defined by the\ncubic equation $f(w,x,y) = 0$ is called [*supersingular*]{} if the\ncoefficient of $(wxy)^{p-1}$ in $f(w,x,y)^{p-1}$ is zero.\n\nA supersingular elliptic curve is said to have Hasse invariant $0$; an\nordinary (i.e. non-supersingular) elliptic curve is said to have Hasse\ninvariant $1$.\n\nThis is equivalent to many other conditions. $E$ is supersingular iff\nthe invariant differential is exact. Also, $E$ is supersingular iff\n$F^* : H^1(E,\\mathcal{O}_E)\\to H^1(E,\\mathcal{O}_E)$ is nonzero where\n$F^*$ is induced from the Frobenius morphism $F : E\\to E$.",
