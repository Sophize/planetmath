  "definition": "Let $k$ be a field and let $M \\subset k^n$ be a submanifold. $M$ is said\nto be an *algebraic manifold* (or $k$-algebraic) if there exists an\nirreducible algebraic variety $V \\subset k^n$ such that\n$\\dim V = \\dim M$ and $M \\subset V$. If $k = \\mathbb{R}$, then $M$ is\ncalled a *Nash manifold*.\n\nIt can be proved that such a manifold is defined as the zero set of a\nfinite collection of analytic algebraic functions.\n\n[9]{} M.
