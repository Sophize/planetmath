  "definition": "Let $f:{\\mathbb R}^n {\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb R}$ be a $C^1$ function\nand consider the transformation\n$x=\\left(x_1,\\cdots, x_n \\right) {\\longrightarrow}y=\\left(y_1,\\cdots, y_n \\right)=\\left(\n\\partial_1 f(x), x_2, \\cdots, x_n \\right)$. Provided it is possible to\ninvert [^1] for $x$, $x=\\varphi(y)$, we define the *Legendre Transform*\nof $f$, $\\mathcal L f$, as the function $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nonumber \\mathcal L f=g: & {\\mathbb R}^n & {\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb R}\\\\ \\nonumber &y& {\\longrightarrow}g(y)=\\varphi(y) \\cdot y - f(\\varphi(y))\\end{aligned}$$(here\n\u2019$\\cdot$\u2019 denotes the usual scalar product on ${\\mathbb R}^n$).\n$\\mathcal L$ is called the Legendre Transformation.\n\nAs $x=\\varphi(y)$, the defining relation is often written as\n$g(y)=x \\cdot y - f(x)$, without explicitly indicating that $x$ must be\na function of $y$\n\nNote that, in inverting for $x$, $x=\\varphi(y)$, we are making\n$y=(y_1, \\cdots, y_n)$ the **independent** variables. This is more an\nissue related to the Inverse Mapping Theorem, but it is well worth to\nstate it explicitly.\n\nFrom the definition we see that the Legendre Transformation allows us to\npass from a function $f$ of $(x_1,\n\\cdots x_n)$ to a function in which we have substituted the first\ncoordinate by the derivative of $\\partial_1 f$. We will deal here with\nthe case in which just one coordinate is changed but proceeding by\ninduction it is easy to prove the following facts for any number of\nvariables.\n\nThe rationale behind the Legendre transformation is the following. Let\u2019s\nbegin by considering the unidimensional case. Suppose we have the\nfunction $x \\to f(x)$. We could be interested in expressing the values\nof $f$ as function of the derivative $m=f_x(x)$ instead of as function\nof $x$ itself without losing any information about $f$ (some examples of\nthis situation will be given below). At first glance one could think of\njust inverting the relation $m=f_x(x)$ for $x$ to write\n$f(x)=f(f_x^{-1}(m))\\equiv\ng(m)$. However, this would result in a loss of information because there\nwould be infinite functions $f$ which will give rise to the same $g$;\nnamely the family of translated functions $f(x-a)$ for any\n$a \\in {\\mathbb R}$ will result in the same $g$. This can be easily\nvisualized in the figure.\n\nThis is because we can not entirely determine a curve by knowing its\nslope at every point. The key point is that we can, nevertheless,\ndetermine a curve by knowing its slope **and** its origin ordinate at\nevery point.\n\nTake a point P on the curve with abscise $x$ -see figure 2-.\n\nCall the origin ordinate of its tangent $\\psi$ and its slope $m$ which\nis given by $$m=\\frac{f(x)-\\psi}{x-0}$$ Then $\\psi=f-x\\cdot\nm$. So, intuitively we see that *the Legendre transform is nothing but\nthe origin ordinate of the slope of $f$ at x*. It is obvious -at least\ngraphically- that we can recover $f$ knowing $\\psi(m)$. We now prove it\nrigourously.\n\nThe Legendre Transformation is invertible and the Inverse Legendre\nTransformation is the Legendre Transformation itself, that is,\n$\\mathcal L \\mathcal L^{-1} f = f$ or $\\mathcal L=\\mathcal L^{-1}$.\n\nEvaluate the function $g$ at point $y=\\varphi^{-1}(x)$ to get\n$$g(\\varphi^{-1}(x))=x \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(x)-f(x)$$ this is\n$$f(x)=x \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(x) - g(\\varphi^{-1}(x))$$ Now, it is easy to\nshow that\n$x=\\left(x_1,\\cdots, x_n \\right)=\\left(\\partial_1 g(y), y_2, \\cdots,\ny_n \\right)$. So, according to the definition, this is the Legendre\ntransform of $g$ induced by the transformation $y {\\longrightarrow}x$,\n$y=\\varphi^{-1}(x)$.\n\nIn thermodynamics, a thermodynamic system is completely described by\nknowing its *fundamental equation in energetic form*: $\\mathcal\nU=U(S,V)$ where $\\mathcal U$ is the energy, $S$ is entropy and $V$ is\nvolume. This relation, although of great theoretical value, has a major\ndrawback, namely that entropy is not a measurable quantity. However, it\nhappens that $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}=T$, temperature. So, we\nwould like to being able to swap $S$ for $T$ which is an easily\nmeasurable quantity. We just take the Legendre transform $F$ of $U$\ninduced by the transformation\n$(S,V) {\\longrightarrow}(T,V)=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}, V \\right)$:\n$$F=U-TS$$ which is called the *Helmholtz Potential* and hence is a\nfunction of the independent variables $T,V$ Analogously, as it happens\nthat $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}=-P$, pressure, we can swap $V$ and\n$P$ and consider the Legendre Transformation $H$ of $U$ induced by the\ntransformation $(S,V) {\\longrightarrow}(S,P)$: $$H=U+PV$$ which is\ncalled *Enthaply* and hence is a function of the independent variables\n$S,P$.\n\nThe Lagrangian formalism in Mechanics allows to completely determine the\nevolution of a general mechanical system by knowledge of the so called\nLagrangian, $\\mathcal L$ which is a function of generalized coordinates\n$q$, generalized velocities [^2] $v$ and time $t$:\n$\\mathcal L=L(q,v,t$). The generalized moments are defined as\n$p=\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v}$ and they play the role of usual linear\nmomentum. Generalized moments are conserved in time under certain\ncircumstances, so we would like to swap the role of $v$ and $p$. Thus we\nconsider the Legendre transform $H$ of $L$ induced by the transformation\n$(q,v,t) {\\longrightarrow}(q,p,t)=\\left(q,\\frac{\\partial\nL}{\\partial v}, t \\right)$: $$H=L-p \\cdot v$$ which is called the\nHamiltonian. As pointed out in Remark 2, $q, p$ and $t$ are independent\nvariables, as we have inverted the mentioned transformation\n$(q,v,t) {\\longrightarrow}(q,p,t)$\n\n[^1]: The Inverse Mapping Theorem and its implications must be used\n    here; in order to be possible to invert for $x$, the Jacobian must\n    be different from zero. The Jacobian being\n    $\\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2}$ in this case indicates that\n    $\\frac{\\partial^2 f(x)}{\\partial x^2} \\neq 0$, which means that\n    $f(x)$ must be strictly concave or strictly convex; this seems clear\n    graphically\n\n[^2]: The customary notation for generalized velocities is $\\dot{q}$;\n    however this notation is somehow obscure because it is prone to\n    establish a functional relation between $q$ and $\\dot{q}$ as\n    variables of L. As variables of L they are just points in\n    ${\\mathbb R}^n$",
