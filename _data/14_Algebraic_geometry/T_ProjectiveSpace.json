  "definition": "#### Projective space and homogeneous coordinates.\n\nLet ${\\mathbb{K}}$ be a field. [*Projective space*]{} of dimension $n$\nover ${\\mathbb{K}}$, typically denoted by ${{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n$,\nis the set of lines passing through the origin in ${\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}$.\nMore formally, consider the equivalence relation $\\sim$ on the set of\nnon-zero points ${{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}\\backslash \\{0\\}}$ defined by\n$${\\mathbf{x}}\\sim \\lambda {\\mathbf{x}},\\quad {\\mathbf{x}}\\in {{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}\\backslash \\{0\\}},\\quad \\lambda \\in\n{\\mathbb{K}}\\backslash\\{0\\}.$$ Projective space is defined to be the set\nof the corresponding equivalence classes.\n\nEvery\n${\\mathbf{x}}=(x_0,\\ldots,x_n)\\in{{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}\\backslash \\{0\\}}$\ndetermines an element of projective space, namely the line passing\nthrough ${\\mathbf{x}}$. Formally, this line is the equivalence class\n$[{\\mathbf{x}}]$, or $[x_0:x_1:\\ldots:x_n]$, as it is commonly denoted.\nThe numbers $x_0,\\ldots,x_n$ are referred to as *homogeneous\ncoordinates* of the line. Homogeneous coordinates differ from ordinary\ncoordinate systems in that a given element of projective space is\nlabeled by multiple homogeneous \u201ccoordinates\u201d.\n\n#### Affine coordinates.\n\nProjective space also admits a more conventional type of coordinate\nsystem, called affine coordinates. Let\n$A_0\\subset{{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n$ be the subset of all elements\n$p=[x_0:x_1:\\ldots:x_n]\\in{{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n$ such that\n$x_0\\neq 0$. We then define the functions\n$$X_i:A_0\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}^n,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n,$$ according to\n$$X_i(p) = \\frac{x_i}{x_0},$$ where $(x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ is [ *any*]{}\nelement of the equivalence class representing $p$. This definition makes\nsense because other elements of the same equivalence class have the form\n$$(y_0,y_1,\\ldots,y_n)=(\\lambda x_0,\\lambda x_1,\\ldots,\\lambda x_n)$$\nfor some non-zero $\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb{K}}$, and hence\n$$\\frac{y_i}{y_0} = \\frac{x_i}{x_0}.$$\n\nThe functions $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ are called *affine coordinates* relative\nto the hyperplane $$H_0=\\{x_0=1\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}.$$\nGeometrically, affine coordinates can be described by saying that the\nelements of $A_0$ are lines in ${\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}$ that are not\nparallel to $H_0$, and that every such line intersects $H_0$ in one and\nexactly one point. Conversely points of $H_0$ are represented by tuples\n$(1,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ with $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\in{\\mathbb{K}}^n$, and each\nsuch point uniquely labels a line $[1:x_1:\\ldots:x_n]$ in $A_0$.\n\nIt must be noted that a single system of affine coordinates does not\ncover [*all*]{} of projective space. However, it is possible to define a\nsystem of affine coordinates relative to every hyperplane in\n${\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}$ that does not contain the origin. In particular, we\nget $n+1$ different systems of affine coordinates corresponding to the\nhyperplanes $\\{ x_i = 1\\},\\; i=0,1,\\ldots,n.$ Every element of\nprojective space is covered by at least one of these $n+1$ systems of\ncoordinates.\n\n#### Projective automorphisms.\n\nA projective automorphism, also known as a projectivity, is a bijective\ntransformation of projective space that preserves all incidence\nrelations. For $n\\geq 2$, every automorphism of\n${{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n$ is engendered by a semilinear invertible\ntransformation of ${\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}$. Let\n$A:{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}$ be an invertible\nsemilinear transformation. The corresponding projectivity\n$[A]:{{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n\\rightarrow{{\\mathbb{K}\\mathrm{P}}}^n$ is\nthe transformation $$[{\\mathbf{x}}] \\mapsto\n[A{\\mathbf{x}}],\\quad {\\mathbf{x}}\\in{\\mathbb{K}}^{n+1}.$$ For every\nnon-zero $\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb{K}}$ the transformation $\\lambda A$ gives\nthe same projective automorphism as $A$. For this reason, it is\nconvenient we identify the group of projective automorphisms with the\nquotient $${{\\operatorname{P\\Gamma L}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{K}}) =\n{\\operatorname{\\Gamma L}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{K}})/ {\\mathbb{K}}.$$ Here\n${\\operatorname{\\Gamma L}}$ refers to the group of invertible\nsemi-linear transformations, while the quotienting ${\\mathbb{K}}$ refers\nto the subgroup of scalar multiplications.\n\nA collineation is a special kind of projective automorphism, one that is\nengendered by a strictly linear transformation. The group of projective\ncollineations is therefore denoted by\n${{\\mathrm{PGL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{K}})$ Note that for fields such as\n${\\mathbb{R}}$ and ${\\mathbb{C}}$, the group of projective collineations\nis also described by the projectivizations\n${{\\mathrm{PSL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{R}}), {{\\mathrm{PSL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{C}})$,\nof the corresponding unimodular group.\n\nAlso note that if a field, such as ${\\mathbb{R}}$, lacks non-trivial\nautomorphisms, then all semi-linear transformations are linear. For such\nfields all projective automorphisms are collineations. Thus,\n$${{\\operatorname{P\\Gamma L}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{R}})={{\\mathrm{PSL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{R}})={{\\mathrm{SL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{R}})/\\{\\pm\\,\nI_{n+1}\\}.$$ By contrast, since ${\\mathbb{C}}$ possesses non-trivial\nautomorphisms, complex conjugation for example, the group of\nautomorphisms of complex projective space is larger than\n${{\\mathrm{PSL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{C}})$, where the latter denotes the\nquotient of ${{\\mathrm{SL}}}_{n+1}({\\mathbb{C}})$ by the subgroup of\nscalings by the $(n+1)$st roots of unity.",
