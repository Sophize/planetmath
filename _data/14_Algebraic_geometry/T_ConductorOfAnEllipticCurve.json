  "definition": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For each prime\n$p\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ define the quantity $f_p$ as follows: $$f_p =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 \\text{, if $E$ has good reduction at $p$,}\\\\\n1 \\text{, if $E$ has multiplicative reduction at $p$,}\\\\\n2 \\text{, if $E$ has additive reduction at $p$, and $p\\neq\n2,3$,}\\\\\n2+\\delta_p \\text{, if $E$ has additive reduction at $p=2\\ or\\ 3$.}\n\\end{cases}$$ where $\\delta_p$ depends on wild ramification in the\naction of the inertia group at $p$ of\n$\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})$ on the Tate module\n$T_p(E)$.\n\nThe conductor $N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}$ of ${E/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is defined to be:\n$$N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}=\\prod_p p^{f_p}$$ where the product is over all\nprimes and the exponent $f_p$ is defined as above.\n\nLet $E/\\mathbb{Q}\\colon y^2+y=x^3-x^2+2x-2$. The primes of bad reduction\nfor $E$ are $p=5$ and $7$. The reduction at $p=5$ is additive, while the\nreduction at $p=7$ is multiplicative. Hence\n$N_{E/\\mathbb{Q}}=25\\cdot 7 = 175$.\n\n[9]{} James Milne, [*Elliptic Curves*]{}, . Joseph H. Silverman, [*The\nArithmetic of Elliptic Curves*]{}. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1986.\nJoseph H.
