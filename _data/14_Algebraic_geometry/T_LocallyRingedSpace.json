That is,\n$$\\phi_p(y) \\in {\\mathfrak{m}}_p \\text{ for every } y \\in {\\mathfrak{m}}_{f(p)},$$\nwhere ${\\mathfrak{m}}_p$ (respectively, ${\\mathfrak{m}}_{f(p)}$) is the\nmaximal ideal of the ring $({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p$ (respectively,\n$({\\mathcal{O}}_Y)_{f(p)}$).\n\nApplications\n============\n\nLocally ringed spaces are encountered in many natural contexts.\nBasically, every sheaf on the topological space $X$ consisting of\ncontinuous functions with values in some field is a locally ringed\nspace. Indeed, any such function which is not zero at a point $p \\in X$\nis nonzero and thus invertible in some neighborhood of $p$, which\nimplies that the only maximal ideal of the stalk at $p$ is the set of\ngerms of functions which vanish at $p$. The utility of this definition\nlies in the fact that one can then form constructions in familiar\ninstances of locally ringed spaces which readily generalize in ways that\nwould not necessarily be obvious without this framework. For example,\ngiven a manifold $X$ and its locally ringed space $\\mathcal{D}_X$ of\nreal\u2013valued differentiable functions, one can show that the space of all\ntangent vectors to $X$ at $p$ is naturally isomorphic to the real vector\nspace $({\\mathfrak{m}}_p/{\\mathfrak{m}}_p^2)^*$, where the $^*$\nindicates the dual vector space. We then see that, in general, for\n[**any**]{} locally ringed space $X$, the space of tangent vectors at\n$p$ should be defined as the $k$\u2013vector space\n$({\\mathfrak{m}}_p/{\\mathfrak{m}}_p^2)^*$, where $k$ is the residue\nfield $({\\mathcal{O}}_X)_p / {\\mathfrak{m}}_p$ and $^*$ denotes dual\nwith respect to $k$ as before. It turns out that this definition is the\ncorrect definition even in esoteric contexts like algebraic geometry\nover finite fields which at first sight lack the differential structure\nneeded for constructions such as tangent vector.\n\nAnother useful application of locally ringed spaces is in the\nconstruction of schemes. The forgetful functor assigning to each locally\nringed space $(X,{\\mathcal{O}}_X)$ the ring ${\\mathcal{O}}_X(X)$ is\nadjoint to the \u201cprime spectrum\u201d functor taking each ring $R$ to the\nlocally ringed space $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$, and this correspondence\nis essentially why the category of locally ringed spaces is the proper\nbuilding block to use in the formulation of the notion of scheme.\n\n[^1]: All rings mentioned in this article are required to be\n    commutative.",
