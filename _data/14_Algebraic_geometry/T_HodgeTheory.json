  "definition": "Hodge theory is a branch of algebraic geometry and complex manifold\ntheory that deals with the decomposition of the cohomology groups of an\ncomplex projective algebraic variety.\n\nLet $\\Omega^k(M)$ denote the space of differential $k$-forms. We know\nthat there is a map, called the exterior derivative\n$$d\\colon\\Omega^k \\rightarrow \\Omega^{k+1}$$ and that $d^2 = 0$. This\nforms a complex and the cohomology of this complex, $H_{DR}^* (M)$ is\ncalled the de Rham cohomology of $M$. It is isomorphic to the singular\ncohomology of $M$.\n\nFor a complex manifold, it is more natural to have complex coordinates\nfor our differential forms. Writing $z_j = x_j + iy_j$ we obtain two\n1-forms, $dz_j$ and $d\\bar{z_j}$. These forms serve as a basis for all\n$k$-forms,\n$dz_{i_1} \\wedge dz_{i_2} \\wedge \\dots\\wedge dz_{i_p} \\wedge d\\bar{z_{j_1}} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge d\\bar{z_{j_q}}$,\nwhere $p+q = k$. We call forms written like this to be $(p,q)$-forms.\nLet $\\Omega^{p,q}$ be the space of $(p,q)$-forms. Then we have a natural\ndecomposition $$\\Omega^k (M) = \\bigoplus _{p+q =k} \\Omega^{p,q}(M).$$\n\nThe question then becomes , does this decomposition pass to the level of\ncohomology? The answer in general is no. If it were true in general, it\nwould force all manifolds to have even first cohomology, which is\nobviously not true. But fortunately there are some nice classes of\nmanifolds for which is does hold.\n\nThe Laplacian opererator $\\Delta = d \\phi + \\phi d$ where $\\phi$ is the\nadjoint operator (with respect to the Riemannian metric) to $d$. A form\nis called harmonic if its Laplacian is 0. The motivation for considering\nthe Laplacian comes from looking for differential forms of minimal\nlength. Because a basis on $TM$ induces a basis on $T^*M$ then we have\nan metric on $\\bigwedge^kT^*M$ Due to this, we can define a norm on\n$\\Omega^k$. It turns out that for $\\lVert \\omega \\rVert$ to be minimal,\nthen $(\\omega , d\\gamma) = 0$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\Omega^{k-1}$. This is\nequivalent to $(\\phi \\omega , \\gamma ) = 0$. So a closed form with\nminimal norm is harmonic.\n\nThe most fundamental theorem of Hodge theory states that the space of\nharmonic $k$-forms, $H_{\\Delta}^k(M) \\cong H_{DR}^k (M)$.\n\nNow for local coordinates, a $1$-form is written as\n$ \\omega = \\sum f_i dz_i + \\sum g_j d\\bar{z_j}$. We define two new\noperators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$ such that\n$$\\partial \\omega = \\sum \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial z_k}dz_k \\wedge dz_i + \\sum \\frac{\\partial g_j}{\\partial z_k}dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z_j}$$\n$$\\bar{\\partial} \\omega = \\sum \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial \\bar{z_k}}d\\bar{z_k} \\wedge dz_i + \\sum \\frac{\\partial g_j}{\\partial \\bar{z_k}}dz_k \\wedge d\\bar{z_j}$$\nThese operators also satisfy the relations\n$\\partial^2 = \\bar{\\partial^2} = 0$ and\n$\\partial \\bar{\\partial} + \\bar{\\partial}\\partial = 0$. These operators\nalso have adjoints and they as well have the relation that\n$d = \\partial^* + \\bar{\\partial}^*$. Writing these in terms of the\nlaplacian we obtain that\n$$\\Delta = (\\partial \\partial^* + \\partial^* \\partial ) + (\\bar{\\partial}\\bar{\\partial}^* + \\bar{\\partial}^*\\bar{\\partial}) + \\mathbb{O}$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{O}$ denotes some cross terms. For this to be of any\ninterest to us in terms on Hodge theory, these cross terms must vanish.\nAssuming they do, then if a form is harmonic, then each of the\ncomponents of the $(p,q)$-form are harmonic. Therefore, we obtain a\ndecomposition of the space of harmonic forms\n$$H_{\\Delta}^k = \\bigoplus _{p+q = k} H_{\\Delta}^{p,q}$$. This gives us\na Hodge decomposition on the level of cohomology due to the isomorphism\nbetween the space of harmonic forms and the de Rham cohomology groups.\n\nThis has some immediate and interesting consequences. It tells us that\nany smooth complex projective variety has an even first betti number.\nWith some work, one could also show that the second cohomology group is\nnon-empty.\n\nWe worked under the assumption that the cross terms in the above\nexpression vanished. A example of a class of manifolds where this holds\ntrue is Kahler Manifolds, which are complex manifolds with a Riemannian\nmetric that is compatible with the complex structure.\n\nThis is just a small portion of the large topic of Hodge theory.",
