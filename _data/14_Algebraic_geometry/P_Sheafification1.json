  "statement": "Let $T$ be a site. Let $P_T$ denote the category of presheaves on $T$\n(with values in the category of abelian groups), and $S_T$ the category\nof sheaves on $T$. There is a natural inclusion functor\n$\\iota\\colon S_T \\to P_T$.\n\nThe functor $\\iota$ has a left adjoint $\\sharp\\colon P_T\\to S_T$, that\nis, for any sheaf $F$ and presheaf $G$, we have\n$$\\operatorname{Hom}_{S_T}(G^\\sharp,F)\\cong\\operatorname{Hom}_{P_T}(G,\\iota F).$$\nThis functor $\\sharp$ is called *sheafification*, and $G^\\sharp$ is\ncalled the *sheafification of $F$*.\n\nOne can readily check that this description in terms of adjoints\ncharacterizes $\\sharp$ completely, and that this definition reduces to\nthe usual definition of when $T$ is the Zariski site. It also allows\nderivation of various exactness properties of $\\sharp$ and $\\iota$.\n\n[9]{}",
