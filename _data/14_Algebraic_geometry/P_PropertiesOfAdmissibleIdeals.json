  "statement": "Let $Q$ be a quiver, $k$ a field and $I$ an admissible ideal (see parent\nobject) in the path algebra $kQ$. The following propositions and proofs\nare taken from [@ASS].\n\n**Proposition 1.** If $Q$ is finite, then $kQ/I$ is finite dimensional\nalgebra.\n\n*Proof.* Let $R_Q$ be the arrow ideal in $kQ$. Since $R_Q^m\\subseteq I$\nfor some $m$, then we have a surjective algebra homomorphism\n$kQ/R_Q^m\\to kQ/I$. Thus, it is enough to show, that $kQ/R_Q^m$ is\nfinite dimensional. But since $Q$ is a finite quiver, then there is\nfinitely many paths of length at most $m$. It is easy to see, that these\npaths form a basis of $kQ/R_Q^m$ as vector space over $k$. This\ncompletes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Proposition 2.** If $Q$ is finite, then $I$ is a finitely generated\nideal.\n\n*Proof.* Consider the short exact sequence $$\\xymatrix{\n0\\ar[r] & R_Q^m\\ar[r] & I\\ar[r] & I/R_Q^m\\ar[r] & 0\n}$$ of $kQ$ modules. It is well known that in such sequences the middle\nterm is finitely generated if the end terms are. Of course $R_Q^m$ is\nfinitely generated, because $Q$ is finite so there is finite number of\npaths of length $m$.\n\nOn the other hand $I/R_Q^m$ is an ideal in $kQ/R_Q^m$, which is finite\ndimensional by proposition 1. Thus $I/R_Q^m$ is a finite dimensional\nvector space over $k$. But then it is finitely generated $kQ$ module\n(see for more details), which completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Proposition 3.** If $Q$ is finite, then there exists a finite set of\n$\\{\\rho_1,\\ldots,\\rho_m\\}$ such that $I$ is generated by them.\n\n*Proof.* By proposition 2 there is a finite set of generators\n$\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}$ of $I$. Generally the don\u2019t have to be relations.\nOn the other hand, if $e_x$ denotes the stationary path in $x\\in Q_0$,\nthen it can be easily checked, that every element of the form\n$e_x\\cdot a_i\\cdot e_y$ is either zero or a relation. Also, note that\n$$a_i=\\sum_{x,y\\in Q_0}e_x\\cdot a_i\\cdot e_y.$$ Since $Q$ is finite,\nthen this completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n[99]{} I. Assem, D. Simson, A.
