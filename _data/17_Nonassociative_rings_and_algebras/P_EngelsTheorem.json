  "statement": "Before proceeding, it will be useful to recall the definition of a\nnilpotent Lie algebra. Let ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ be a Lie algebra. The lower\ncentral series of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is defined to be the filtration of\nideals\n$${\\mathcal{D}}_0{\\mathfrak{g}}\\supset {\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}\\supset {\\mathcal{D}}_2{\\mathfrak{g}}\\supset\\ldots,$$\nwhere\n$${\\mathcal{D}}_0{\\mathfrak{g}}= {\\mathfrak{g}},\\qquad {\\mathcal{D}}_{k+1}{\\mathfrak{g}}= [{\\mathfrak{g}},{\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{g}}],\\quad k\\in\n{\\mathbb{N}}.$$ To say that ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is nilpotent is to say that\nthe lower central series has a trivial termination, i.e. that there\nexists a $k$ such that $${\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{g}}= 0,$$ or\nequivalently, that $k$ nested bracket operations always vanish.\n\nLet ${\\mathfrak{g}}\\subset{\\mathop{\\mathrm{End}}\\nolimits}V$ be a Lie\nalgebra of endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.\nSuppose that all elements of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ are nilpotent\ntransformations. Then, ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra.\n\nLet $X:V\\rightarrow V$ be a nilpotent endomorphism of a vector space\n$V$. Then, the adjoint action\n$${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ad}}\\nolimits}(X):{\\mathop{\\mathrm{End}}\\nolimits}V\\rightarrow {\\mathop{\\mathrm{End}}\\nolimits}V$$\nis also a nilpotent endomorphism.\n\n#### Proof.\n\nSuppose that $$X^k=0$$ for some $k\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$. We will show that\n$${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ad}}\\nolimits}(X)^{2k-1}=0.$$ Note that\n$${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ad}}\\nolimits}(X) = l(X)-r(X),$$ where\n$$l(X), r(X):{\\mathop{\\mathrm{End}}\\nolimits}V\\rightarrow {\\mathop{\\mathrm{End}}\\nolimits}V,$$\nare the endomorphisms corresponding, respectively, to left and right\nmultiplication by $X$. These two endomorphisms commute, and hence we can\nuse the binomial formula to write\n$${\\mathop{\\mathrm{ad}}\\nolimits}(X)^{2k-1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2k-1} (-1)^i\\, l(X)^{2k-1-i}\\, r(X)^i.$$\nEach of terms in the above sum vanishes because $$l(X)^k = r(X)^k = 0.$$\nQED\n\nLet ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ be as in the theorem, and suppose, in addition,\nthat ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra. Then the joint kernel,\n$$\\ker {\\mathfrak{g}}= \\bigcap_{a\\in{\\mathfrak{g}}} \\ker a,$$ is\nnon-trivial.\n\n#### Proof.\n\nWe proceed by induction on the dimension of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. The claim\nis true for dimension 1, because then ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is generated by a\nsingle nilpotent transformation, and all nilpotent transformations are\nsingular.\n\nSuppose then that the claim is true for all Lie algebras of dimension\nless than $n=\\dim{\\mathfrak{g}}$. We note that\n${\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}$ fits the hypotheses of the lemma, and\nhas dimension less than $n$, because ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is nilpotent.\nHence, by the induction hypothesis\n$$V_0 = \\ker {\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}$$ is non-trivial. Now, if we\nrestrict all actions to $V_0$, we obtain a representation of\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$ by abelian transformations. This is because for all\n$a,b\\in{\\mathfrak{g}}$ and $v\\in V_0$ we have\n$$a b v-b a v = [a,b]v = 0 .$$ Now a finite number of mutually commuting\nlinear endomorphisms admits a mutual eigenspace decomposition. In\nparticular, if all of the commuting endomorphisms are singular, their\njoint kernel will be non-trivial. We apply this result to a basis of\n${\\mathfrak{g}}/{\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}$ acting on $V_0$, and the\ndesired conclusion follows. QED\n\n#### Proof of the theorem.\n\nWe proceed by induction on the dimension of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. The\ntheorem is true in dimension 1, because in that circumstance\n${\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}$ is trivial.\n\nNext, suppose that the theorem holds for all Lie algebras of dimension\nless than $n=\\dim{\\mathfrak{g}}$. Let\n${\\mathfrak{h}}\\subset{\\mathfrak{g}}$ be a properly contained subalgebra\nof minimum codimension. We claim that there exists an\n$a\\in{\\mathfrak{g}}$ but not in ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ such that\n$[a,{\\mathfrak{h}}]\\subset{\\mathfrak{h}}$.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ is nilpotent. To prove the\nclaim consider the isotropy representation of ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ on\n${\\mathfrak{g}}/{\\mathfrak{h}}$. By Lemma 1, the action of each\n$a\\in{\\mathfrak{h}}$ on ${\\mathfrak{g}}/{\\mathfrak{h}}$ is a nilpotent\nendomorphism. Hence, we can apply Lemma 2 to deduce that the joint\nkernel of all these actions is non-trivial, i.e. there exists a\n$a\\in{\\mathfrak{g}}$ but not in ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ such that\n$$[b,a]\\equiv 0 \\mod {\\mathfrak{h}},$$ for all $b\\in{\\mathfrak{h}}$.\nEquivalently, $[{\\mathfrak{h}},a]\\subset {\\mathfrak{h}}$ and the claim\nis proved.\n\nEvidently then, the span of $a$ and ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ is a subalgebra of\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$. Since ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ has minimum codimension, we\ninfer that ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ and $a$ span all of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$, and\nthat $$\\label{eq:g1inh}\n  {\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{g}}\\subset{\\mathfrak{h}}.$$\n\nNext, we claim that all the ${\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{h}}$ are ideals\nof ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. It is enough to show that\n$$[a,{\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{h}}]\\subset {\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{h}}.$$\nWe argue by induction on $k$. Suppose the claim is true for some $k$.\nLet $b\\in{\\mathfrak{h}}, c\\in{\\mathcal{D}}_k{\\mathfrak{h}}$ be given. By\nthe Jacobi identity $$[a,[b,c]] = [[a,b],c] + [b,[a,c]].$$ The first\nterm on the right hand-side in ${\\mathcal{D}}_{k+1}{\\mathfrak{h}}$\nbecause $[a,b]\\in{\\mathfrak{h}}$. The second term is in\n${\\mathcal{D}}_{k+1}{\\mathfrak{h}}$ by the induction hypothesis. In this\nway the claim is established.\n\nNow $a$ is nilpotent, and hence by Lemma 1, $$\\label{eq:adan}\n  {\\mathop{\\mathrm{ad}}\\nolimits}(a)^n=0$$ for some $n\\in {\\mathbb{N}}$.\nWe now claim that\n$${\\mathcal{D}}_{n+1}{\\mathfrak{g}}\\subset{\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{h}}.$$\nBy it suffices to show that $$[\\overbrace{{\\mathfrak{g}},[\\ldots\n  [{\\mathfrak{g}}}^{n\\text{ times}},{\\mathfrak{h}}]\\ldots ]]\\subset{\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{h}}.$$\nPutting\n$${\\mathfrak{g}}_1={\\mathfrak{g}}/{\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{h}},\\quad {\\mathfrak{h}}_1={\\mathfrak{h}}/{\\mathcal{D}}_1{\\mathfrak{h}},$$\nthis is equivalent to $$[\\overbrace{{\\mathfrak{g}}_1,[\\ldots\n  [{\\mathfrak{g}}_1}^{n\\text{ times}},{\\mathfrak{h}}_1]\\ldots ]]=0.$$\nHowever, ${\\mathfrak{h}}_1$ is abelian, and hence, the above follows\ndirectly from .\n\nAdapting this argument in the obvious fashion we can show that\n$${\\mathcal{D}}_{kn+1}{\\mathfrak{g}}\\subset{\\mathcal{D}}_k {\\mathfrak{h}}.$$\nSince ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ is nilpotent, ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ must be nilpotent\nas well. QED\n\n#### Historical remark.\n\nIn the traditional formulation of Engel\u2019s theorem, the hypotheses are\nthe same, but the conclusion is that there exists a basis $B$ of $V$,\nsuch that all elements of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ are represented by nilpotent\nmatrices relative to $B$.\n\nLet us put this another way. The vector space of nilpotent matrices\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{Nil}}\\nolimits}$, is a nilpotent Lie algebra, and\nindeed all subalgebras of ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{Nil}}\\nolimits}$ are\nnilpotent Lie algebras. Engel\u2019s theorem asserts that the converse holds,\ni.e. if all elements of a Lie algebra ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ are nilpotent\ntransformations, then ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is isomorphic to a subalgebra of\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{Nil}}\\nolimits}$.\n\nThe classical result follows straightforwardly from our version of the\nTheorem and from Lemma 2. Indeed, let $V_1$ be the joint kernel\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$. We then let $U_2$ be the joint kernel of\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$ acting on $V/V_0$, and let $V_2\\subset V$ be the\nsubspace obtained by pulling $U_2x$ back to $V$. We do this a finite\nnumber of times and obtain a flag of subspaces\n$$0=V_0\\subset V_1\\subset V_2\\subset \\ldots \\subset V_n=V,$$ such that\n$${\\mathfrak{g}}V_{k+1} = V_k$$ for all $k$. The choose an adapted basis\nrelative to this flag, and we\u2019re done.",
