  "definition": "Definition\n==========\n\nThe classical definition of a composition algebra is a non-associative\nalgebra $C$ over a field $k$ where\n\n1.  $C$ admits a non-degenerate quadratic form $q:C\\to k$, such that\n\n2.  $q$ is multiplicative: $q(xy)=q(x)q(y)$.\n\nWe also say $q$ permits composition or that it obeys the composition\nlaw.\n\nThis definition is geometric in that quadratic forms give rise to\ngeometric atributes for a vector space such as length, distance and\northogonality. Indeed, originally created over the real numbers such\nproperties seem appropriate for an algebra; however, concepts of length\nand distance are less appropriate over arbitrary fields and encourage a\nsecond equivalent definition based solely on the algebraic aspect of\nsuch algebras.\n\nAlternatively, a composition algebra can be defined as a unital\nalternative algebra $C$ over a field $k$ with an involution\n$x\\mapsto \\bar{x}$, that is an anti-isomorphism of order at most 2, such\nthat:\n\n1.  $C$ has no non-zero absolute zero divisors (that is, $(xa)x=0$ for\n    all $a\\in C$ implies $x=0$);\n\n2.  the norm $N(x):=x\\bar{x}$ is a scalar multiple of $1$, that is,\n    $N:C\\to k1$.\n\nThe first definition makes the composition property part of the\ndefinition but obscures the alternative multiplication as well as the\nexistence of an involutary anti-isomorphism for the algebra. The second\ndefinition makes both of these properties evident but obscures the\ncomposition property of the norm, and also hides the property that $N$\nis a quadratic form. However both definitions have merit, the first\ncaptures the classical view of an algebra respecting a certain geometric\ncondition while the second, introduced by Jacobson, promotes a purely\nalgebraic treatment. In our examples and constructions to follows we\nattempt to exhibit both aspects by supplying the norm, the involution,\nand the product.\n\nBoth definitions can be generalized to algebras over commutative unital\nrings $k$.\n\nRecall that a quadratic form gives rise to a symmetric bilinear from\n$b:C\\times C\\to k$ by $b(x,y)=q(x+y)-q(x)-q(y)$, for all $x,y\\in C$.\nSome of the immediate properties include:\n\n1.  $b(x,x)=2q(x)$,\n\n2.  $b(xz,yz)=b(x,y)q(z)$,\n\n3.  $b(xy,zw)+b(xw,zy)=b(x,y)b(z,w)$.\n\nThese strongly limit the structure of composition algebras and leads to\nthe celebrated theorem of Hurwitz (see Theorem \\[thm:Hurwitz\\]) which\nsuitably classifies the composition algebras over $\\mathbb{R}$. The work\nof many others including Albert, Dickson, Jacobson, and Kaplansky\nextended the essential conclussion of Hurwitz to all fields and the\nresulting generalization is still refered to as Hurwitz\u2019s theorem.\n\nThere are other algebras $A$ with norms $q:A\\to k$ which permit\ncomposition in the sense that $q(xy)=q(x)q(y)$. For example, alternative\nalgebras with involutions. However, the distinguishing property of\ncomposition algebras is that $q$ is a quadratic form. Classifications\nfor such norms have been caried out by Schafer and McCrimmon.\n\nNorms\n=====\n\nOriginally, composition algebras were created over the real numbers\n$k=\\mathbb{R}$. Here the usual positive definite norm on the real vector\nspace was used instead of the quadratic form (the square of the norm is\nthe quadratic form).\n\nThe first non-trivial example is the set of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$\nwith where $z=a+bi\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is assigned: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{z} & =& a-bi;\\\\\n|z| & = & |a+bi|=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\\sqrt{z\\bar{z}}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nMore interesting is the non-commutative algebra of Hamiltonians\n$\\mathbb{H}$, created by Hamilton, where each $x\\in\\mathcal{H}$ has the\nform $x=a+bi+cj+dk$ and $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x} & = & a-bi-cj-dk;\\\\\n|x| & = & |a+bi+cj+dk|=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}=\\sqrt{x\\bar{x}}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe last addition to the list was the non-associative algebra of\n*octonions* initially created by Cayley and the norm is simply\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\bar{x} & = & a-bi-cj-dk-fil-gjl-hkl;\\\\\n  |x|&=&|a+bi+cj+dk+el+fil+gjl+hkl| \\\\ \n     &=& \\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2+f^2+g^2+h^2}=\\sqrt{x\\bar{x}}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nBecause general fields do not sufficient squareroots, the use of norms\nin the classical Euclidean sense is replaced by the use of quadratic\nforms. Furthermore, the lack of ordering a field, such as a finite\nfield, introduces the need to use non-degenerate rather than positive\ndefinite conditions. Under these generalizations composition algebras\ncan be redefined form the classical context of composition algebras over\n$\\mathbb{R}$ to general composition algebras over arbitrary fields, as\ndone by our original definitions above. In this context, there are three\nfurther composition algebras over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet $C=\\mathbb{R}\\oplus\\mathbb{R}$ with $q(x,y)=xy$ for all\n$(x,y)\\in C$. Then $C$ is a composition algebra.\n\nEvidently $q(ax,ay)=a^2 q(x,y)$ and the polarization of $q$ is the\nsymmetric bilinear form $b((x,y),(z,w))=xz-yw$ for all\n$(x,y),(z,w)\\in C$ (so the signature is $(1,-1)$). Thus $q$ is a\nquadratic form.\n\nTo check that $q$ has the compositional property let $(x,y),(z,w)\\in C$.\nThen $$q((x,y)(z,w))\n    =q(xz,yw)=(xz)(yw)\n    =(xy)(zw)\n    =q(x,y)q(z,w).$$\n\nNote also that by defining $\\overline{(x,y)}=(y,x)$ then\n$(x,y)\\overline{(x,y)}\n=(xy,yx)=q(x,y)(1,1)$ and\n$b((x,y),(z,w))(1,1)=(x,y)(z,w)+\\overline{(x,y)(z,w)}$.\n\nLet $C=M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ with $q(X)=\\det X$ for all $X\\in C$. Then $C$ is\na composition algebra.\n\nLet $X\\in C$ and $a\\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then\n$q(aX)=\\det (aX)=\\det (aI_2)\\det X=a^2\\det X=a^2 q(X)$. It is also\nevident that if $X=\\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}$ then\nsetting $\\bar{X}=\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix}$ makes\n$(\\det X)I_2=X\\bar{X}$ and also $\\operatorname{T}(X)I_2=X+\\bar{X}$,\nwhere $\\operatorname{T}(X)$ is the trace of $X$. Hence\n$$\\begin{gathered}\nb(X,Y)=(q(X+Y)-q(X)-q(Y))I_2=(\\det (X+Y))I_2-(\\det X) I_2-(\\det Y) I_2\\\\\n  =(X+Y)\\overline{(X+Y)} - X \\bar{X} - Y\\bar{Y}\\\\\n  =Y\\bar{X}+X\\bar{Y}\n  =\\operatorname{T}(X\\bar{Y})I_2.\\end{gathered}$$ Therefore,\n$b(X,Y)=\\operatorname{T}(X\\bar{Y})$. Since\n$\\operatorname{T}(X\\bar{Y})=\\operatorname{T}(\\bar{Y}X)=\\operatorname{T}(X\\bar{Y})$,\nit follows that $b$ is a symmetric bilinear form and so $q$ is quadratic\nform.\n\nFinally, for composition note $$q(XY)\n    = \\det(XY)\n    = det X\\det Y\n    = q(X)q(Y).$$ Therefore $C$ is a composition algebra.\n\nThis gives two new composition algebras over $\\mathbb{R}$ and indeed\nthere is a third, constructed below as the algebra\n${\\left(\\frac{1,1,1}{\\mathbb{R}}\\right)}$, which is 8-dimensional and\nnon-associative but unlike the octonions, it has non-trivial\nzero-divisors.\n\nA composition algebra is *split* if the quadratic form is isotropic.\n\nThe example of $\\mathbb{R}\\oplus\\mathbb{R}$ and $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ just\ngiven are both examples of split composition algebras.\n\nInvolution\n==========\n\nDefine $$\\bar{x} := b(x,1)1 - x,\\qquad \\forall x\\in C.$$ Immediately it\nfollows that: for all $x,y\\in C$,\n\n1.  $\\overline{\\bar{x}}=x$,\n\n2.  $\\overline{x+y}=\\bar{x}+\\bar{y}$,\n\n3.  $\\bar{1}=1$.\n\nDefine the *trace* of $x$ as $T(x)=x+\\bar{x}$ and the *norm* of $x$ as\n$N(x)=\\bar{x}x$. Then it follows that:\n$$x^2-T(x)x+N(x)=0,\\qquad \\forall x\\in C.$$ So $C$ is a *quadratic*\nalgebra since every element in $x$ has at most a quadratic minimal\npolynomial. In fact $N(x)$ is a quadratic form allowing composition.\n\nConstructing composition algebras\n=================================\n\nAll of the following are composition algebras. [@Schafer:nonass III.4]\n\n$\\dim 1$:\n\n:   $k$, with trivial involution $x=\\bar{x}$ for all $x$ in $k$.\n\n$\\dim 2$:\n\n:   For any $\\alpha\\in k$, a *quadratic* extension of $k$, that is\n    $${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right)}=\\langle 1,i | i^2=\\alpha\\rangle.$$\n    Here $\\{1,i\\}$ is a basis and has an involution defined by\n    $\\bar{1}=1$ and $\\bar{i}=-i$.\n\n$\\dim 4$:\n\n:   For any $\\alpha,\\beta\\in k$, a *quaternion* algebra over $k$ defined\n    as\n    $${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta}{k}\\right)}=\\langle 1,i,j | i^2=\\alpha, j^2=\\beta, ij=-ji\\rangle$$\n    Then $\\{1,i,j,ij\\}$ forms a basis.[^1] An involution is defined by\n    $\\bar{1}=1$, $\\bar{i}=-i$, $\\bar{j}=-j$ and extended linearly.\n\n$\\dim 8$:\n\n:   For any $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\in k$, an *octonion* algebra over $k$:\n    $$\\begin{gathered}\n    {\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}{k}\\right)}=\n    \\langle 1,i,j,l | i^2=\\alpha, j^2=\\beta, l^2=\\gamma,\\quad\n        ij=-ji, il=-li, jl=-lj, \\\\\n        i(lj)=-l(ij), (li)j=l(ji), (li)(lj)=-\\gamma ji\n        \\rangle.\\end{gathered}$$ The set $\\{1,i,j,ij,l,il,jl,ijl\\}$ is a\n    basis. An involution is defined by $\\bar{1}=1$, $\\bar{i}=-i$,\n    $\\bar{j}=-j$, $\\bar{l}=-l$ and extended linearly.\n\nEach of these algebras can be realized by the Cayley-Dickson method\nwhich takes $C$ an associative $k$-algebra with involution and produces\nfor each $\\alpha\\in C-\\{0\\}$ a new algebra\n${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{C}\\right)}$ on the vector space $C\\oplus C$ with\nproduct $$(a,b)(c,d)=(ac+\\alpha d \\bar{b},\\bar{a}d+cb).$$ Set the\ninvolution on ${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{C}\\right)}$ to be\n$\\overline{(a,b)}=(\\bar{a},-b)$.\n\nThe algebras are equipped with a *trace* $Tr(x)=x+\\bar{x}$, and *norm*\n$N(x)=x\\bar{x}$. This norm serves as the quadratic map to establish\nthese algebras a composition algebras. The images of the trace and norm\nlie in $k$.\n\nThe new algebra is associative only if $C$ is commutative, otherwise it\nis alternative. This means that\n$\\displaystyle k, {\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right)},{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta}{k}\\right)}$\nare the associative composition algebras.\n\nAn algebra is a *division* algebra if the only zero-divisor is $0$\n[@Schafer:nonass II.2]. A central simple composition algebra with a\nnon-trivial zero-divisor is called a *split* composition algebra. Finite\ndimensional split central simple composition algebras are unique up to\nisomorphism to one of\n$$k,\\quad {\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)}\\cong k\\oplus k,\\quad {\\left(\\frac{1,1}{k}\\right)}\\cong M_2(k),\n\\quad {\\left(\\frac{1,1,1}{k}\\right)}.$$\n\nClassification theorem\n======================\n\n\\[thm:Hurwitz\\][@jac Theorem 6.2.3] A composition algebra $C$ over a\nfield $k$ with quadratic form $q(x)=x\\bar{x}$ is isomorphic to one of\nthe following:\n\n(i) A purely inseparable extension field $E/F$ of characteristic $2$ and\n    exponent $1$ (trivial involution) so $q(x)=x^2$.\n\n(ii) $k$ with trivial involution, so $q(x)=x^2$,\n\n(iii) Quadratic composition algebra: ${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{k}\\right)}$\n    for $\\alpha\\in k$,\n\n(iv) Quaternion algebra: ${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta}{k}\\right)}$ for\n    $\\alpha,\\beta\\in k$,\n\n(v) Octonion algebra: ${\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}{k}\\right)}$ for\n    $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma\\in k$.\n\nIn particular, all composition algebras over $k$, save perhaps those of\ntype $(i)$, are finite dimensional and of dimension $1$, $2$, $4$ or\n$8$.\n\n[7]{} T.Y.
