  "definition": "If $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a semi-simple Lie algebra, then we say that an\nrepresentation $V$ has highest weight $\\lambda$, if there is a vector\n$v\\in V_\\lambda$, the weight space of $\\lambda$, such that $Xv=0$ for\n$X$ in any positive root space, and $v$ is called a [*highest\nvector*]{}, or [*vector of highest weight*]{}.\n\nThere is a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible finite dimensional\nrepresentation of $\\mathfrak{g}$ with highest weight $\\lambda$ for any\ndominant weight $\\lambda\\in\\Lambda_W$, where $\\Lambda_W$ is the weight\nlattice of $\\mathfrak{g}$, and every irreducible representation of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ is of this type.",
