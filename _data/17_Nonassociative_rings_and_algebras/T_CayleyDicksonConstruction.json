  "definition": "In the foregoing discussion, an algebra shall mean a non-associative\nalgebra.\n\nLet $A$ be a normed $*$-algebra, an algebra admitting an $*$, over a\ncommutative ring $R$ with $1\\neq0$. The Cayley-Dickson construction is a\nway of enlarging $A$ to a new algebra, $KD(A)$, extending the $*$ as\nwell as the norm operations in $A$, such that $A$ is a subalgebra of\n$KD(A)$.\n\nDefine $KD(A)$ to be the module (external) direct sum of $A$ with\nitself: $$KD(A):=A\\oplus A.$$ Therefore, addition in $KD(A)$ is defined\nby addition componentwise in each copy of $A$. Next, let $\\lambda$ be a\nunit in $R$ and define three additional operations:\n\n1.  (Multiplication)\n    $(a\\oplus b)(c\\oplus d):=(ac+\\lambda d^*b)\\oplus(da+bc^*)$, where\n    $*$ is the involution on $A$,\n\n2.  (Extended involution) $(a\\oplus b)^*:=a^*\\oplus(-b)$, and\n\n3.  (Extended Norm) $N(a\\oplus b):=(a\\oplus b)(a\\oplus b)^*$.\n\nOne readily checks that the multiplication is bilinear, since the\ninvolution $*$ (on $A$) is linear. Therefore, $KD(A)$ is an algebra.\n\nFurthermore, since the extended involution $*$ is clearly bijective and\nlinear, and that\n$${(a\\oplus b)}^{**}=(a^*\\oplus(-b))^*=a^{**}\\oplus b=a\\oplus b,$$ this\nextended involution is well-defined and so $KD(A)$ is in addition a\n$*$-algebra.\n\nFinally, to see that $KD(A)$ is a normed $*$-algebra, we identify $A$ as\nthe first component of $KD(A)$, then $A$ becomes a subalgebra of $KD(A)$\nand elements of the form $a\\oplus0$ can now be written simply as $a$.\nNow, the extended norm\n$$N(a\\oplus b)=(a\\oplus b)(a^*\\oplus(-b))=(aa^*-\\lambda b^*b)\\oplus0=N(a)-\\lambda N(b)\\in A,$$\nwhere $N$ in the subsequent terms of the above equation array is the\nnorm on $A$ given by $N(a)=aa^*$. The fact that the\n$N\\colon KD(A)\\to A$, together with the equality $N(0\\oplus0)=0$ show\nthat the extended norm $N$ on $KD(A)$ is well-defined. Thus, $KD(A)$ is\na normed $*$-algebra.\n\nThe normed $*$-algebra $KD(A)$, together with the invertible element\n$\\lambda\\in R$, is called the *Cayley-Dickson algebra*, $KD(A,\\lambda)$,\n*obtained from $A$*.\n\nIf $A$ has a unity 1, then so does $KD(A,\\lambda)$ and its unity is\n$1\\oplus0$. Furthermore, write $i=0\\oplus1$, we check that,\n$ia=(0\\oplus1)(a\\oplus0)=0\\oplus a^*=(a^*\\oplus0)(0\\oplus1)=a^*i$.\nTherefore, $iA=Ai$ and we can identify the second component of\n$KD(A,\\lambda)$ with $Ai$ and write elements of $Ai$ as $ai$ for\n$a\\in A$.\n\nIt is not hard to see that $A(Ai)=(Ai)A\\subseteq Ai$ and\n$(Ai)(Ai)\\subseteq A$. We are now able to write\n$$KD(A,\\lambda)=A\\oplus Ai,$$ where each element $x\\in KD(A,\\lambda)$\nhas a unique expression $x=a+bi$.\n\n**Properties**. Let $x,y,z$ will be general elements of $KD(A,\\lambda)$.\n\n1.  $(xy)^*=y^*x^*$,\n\n2.  $x+x^*\\in A$,\n\n3.  $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$.\n\n**Examples**. All examples considered below have ground ring the reals\n$\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n-   $KD(\\mathbb{R},-1)=\\mathbb{C}$, the complex numbers.\n\n-   $KD(\\mathbb{C},-1)=\\mathbb{H}$, the quaternions.\n\n-   $KD(\\mathbb{H},-1)=\\mathbb{O}$, the octonions.\n\n-   $KD(\\mathbb{O},-1)=\\mathbb{S}$, which are called the *sedenions*, an\n    algebra of dimension 16 over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  Starting from $\\mathbb{R}$, notice each stage of Cayley-Dickson\n    construction produces a new algebra that loses some intrinsic\n    properties of the previous one: $\\mathbb{C}$ is no longer orderable\n    (or formally real); commutativity is lost in $\\mathbb{H}$;\n    associativity is gone from $\\mathbb{O}$; and finally, $\\mathbb{S}$\n    is not even a division algebra anymore!\n\n2.  More generally, given any field $k$, any algebra obtained by\n    applying the Cayley-Dickson construction twice to $k$ is called a\n    *quaternion algebra* over $k$, of which $\\mathbb{H}$ is an example.\n    In other words, a quaternion algebra has the form\n    $$KD(KD(k,\\lambda_1),\\lambda_2),$$ where each\n    $\\lambda_i \\in k^*:=k-\\lbrace 0 \\rbrace$. Any algebra obtained by\n    applying the Cayley-Dickson construction three times to $k$ is\n    called a *Cayley algebra*, of which $\\mathbb{O}$ is an example. In\n    other words, a Cayley algebra has the form\n    $$KD(KD(KD(k,\\lambda_1),\\lambda_2),\\lambda_3),$$ where each\n    $\\lambda_i\\in k^*$. A Cayley algebra is an *octonion algebra* when\n    $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=-1$.\n\n[6]{} Richard D.
