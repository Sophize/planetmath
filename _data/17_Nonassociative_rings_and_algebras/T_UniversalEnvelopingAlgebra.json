  "definition": "A [*universal enveloping algebra*]{} of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$\nover a field $k$ is an associative $U$ (with unity) over $k$, together\nwith a Lie algebra homomorphism $\\iota:\\mathfrak{g} \\rightarrow U$\n(where the Lie algebra structure on $U$ is given by the commutator),\nsuch that if $A$ is a another associative algebra over $k$ and\n$\\phi:\\mathfrak{g}\n\\rightarrow A$ is another Lie algebra homomorphism, then there exists a\nunique homomorphism $\\psi:U \\rightarrow A$ of associative algebras such\nthat the diagram $$\\xymatrix{\n  \\mathfrak{g} \\ar[dr]_\\phi \\ar[r]^\\iota & U \\ar[d]^\\psi\\\\\n                                         & A}$$ commutes. Any\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ has a universal enveloping algebra: let $T$ be the\nassociative tensor algebra generated by the vector space $\\mathfrak{g}$,\nand let $I$ be the two-sided ideal of $T$ generated by elements of the\nform $$xy-yx-[x,y] \\text{ for } x,y \\in \\mathfrak{g};$$ then $U=T/I$ is\na universal enveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$. Moreover, the\nuniversal property above ensures that all universal enveloping algebras\nof $\\mathfrak{g}$ are canonically isomorphic; this justifies the\nstandard notation $U(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nSome remarks:\n\n1.  By the Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, the map $\\iota$ is injective;\n    usually $\\mathfrak{g}$ is identified with $\\iota(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n    From the construction above it is clear that this space generates\n    $U(\\mathfrak{g})$ as an associative algebra with unity.\n\n2.  By definition, the (left) representation theory of $U(\\mathfrak{g})$\n    is identical to that of $\\mathfrak{g}$. In particular, any\n    irreducible $\\mathfrak{g}$-module corresponds to a maximal left\n    ideal of $U(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nExample: let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra generated by the elements\n$p,q,$ and $e$ with Lie bracket determined by $[p,q]=e$ and\n$[p,e]=[q,e]=0$. Then $U(g)/(e-1)$ (where $(e-1)$ denotes the two-sided\nideal generated by $e-1$) is isomorphic to the skew polynomial algebra\n$k[x,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}]$, the isomorphism being determined by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n        p + (e-1) &\\mapsto \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\text{ and}\\\\\n        q + (e-1) &\\mapsto x.\\end{aligned}$$",
