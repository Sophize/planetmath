  "definition": "Let $A$ be a non-associative algebra over a field. The *associator* of\n$A$, denoted by $[\\ , , ]$, is a map from $A\\times A\\times A$ to $A$\ngiven by: $$[\\ a,b,c\\ ]=(ab)c-a(bc).$$\n\nJust as the commutator measures how close an algebra is to being\ncommutative, the associator measures how close it is to being\nassociative. $[\\ , , ]=0$ identically iff $A$ is associative.\n\n[8]{} R. D. Schafer, [*An Introduction on Nonassociative Algebras*]{},\nDover, New York (1995).",
