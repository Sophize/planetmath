  "definition": "Let ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ be a semi-simple Lie algebra, ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ a\nCartan subalgebra, and ${\\mathfrak{b}}$ a Borel subalgebra. We work over\na field $F$. Given a weight $\\lambda \\in {\\mathfrak{h}}^*$, let\n$F_{\\lambda}$ be the 1-d dimensional ${\\mathfrak{b}}$-module on which\n${\\mathfrak{h}}$ acts by multiplication by $\\lambda$, and the positive\nroot spaces act trivially. Now, the Verma module $M_\\lambda$ of the\nweight $\\lambda$ is the ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-module induced from\n$F_\\lambda$, i.e.\n\n$$M_\\lambda = \\mathcal{U}({\\mathfrak{g}}) \\otimes_{\\mathcal{U}({\\mathfrak{b}})} F_\\lambda.$$\n\nUsing the Poincar\u00c3\u00a9-Birkhoff-Witt theorem we see that as a vector space\n$M_\\lambda$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{U}(\\overline{{\\mathfrak{n}}})$,\nwhere $\\overline{{\\mathfrak{n}}}$ is the sum of the negative weight\nspaces (so\n${\\mathfrak{g}} = {\\mathfrak{b}} \\oplus \\overline{{\\mathfrak{n}}})$. In\nparticular $M_\\lambda$ is infinite dimensional.\n\nWe say a ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-module $V$ is a highest weight module if it\nhas a weight $\\mu \\in {\\mathfrak{h}}^*$ and a non-zero vector\n$v \\in V_\\mu$ with $Xv = 0$ for any $X$ in a positive root space and\nsuch that $V$ is generated as a ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-module by $v$. The\nVerma module $M_\\lambda$ is a highest weight module and we fix a\ngenerator $1 \\otimes 1$.\n\nThe most important property of Verma modules is that they are universal\namongst highest weight modules, in the following sense. If $V$ is a\nhighest weight module generated by $v$ which has weight $\\lambda$ then\nthere is a unique surjective homomorphism $M_\\lambda\\to V$ which sends\n$1 \\otimes 1$ to $v$. That is, all highest weight modules with highest\nweight $\\lambda$ are quotients of $M_\\lambda$. Also, $M_\\lambda$ has a\nunique maximal submodule, so there is a unique irreducible\nrepresentation with highest weight $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda$ is dominant\nand integral then this module is finite dimensional.",
