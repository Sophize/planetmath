  "definition": "Let $A$ be a non-associative algebra. A subalgebra $B$ of $A$ is said to\nbe *cyclic* if it is generated by one element.\n\nA non-associative algebra is *power-associative* if, $[B,B,B]=0$ for any\ncyclic subalgebra $B$ of $A$, where $[-,-,-]$ is the associator.\n\nIf we inductively define the powers of an element $a\\in A$ by\n\n1.  (when $A$ is unital with $1\\neq0$) $a^0:=1$,\n\n2.  $a^1:=a$, and\n\n3.  $a^n:=a(a^{n-1})$ for $n>1$,\n\nthen power-associativity of $A$ means that $[a^i,a^j,a^k]=0$ for any\nnon-negative integers $i,j$ and $k$, since the associator is trilinear\n(linear in each of the three coordinates). This implies that\n$a^ma^n=a^{m+n}$. In addition, $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$.\n\nA theorem, due to A. Albert, states that any finite power-associative\ndivision algebra over the integers of characteristic not equal to 2, 3,\nor 5 is a field. This is a generalization of the Wedderburn\u2019s Theorem on\nfinite division rings.\n\n[8]{} R. D. Schafer, [*An Introduction on Nonassociative Algebras*]{},\nDover, New York (1995).",
