  "definition": "A [*Lie algebra*]{} over a field $k$ is a vector space $\\mathfrak{g}$\nwith a bilinear map\n$[\\ ,\\ ] : \\mathfrak{g}\\times\\mathfrak{g}\\to\\mathfrak{g}$, called the\n[*Lie bracket*]{} and denoted $(x,y)\\mapsto [x,y]$. It is required to\nsatisfy:\n\n1.  $[x,x] = 0$ for all $x\\in\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n2.  The [*Jacobi identity*]{}: $[x,[y,z]] + [y,[z,x]] + [z,[x,y]] = 0$\n    for all $x,y,z\\in\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nSubalgebras & Ideals\n====================\n\nA vector subspace ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ of the Lie algebra ${\\mathfrak{g}}$\nis a [*subalgebra*]{} if ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ is closed under the Lie\nbracket operation, or, equivalently, if ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ itself is a Lie\nalgebra under the same bracket operation as ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. An\n[*ideal*]{} of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is a subspace ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ for which\n$[x,y] \\in {\\mathfrak{h}}$ whenever either $x \\in {\\mathfrak{h}}$ or\n$y \\in {\\mathfrak{h}}$. Note that every ideal is also a subalgebra.\n\nSome general examples of subalgebras:\n\n-   The [*center*]{} of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$, defined by\n    $Z({\\mathfrak{g}}) := \\{x \\in {\\mathfrak{g}}\\mid [x,y] = 0 \\text{for all } y \\in {\\mathfrak{g}}\\}$.\n    It is an ideal of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$.\n\n-   The [*normalizer*]{} of a subalgebra ${\\mathfrak{h}}$ is the set\n    $N({\\mathfrak{h}}) := \\{x \\in {\\mathfrak{g}}\\mid [x,{\\mathfrak{h}}] \\subset {\\mathfrak{h}}\\}$.\n    The Jacobi identity guarantees that $N({\\mathfrak{h}})$ is always a\n    subalgebra of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$.\n\n-   The [*centralizer*]{} of a subset $X \\subset {\\mathfrak{g}}$ is the\n    set $C(X) := \\{x \\in {\\mathfrak{g}}\\mid [x,X] = 0\\}$. Again, the\n    Jacobi identity implies that $C(X)$ is a subalgebra of\n    ${\\mathfrak{g}}$.\n\nHomomorphisms\n=============\n\nGiven two Lie algebras ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ and ${\\mathfrak{g}}'$ over the\nfield $k$, a [*homomorphism*]{} from ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ to\n${\\mathfrak{g}}'$ is a linear transformation\n$\\phi: {\\mathfrak{g}}\\to {\\mathfrak{g}}'$ such that\n$\\phi([x,y]) = [\\phi(x),\\phi(y)]$ for all $x,y \\in {\\mathfrak{g}}$. An\ninjective homomorphism is called a [*monomorphism*]{}, and a surjective\nhomomorphism is called an [*epimorphism*]{}.\n\nThe [*kernel*]{} of a homomorphism\n$\\phi: {\\mathfrak{g}}\\to {\\mathfrak{g}}'$ (considered as a linear\ntransformation) is denoted $\\ker(\\phi)$. It is always an ideal in\n${\\mathfrak{g}}$.\n\nExamples\n========\n\n-   Any vector space can be made into a Lie algebra simply by setting\n    $[x,y] = 0$ for all vectors $x,y$. The resulting Lie algebra is\n    called an [*abelian*]{} Lie algebra.\n\n-   If $G$ is a Lie group, then the tangent space at the identity forms\n    a Lie algebra over the real numbers.\n\n-   $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the cross product operation is a nonabelian\n    three dimensional Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHistorical Note\n===============\n\nLie algebras are so-named in honour of Sophus Lie, a Norwegian\nmathematician who pioneered the study of these mathematical objects.\nLie\u2019s discovery was tied to his investigation of continuous\ntransformation groups and symmetries. One joint project with Felix Klein\ncalled for the classification of all finite-dimensional groups acting on\nthe plane. The task seemed hopeless owing to the generally non-linear\nnature of such group actions. However, Lie was able to solve the problem\nby remarking that a transformation group can be locally reconstructed\nfrom its corresponding \u201cinfinitesimal generators\u201d, that is to say vector\nfields corresponding to various 1-parameter subgroups. In terms of this\ngeometric correspondence, the group composition operation manifests\nitself as the bracket of vector fields, and this is very much a linear\noperation. Thus the task of classifying group actions in the plane\nbecame the task of classifying all finite-dimensional Lie algebras of\nplanar vector field; a project that Lie brought to a successful\nconclusion.\n\nThis \u201clinearization trick\u201d proved to be incredibly fruitful and led to\ngreat advances in geometry and differential equations. Such advances are\nbased, however, on various results from the theory of Lie algebras. Lie\nwas the first to make significant contributions to this purely algebraic\ntheory, but he was surely not the last.",
