  "definition": "If $R\\subset E$ is a root system, with $E$ an Euclidean vector space,\nthen a subset $R^+\\subset R$ is called a set of positive roots if there\nis a vector $v\\in E$ such that $(\\alpha ,v)>0$ if $\\alpha\\in R^+$, and\n$(\\alpha ,v)<0$ if $\\alpha\\in R\\backslash R^+$. which are not positive\nare called *negative*. Since $-\\alpha$ is negative if and only if\n$\\alpha$ is positive, exactly half the must be positive.",
