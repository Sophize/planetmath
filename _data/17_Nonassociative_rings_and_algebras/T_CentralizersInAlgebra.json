  "definition": "Abstract definitions and properties\n===================================\n\nLet $S$ be a set with a binary operation $*$. Let $T$ be a subset of\n$S$. Then define the *centralizer* in $S$ of $T$ as the subset\n$$C_S(T)=\\{ s\\in S : s*t=t*s, \\textnormal{ for all } t\\in T\\}.$$ The\n*center* of $S$ is defined as $C_S(S)$. This is commonly denoted $Z(S)$\nwhere $Z$ is derived from the German word *zentral*. Subsets and\nelements of the center are called *central*.\n\nIf we regard $*:S\\times S\\to S$ in the of actions we can perscribe a\nleft action $s*t$ and a right action $t*s$. The centralizer is thus the\nset of elements for which the left regular action and the right regular\naction agree when to $T$.\n\nIt is generally possible to have $s*t$ not lie in $T$ for $s\\in C_S(T)$\nand $t\\in T$, and likewise, it is also possible that if $s,s'\\in C_S(T)$\nthat $s*s'\\neq s'*s$. Therefore it should not be presumed that the\ncentralizer is central.\n\nWith further axioms on the of operation we can deduce certain natural\nfor the set $C_S(T)$.\n\n1.  If $A\\subseteq B$, then $C_S(B)\\subseteq C_S(A)$. In particular,\n    $C_S(\\varnothing)=S$.\n\n2.  If $S$ has an identity then $C_S(T)$ is non-empty. In particular, in\n    this case $Z(S)$ is non-empty. [^1]\n\n3.  If $S$ is associative and $s,s'\\in C_S(T)$ then $s*s'\\in C_S(T)$, we\n    say then that $C_S(T)$ is closed to the binary operation of $S$.\n\n4.  If $s\\in C_S(T)$ and $s$ has an (strong) inverse $s^{-1}$, then\n    $s^{-1}\\in C_S(T)$.[^2]\n\n5.  If $S$ is commutative then $C_S(T)=S$.\n\n6.  If $T$ is a subset of the center of $S$ then $C_S(T)=S$.\n\nNote that it is possible for $C_S(T)$ be a subset closed to the\nopertaion without the assumption of associativity, as for example, when\n$S$ is commutative.\n\nCentralizers in groups\n======================\n\nIn the category of groups the centralizer in a group $G$ of a subset $H$\ncan be redefined as:\n$$C_G(H)=\\{ g\\in G : g^{-1} h g=h, \\textnormal{ for all } h\\in H\\}.$$ If\none regards conjugation as a group action $h^g:=g^{-1} hg$ then it\nfollows that the centralizer is the same as the pointwise stabilizer in\n$G$ of $H$, where the action is of $G$ on itself by conjugation. Because\nof this overlap, in some contexts the centralizers is applied to the\npointwise stabilizer of a set on which a group acts, though this context\nno longer refers to the action of conjugation. This is espeically common\nwhen there is a need to distinguish between the pointwise stabilizer and\nthe setwise stabilizer.\n\nIn this category, the centralizer is always a subgroup of $G$.\nFurthermore, if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then so too is\n$C_G(H)$.\n\nCentralizers in rings and algebras\n==================================\n\nFor we treat rings as algebras over $\\mathbb{Z}$ and now speak only of\nalgebras, which will include nonassociative examples.\n\nIn an algebra $A$ there is in fact two binary operations on the set $A$\nin question. Thus the abstract definition of the centralizer is\nambiguous. However, the additive operation of rings and algebras is\nalways commutative and so any centralizer with respect to this operation\nis the set $A$. Thus it is generally accepted practice to assume that\ncentralizers in this context always refer to the multiplicative\noperation. In this way we have the following properties.\n\nGiven an algebra $A$ over a commutative unital ring $R$ and a subset $B$\nof $A$, then\n\n1.  $C_A(B)$ is a submodule of $A$.\n\n2.  If $A$ is associative then $C_A(B)$ is a subalgebra.\n\n3.  $Z(A)\\leq C_A(B)$, in particular, if $A$ has a 1 then $1\\in C_A(B)$\n    and so $R$ embeds in $C_A(B)$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   A centralizer in an algebra is also called a commutant. This\n    terminology is mostly used in algebras of operators in functional\n    analysis.\n\n-   Let $R$ be a ring (or an algebra). For every ordered pair $(a,b)$ of\n    elements of $R$, we can define the *additive commutator* of $(a,b)$\n    to be the element $ab-ba$, written $[a,b]$. With this, one may\n    alternatively define the centralizer of a set $S\\subseteq R$ in a\n    ring $R$ as\n    $$C_R(S):=\\{ r\\in R\\mid [r,s]=0 \\textnormal{ for all }s\\in S \\}.$$\n    Of course, in this definition, two operations (multiplication and\n    subtraction) are needed instead of one. But the nice aspect about\n    this definition is that one can \u201cmeasure\u201d commutativity of a ring by\n    the additive commutation operation. For example, one can show that,\n    in a division ring, if every element additively commutes with every\n    additive commutator, then the ring must be a field.\n\nCentralizers in Lie algebras\n============================\n\nSuppose $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie aglebra over a commutative ring of\ncharacteristic not $2$. Given a subset $T$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$, then\n$[s,t]=-[t,s]$ for $s\\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $t\\in T$ from the axioms of a\nLie algebra multiplication. Therefore whenever $[s,t]=[t,s]$ it follows\nthat $-[t,s]=[t,s]$ so that $[t,s]=0$. This motivates the more common\nredefinition of the centralizer in a Lie algebra:\n$$C_{\\mathfrak{g}}(T)=\\{ s\\in \\mathfrak{g} : [s,t]=0, \\textnormal{ for all } t\\in T\\}.$$\nDespite the incongruety in characteristic 2, this new definition\nreplaces the original definition of centralizers for Lie algebras. The\ncentralizer of a Lie algebra is a subalgebra.\n\nWhen the Lie multiplication is regarded as a commutator, so\n$[a,b]=ab-ba$, for example it it universal enveloping algebra, then\n$0=[a,b]=ab-ba$ is the same as $ab=ba$ and so the centralizer of the Lie\nalgebra coincides with the centralizer of the associative envelope.\n\nCentralizers in other nonassociative algebras\n=============================================\n\nThe centralizer need not be a subalgebra on account of the lack of\nassociativity. There are instances of non-associative algebras where the\ncentralizer is however a subalgebra nontheless, for example, Lie\nalgebras as seen above. In travial fashion, if an algebra is commutative\nthen $C_A(B)=A$ and so the centralizer is a subalgebra but without any\nuseful properties. There is a suitable additional constraint to add to\ncentralizers to force them to be subalgebras and carry with them more\nuseful in the commutative but nonassociative setting.\n\nWe write $[a,b]$ for $ab-ba$, called the commutator in $A$ of $a,b\\in A$\nand also write $/a,b,c/$ for $(ab)c-a(bc)$ and call it the associator in\n$A$ of $a,b,c\\in A$.[^3] Then we can redefine the centralizer in $A$ of\na subset $T$ of $A$ as\n$$C_{A}(T)=\\{ s\\in A: [s,t]=0, /s',s,t/=/s',t,s/=/t,s',s/=0\\textnormal{ for all } t\\in T, s'\\in A\\}.$$\nIt follows that $C_A(T)$ is a subalgebra of $A$ on account of the added\nassociator condition which forces the subset to be closed to the\nproduct.\n\nIn alternative algebras, if any one of three associators is 0 then the\nother three are as well and so the definition reduces to $/s',s,t/=0$.\noccur of other nonassociative algebras.\n\n[^1]: An identity of $S$ is an element $e\\in S$ such that $e*s=s*e$ for\n    all $s\\in S$.\n\n[^2]: We say an inverse is strong if $s^{-1}*(s*t)=t=(t*s)*s^{-1}$ for\n    all $t\\in S$. If the operation is associative then this is given for\n    free. There are natural nonassociative operations with this\n    property, such as alternative algebras.\n\n[^3]: This notation for associators is non-standard but the standard\n    $[a,b,c]=(ab)c-a(bc)$ is likely confusing given the usual commutator\n    notation used already.",
