  "definition": "A *non-associative algebra* is an algebra in which the assumption of\nmultiplicative associativity is dropped. From this definition, a\nnon-associative algebra does not that the associativity fails. Rather,\nit enlarges the class of associative algebras, so that any associative\nalgebra is a non-associative algebra.\n\nIn much of the literature concerning non-associative algebras, where the\nmeaning of a \u201cnon-associative algebra\u201d is clear, the word\n\u201cnon-associative\u201d is dropped for simplicity and clarity.\n\nLie algebras and Jordan algebras are two famous examples of\nnon-associative algebras that are not associative.\n\nIf we substitute the word \u201calgebra\u201d with \u201cring\u201d in the above paragraphs,\nthen we arrive at the definition of a *non-associative ring*.\nAlternatively, a non-associative ring is just a non-associative algebra\nover the integers.\n\n[6]{} Richard D.
