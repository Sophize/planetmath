  "definition": "Let $R\\subseteq E$ be a root system, with $E$ a Euclidean . If $R^+$ is\na set of positive roots, then a root is called [*simple*]{} if it is\npositive, and not the sum of any two positive roots. The simple roots\nform a basis of the vector space $E$, and any positive root is a\npositive integer linear combination of simple roots.\n\nA set of roots which is simple with respect to some choice of a set of\npositive roots is called a [*base*]{}. The Weyl group of the root system\nacts simply transitively on the set of bases.",
