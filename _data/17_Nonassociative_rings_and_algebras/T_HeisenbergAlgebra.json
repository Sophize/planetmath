  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Let $M$ be a over $R$ by two sets\n$\\{P_i\\}_{i\\in\n  I}$ and $\\{Q_i\\}_{i\\in I}$, where $I$ is an index set, and a further\nelement $c$. Define a product $[\\cdot,\\cdot]\\colon M\\times M\\to M$ by\nbilinear extension by setting $$\\begin{gathered}\n[c,c]=[c,P_i]=[P_i,c]=[c,Q_i]=[Q_i,c]=[P_i,P_j]=[Q_i,Q_j]=0\\text{ for\nall }i,j\\in I,\\\\\n[P_i,Q_j]=[Q_i,P_j]=0\\text{ for all distinct }i,j\\in I,\\\\\n[P_i,Q_i]=-[Q_i,P_i]=c\\text{ for all }i\\in I.\\end{gathered}$$ The module\n$M$ together with this product is called a *Heisenberg algebra*. The\nelement $c$ is called the *central element*.\n\nIt is easy to see that the product $[\\cdot,\\cdot]$ also fulfills the\nJacobi identity, so a Heisenberg algebra is actually a Lie algebra of\nrank $|I|+1$ (opposed to the rank of $M$ as free module, which is\n$2|I|+1$) with one-dimensional center generated by $c$.\n\nHeisenberg algebras arise in quantum mechanics with $R={\\mathbb}{C}$ and\ntypically $I=\\{1,2,3\\}$, but also in the theory of vertex with\n$I={\\mathbb}{Z}$.\n\nIn the case where $R$ is a field, the Heisenberg algebra is related to a\nWeyl algebra: let $U$ be the universal enveloping algebra of $M$, then\nthe quotient $U/{\\langle}c-1{\\rangle}$ is isomorphic to the $|I|$-th\nWeyl algebra over $R$.",
