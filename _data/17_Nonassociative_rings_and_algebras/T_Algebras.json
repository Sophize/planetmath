  "definition": "Let $K$ be a commutative unital ring (often a field) and $A$ a\n$K$-module. Given a bilinear mapping $b:A\\times A\\rightarrow A$, we say\n$(K,A,b)$ is a $K$-algebra. We usually write only $A$ for the tuple\n$(K,A,b)$.\n\nMany authors and applications insist on $K$ as a field, or at least a\nlocal ring, or a semisimple ring. This enables $A$ to have some notion\nof dimension or rank.\n\nThis definition is a compact method to encode the property that our\nmultiplication is distributive: the multiplication is additive in both\nvariables translates to\n$$(a+b)c=ac+bc,\\qquad a(b+c)=ab+ac\\qquad a,b,c\\in A.$$ Furthermore, the\nassumption that scalars can be passed in and out of the bilinear product\ntranslates to $$(la)b=l(ab)=a(lb),\\qquad a,b\\in A, l\\in K.$$\n\nPerhaps the most important outcome of these two axioms of an algebra is\nthe opportunity to express polynomial like equations over the algebra.\nWithout the distributive axiom we cannot establish connections between\naddition and multiplication. Without scalar multiplication we cannot\ndescribe coefficients. With these equations we can define certain\nsubalgebras, for example we see both axioms at work in\n\nGiven an algebra $A$, the set $$Z_0(A)=\\{z\\in A: za=az, a\\in A\\}.$$\n$Z_0(A)$ is a submodule of $A$.\n\nFor now let elements of $A$ be denoted with $\\hat{a}$ to distinguish\nthem from scalars. As a module $0\\hat{a}=\\hat{0}$ for all $a\\in A$. Then\n$$\\hat{0}\\hat{a}=(0\\hat{a})\\hat{a}=(\\hat{a})(0\\hat{a})=\\hat{a}\\hat{0}.$$\nSo $\\hat{0}\\in Z_0(A)$.\n\nAlso given $\\hat{z},\\hat{w}\\in Z_0(A)$ then for all $a\\in A$,\n$$(\\hat{z}+\\hat{w})\\hat{a}=\\hat{z}\\hat{a}+\\hat{w}\\hat{a}\n    =\\hat{a}\\hat{z}+\\hat{a}\\hat{w}=\\hat{a}(\\hat{z}+\\hat{w}).$$ So\n$\\hat{z}+\\hat{w}\\in A$.\n\nFinally, given $l\\in K$ we have\n$$(l\\hat{z})\\hat{a}=l(\\hat{z}\\hat{a})=l(\\hat{a}\\hat{z})=\\hat{a}(l\\hat{z}).$$\n\nAlthough this set $Z(A)$ appears like a reasonable object to define as\nthe center of an algebra, it is usually preferable to produce a\nsubalgebra, not simply a submodule, and for this we need elements that\ncan be regrouped in products associatively, that is, that lie in the\nnucleus. So the center is commonly defined as\n$$Z(A)=\\{z\\in A: za=az, z(ab)=(za)b, a(zb)=(az)b, (ab)z=a(bz), a,b\\in A\\}.$$\n\nWhen the algebra $A$ has an identity (unity) $1$ then we can go further\nto identify $K$ as a subalgebra of $A$ by $l1$. Then we see this\nsubalgebra is necessarily in the center of $A$. As a converse, given a\nunital ring $R$ (associativity is necessary), the center of the ring\nforms a commutative unital subring over which $R$ is an algebra. In this\nway unital rings and associative unital algebras are often interchanged.",
