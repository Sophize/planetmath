  "definition": "Let $G={\\mathrm{GL}_{n} {\\mathbb{C}}}$, the group of all automorphisms\nof the $n$-dimensional vector space over the field of complex numbers\n$\\mathbb{C}$, and $H\\le G$ a subgroup of $G$. The *standard Borel\nsubgroup* of $H$ is the subgroup of $H$ consisting of all upper\ntriangular matrices (in $H$). A *Borel subgroup* of $H$ is a conjugate\n(in $H$) of the standard Borel subgroup of $H$.\n\nThe notion of a Borel subgroup can be generalized. Let $G$ be a complex\nsemi-simple Lie group. Then any maximal solvable subgroup $B\\leq G$ is\ncalled a Borel subgroup. All Borel subgroups of a given group are\nconjugate. Any Borel group is connected and equal to its own normalizer,\nand contains a unique Cartan subgroup. The intersection of $B$ with a\nmaximal compact subgroup $K$ of $G$ is the maximal torus of $K$.",
