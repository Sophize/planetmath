  "definition": "A non-associative algebra $A$ is *alternative* if\n\n1.  (left alternative laws) $[\\ a,a,b\\ ]=0$, and\n\n2.  (right alternative laws) $[\\ b,a,a\\ ]=0$,\n\nfor any $a,b\\in A$, where $[\\ , , ]$ is the associator on $A$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   Let $A$ be alternative and suppose $\\operatorname{char}(A)\\neq2$.\n    From the fact that $[\\ a+b,a+b,c\\ ]=0$, we can deduce that the\n    associator $[\\ , , ]$ is *anti-commutative*, when one of the three\n    coordinates is held fixed. That is, for any $a,b,c\\in A$,\n\n    1.  $[\\ a,b,c\\ ]=-[\\ b,a,c\\ ]$\n\n    2.  $[\\ a,b,c\\ ]=-[\\ a,c,b\\ ]$\n\n    3.  $[\\ a,b,c\\ ]=-[\\ c,b,a\\ ]$\n\n    Put more succinctly,\n    $$[\\ a_1,a_2,a_3\\ ]=\\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)[\\ a_{\\pi(1)},a_{\\pi(2)},a_{\\pi(3)}\\ ],$$\n    where $\\pi\\in S_3$, the symmetric group on three letters, and\n    $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)$ is the of $\\pi$.\n\n-   An alternative algebra is a flexible algebra, provided that the\n    algebra is not ( $\\neq2$). To see this, replace $c$ in the first\n    anti-commutative identities above with $a$ and the result follows.\n\n-   **Artin\u2019s Theorem**: If a non-associative algebra $A$ is not\n    Boolean, then $A$ is alternative iff every subalgebra of $A$\n    generated by two elements is associative. The proof is clear from\n    the above discussion.\n\n-   A commutative alternative algebra $A$ is a Jordan algebra. This is\n    true since $a^2(ba)=a^2(ab)=(ab)a^2=((ab)a)a=(a(ab))a=(a^2b)a$ shows\n    that the Jordan identity is satisfied.\n\n-   Alternativity can be defined for a general ring $R$: it is a\n    non-associative ring such that for any $a,b\\in R$, $(aa)b=a(ab)$ and\n    $(ab)b=a(bb)$. Equivalently, an alternative ring is an alternative\n    algebra over $\\mathbb{Z}$.",
