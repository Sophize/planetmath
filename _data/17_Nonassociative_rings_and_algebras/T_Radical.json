  "definition": "Let ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ be a Lie algebra. Since the sum of any two solvable\nideals of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ is in turn solvable, there is a unique\nmaximal solvable ideal of any Lie algebra. This ideal is called the\nradical of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. Note that\n${\\mathfrak{g}}/\\mathrm{rad}\\,{\\mathfrak{g}}$ has no solvable ideals,\nand is thus semi-simple. Thus, every Lie algebra is an of a semi-simple\nalgebra by a solvable one.",
