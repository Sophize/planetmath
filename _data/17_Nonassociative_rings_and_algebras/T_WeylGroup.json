  "definition": "The Weyl group $W_R$ of a root system $R\\subset E$, where $E$ is a\nEuclidean vector space, is the subgroup of $\\mathrm{GL}(E)$ generated by\nreflection in the hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. The map of\nreflection in a root $\\alpha$ is given by\n$$r_{\\alpha}(v)=v-2\\frac{(\\alpha,v)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\alpha.$$\n\nThe Weyl group is generated by reflections in the simple roots for any\nchoice of a set of positive roots. There is a well-defined length\nfunction $\\ell:W_R\\to\\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\ell(w)$ is the minimal number\nof reflections in simple roots that $w$ can be written as. This is also\nthe number of positive roots that $w$ takes to negative roots.",
