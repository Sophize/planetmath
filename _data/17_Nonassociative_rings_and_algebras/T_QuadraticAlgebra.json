  "definition": "A non-associative algebra $A$ (with unity $1_A$) over a commutative ring\n$R$ (with unity $1_R$) is called a *quadratic algebra* if $A$ admits a\nquadratic form $Q\\colon A\\to R$ such that\n\n1.  $Q(1_A)=1_R$,\n\n2.  the quadratic equation $x^2-b(1_A,x)x+Q(x)1_A=0$ is satisfied by all\n    $x\\in A$, where $b$ is the associated symmetric bilinear form given\n    by $b(x,y):=Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y)$.",
