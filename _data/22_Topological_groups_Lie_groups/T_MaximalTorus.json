  "definition": "Let $K$ be a compact group, and let $t\\in K$ be an element whose\ncentralizer has minimal dimension (such elements are dense in $K$). Let\n$T$ be the centralizer of $t$. This subgroup is closed since\n$T={\\varphi}^{-1}(t)$ where ${\\varphi}:K\\to K$ is the map\n$k\\mapsto ktk^{-1}$, and abelian since it is the intersection of $K$\nwith the Cartan subgroup of its complexification, and hence a torus,\nsince $K$ (and thus $T$) is compact. We call $T$ a [*maximal torus*]{}\nof $K$.\n\nThis term is also applied to the corresponding maximal abelian subgroup\nof a complex semisimple group, which is an algebraic torus.",
