If $U$ is any open neighborhood of $e$, then $G$ is\ngenerated by $U$.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[***Proof:***]{} Let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $e$. For each\n$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we denote by $U^n$ the set of elements of the form\n$u_1 \\dots u_n$, where each $u_i \\in U$. Let\n$W := \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} U^n$.\n\nSince each $U^n$ is open (see - 3), we have that $W$ is an open set. We\nnow see that it is also closed.\n\nLet $g \\in \\overline{W}$, the closure of $W$. Since $gU^{-1}$ is an open\nneighborhood of $g$, it must intersect $W$. Thus, let\n$h \\in W \\cap gU^{-1}$.\n\n-   Since $h \\in gU^{-1}$, then $h = gu^{-1}$ for some element\n    $u \\in U$.\n\n-   Since $h \\in W$, then $h \\in U^n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, i.e.\n    $h=u_1 \\dots u_n$ with each $u_i \\in U$.\n\nWe then have $g= u_1 \\dots u_n u$, i.e. $g \\in U^{n+1} \\subseteq W$.\nHence, $W$ is closed.\n\nSince $G$ is connected and $W$ is open and closed, we must have $W = G$.\nThis means that $G$ is generated by $U$. $\\square$",
