  "definition": "Let $G$ be a real Lie group. Then the [*complexification*]{}\n$G_{\\mathbb{C}}$ of $G$ is the unique complex Lie group equipped with a\nmap ${\\varphi}:G\\to G_{\\mathbb{C}}$ such that any map $G\\to H$ where $H$\nis a complex Lie group, extends to a holomorphic map\n$G_{\\mathbb{C}}\\to H$. If ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ and\n${\\mathfrak{g}}_{\\mathbb{C}}$ are the respective Lie algebras,\n${\\mathfrak{g}}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\cong{\\mathfrak{g}}\\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}}{\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\nFor simply connected groups, the construction is obvious: we simply take\nthe simply connected complex group with Lie algebra\n${\\mathfrak{g}}_{\\mathbb{C}}$, and ${\\varphi}$ to be the map induced by\nthe inclusion ${\\mathfrak{g}}\\to{\\mathfrak{g}}_{\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\nIf $\\gamma\\in G$ is central, then its image is in central in\n$G_{\\mathbb{C}}$ since $g\\mapsto \\gamma g\\gamma^{-1}$ is a map extending\n${\\varphi}$, and thus must be the identity by uniqueness half of the\nuniversal property. Thus, if $\\Gamma\\subset G$ is a discrete central\nsubgroup, then we get a map\n$G/\\Gamma\\to G_{\\mathbb{C}}/{\\varphi}(\\Gamma)$, which gives a\ncomplexification for $G/\\Gamma$. Since every Lie group is of this form,\nthis shows existence.\n\nSome easy examples: the complexification both of\n${\\mathrm{SL}_{n} {\\mathbb{R}}}$ and ${\\mathrm{SU}( n)}$ is\n${\\mathrm{SL}_{n} {\\mathbb{C}}}$. The complexification of ${\\mathbb{R}}$\nis ${\\mathbb{C}}$ and of $S^1$ is ${\\mathbb{C}}^*$.\n\nThe map ${\\varphi}\\colon G\\to G_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is not always injective.\nFor example, if $G$ is the universal cover of\n${\\mathrm{SL}_{n} {\\mathbb{R}}}$ (which has fundamental group\n${\\mathbb{Z}}$), then\n$G_{\\mathbb{C}}\\cong{\\mathrm{SL}_{n} {\\mathbb{C}}}$, and ${\\varphi}$\nfactors through the covering $G\\to {\\mathrm{SL}_{n} {\\mathbb{R}}}$.",
