We know that $Z$ is a\nnormal subgroup of $G$. Let us see that it is closed.\n\nLet $s \\in \\overline{Z}$, the closure of $Z$. There exists a net\n$\\{s_{\\lambda}\\}$ in $Z$ converging to $s$. Then, for every $g \\in G$,\nwe have that\n\n-   $gs_{\\lambda} \\longrightarrow gs$\n\n-   $s_{\\lambda}g \\longrightarrow sg$\n\nBut since $Z$ is the center of $G$ we have that\n$gs_{\\lambda} = s_{\\lambda}g$, and as $G$ is Hausdorff one must have\n$sg=gs$. This implies that $s \\in Z$, i.e. $Z$ is closed. $\\square$",
