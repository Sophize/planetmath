  "statement": "Any orthogonal matrix $O$ which does not have $-1$ as an eigenvalue can\nbe expressed as $$O = (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ for some suitable\nskew-symmetric matrix $A$. Conversely, any skew-symmetric matrix $A$ can\nbe expressed in terms of a suitable orthogonal matrix $O$ by a similar\nformula, $$A = (O + I)^{-1} (O - I).$$ These two formulae are each\nother\u2019s inverses and set up a one-to-one correspondence between\northogonal and skew-symmetric matrices.\n\n### Proof\n\nThe restriction on the eigenvalues of $O$ is necessary in order for\n$I + O$ to be invertible.\n\nIt is a matter of simple computation why these formulae are correct.\nSuppose that $A$ is skew-symmetric. Then\n$$O^T O = \\left( (I + A) (I - A)^{-1} \\right)^T (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$\nUsing the fact that the transpose of a product is the product of the\ntransposes in the opposite order,\n$$= ((I - A)^{-1})^T (I + A)^T (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ Using the fact\nthat the transpose of a sum is the sum of transposes and the transpose\nof an inverse is the inverse of the transpose,\n$$= (I^T - A^T)^{-1} (I^T + A^T) (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ By the\ndefinition of skew-symmetry, $A^T = -A$ and $I^T = I$,\n$$= (I + A)^{-1} (I - A) (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ Finally, since $I + A$\nand $I - A$ commute, we may switch the order of the second and third\nfactors: $$= (I + A)^{-1} (I + A) (I - A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ Then the first\ntwo factors and the last two factors cancel, showing that $O^T O = I$.\n\nNext, we verify that the second formula is indeed the inverse of the\nfirst formula. Multiplying by $I - A$ on both sides,\n$$O (I - A) = I + A$$ Expanding this and moving terms from one side of\nthe equation to the other, $$O - I = A + OA$$ Factoring,\n$$O - I = (I + O) A$$ Multiplying both sides by $(I + O)^{-1}$, we\nobtain the desired formula: $$(O + I)^{-1} (O - I) = A$$\n\nFinally, one can show that, if $O$ is orthogonal, then $A$ is\nskew-symmetric using the same sort of computation that was used to show\nthe converse: $$A^T = \\left( (O + I)^{-1} (O - I) \\right)^T$$ Using the\nfacts about transposes of sums, products, and inverses,\n$$= (O^T - I^T) (O^T + I^T)^{-1}$$ Since $O$ is orthogonal,\n$O^T = O^{-1}$. As usual $I^T = I$. $$= (O^{-1} - I) (O^{-1} + I)^{-1}$$\nInsert an identity matrix between the two factors like so:\n$$= (O^{-1} - I) I (O^{-1} + I)^{-1}$$ Replace the identity matrix with\n$O O^{-1}$: $$= (O^{-1} - I) O O^{-1} (O^{-1} + I)^{-1}$$ Absorbing the\n$O$ and the $O^{-1}$ into the factors,\n$$= (I - O) (I + O)^{-1} = - (O - I ) (O + I)^{-1}.$$ Since\n$$O(O+I)^{-1}=((O+I)O^T)^{-1}=(I+O^T)^{-1}=(O^T(O+I))^{-1}=(O+I)^{-1}O,$$\n$(O-I)$ and $(O+I)^{-1}$ commute, and consequently\n$$= - (O+I)^{-1}(O-I)= - A.$$\n\n### Cayley Transform\n\nThe relation between $A$ and $O$ which is set up by the formulas\n$$O = (I + A) (I - A)^{-1}$$ and $$A = (O + I)^{-1} (O - I)$$ is\nsometimes known as the *Cayley transform*. Note that the proof that\nthese two formulas are each other\u2019s inverses did not require $A$ to be\nskew-symmetric or $O$ to be orthogonal. Hence, the Cayley transform is\ndefined for all matrices such that $-1$ is not an eigenvalue of $O$.\n(Recall that this condition is necessary to insure that $O + I$ is\ninvertible.\n\n### Generalizations\n\nThe Cayley parameterization can be generalized to unitary transforms.\nNamely, if $U$ is a unitary matrix, then $U$ is the Cayley transform of\na skew-Hermitean matrix $A$. Since a skew-Hermitean matrix can be\nwritten as $i$ times a Hermitean matrix, the Cayley transform is often\nwritten as follows when dealing with unitary matrices:\n$$U = (iI + H) (iI - H)^{-1}$$ $$iH = (U + I)^{-1} (U - I)$$ where $H$\nis Hermitean. The proof in this case is substantially the same as was\npresented above; all one has to do is replace matrix transposition with\nHermitean conjugation.\n\nA special case of this worth pointing out is the case of one-dimensional\nunitary matrices. The sole entry of a one dimensional unitary matrix\nmust have modulus 1 and the sole entry of a one-dimensional Hermitean\nmatrix must be real. In that case, the Cayley transform reduces to\n$$u = {i + h \\over i - h}$$ $$ih  = {u + i \\over u - i} ,$$ which is a\nfractional linear transform that maps the unit circle to the real axis.\n\nThe Cayley parameterization can be generalized to the case of a general\ninner product with arbitrary signature (see Sylvester\u2019s law for the\ndefinition of signature \u2014 Cayley and Sylvester were the best of\nfriends). We simply need to define the transpose of a matrix $M$ by the\ncondition $(M^T u) \\cdot v = u \\cdot (M v)$ for all vectors $u$ and $v$.\nIn particular, this allows one to parameterize pseudo-orthogonal\nmatrices such as Lorentz transformations using a Cayley\nparameterization. Likewise, given a conjugate linear inner product on a\ncomplex vector space, one has a Cayley parameterization of the unitary\n(or pseudo-unitary) transforms which preserve the product.\n\nIn conclusion, it might be worth pointing out that the Cayley transform\ngeneralizes to the case of infinite dimensions, if one replaces matrices\nwith operators on a Hilbert space. In particular, it is useful because\nunitary and orthogonal operators are bounded whereas Hermitean and\nskew-symmetric operators may or may not be bounded. For instance, it is\noften easier to obtain the spectral decomposition of a Hermitean\noperator or study symmetric extensions of a symmetric operator by first\nperforming a Cayley transform and dealing with the resulting bounded\noperator.",
