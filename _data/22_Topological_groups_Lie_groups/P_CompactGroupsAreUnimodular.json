It is enough to prove\nthat $\\Delta$ is constant and equal to $1$, since this proves that every\nleft Haar measure is right invariant.\n\nSince $\\Delta$ is continuous and $G$ is compact, $\\Delta(G)$ is a\ncompact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^+$. In particular, $\\Delta(G)$ is a\nbounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^+$.\n\nBut if $\\Delta$ is not identically one, then there is a $t \\in G$ such\nthat $\\Delta(t) >1$ (recall that $\\Delta$ is an homomorphism). Hence,\n$\\Delta(t^n) = \\Delta(t)^n \\longrightarrow \\infty$ as $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\nincreases, which is a contradiction since $\\Delta(G)$ is bounded.\n$\\square$",
