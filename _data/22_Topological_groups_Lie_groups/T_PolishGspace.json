  "definition": "Let $X$ be a , and $G$ its associated topological group, that is, such\nthat an action $a$ of $G$ on $X$ is continuous if $a : G \\times X \\to X$\nis continuous. If $G$ is a Polish group and $X$ is also a Polish space,\nthen $X$ is called a *Polish G-space*.\n\n[9]{} Howard Becker, Alexander S.
