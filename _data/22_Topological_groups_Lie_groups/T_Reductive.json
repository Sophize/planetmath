  "definition": "Let $G$ be a Lie group or algebraic group. $G$ is called [*reductive*]{}\nover a field $k$ if every representation of $G$ over $k$ is completely\nreducible\n\nFor example, a finite group is reductive over a field $k$ if and only if\nits order is not divisible by the characteristic of $k$ (by Maschke\u2019s\ntheorem). A complex Lie group is reductive if and only if it is a direct\nproduct of a semisimple group and an algebraic torus.",
