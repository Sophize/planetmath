  "definition": "Let $G$ be a Lie Group. A *one-parameter subgroup* of $G$ is a group\nhomomorphism $$\\phi\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to G$$ that is also a differentiable\nmap at the same time. We view $\\mathbb{R}$ additively and $G$\nmultiplicatively, so that $\\phi(r+s)=\\phi(r)\\phi(s)$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  If $G=\\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$, where $k=\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$,\n    then any one-parameter subgroup has the form $$\\phi(t)=e^{tA},$$\n    where $A=\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}(0)$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix over $k$. The\n    matrix $A$ is just a tangent vector to the Lie group\n    $\\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$. This property establishes the fact that\n    there is a one-to-one correspondence between one-parameter subgroups\n    and tangent vectors of $\\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$. The same\n    relationship holds for a general Lie group. The one-to-one\n    correspondence between tangent vectors at the identity (the Lie\n    algebra) and one-parameter subgroups is established via the\n    exponential map instead of the matrix exponential.\n\n2.  If\n    $G=\\operatorname{O}(n,\\mathbb{R})\\subseteq\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$,\n    the orthogonal group over $R$, then any one-parameter subgroup has\n    the same form as in the example above, except that $A$ is\n    skew-symmetric: $A^{\\operatorname{T}}=-A$.\n\n3.  If\n    $G=\\operatorname{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})\\subseteq\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$,\n    the special linear group over $R$, then any one-parameter subgroup\n    has the same form as in the example above, except that\n    $\\operatorname{tr}(A)=0$, where $\\operatorname{tr}$ is the trace\n    operator.\n\n4.  If\n    $G=\\operatorname{U}(n)=\\operatorname{O}(n,\\mathbb{C})\\subseteq\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\mathbb{C})$,\n    the unitary group over $C$, then any one-parameter subgroup has the\n    same form as in the example above, except that $A$ is :\n    $A=-A^{*}=-\\overline{A}^{\\operatorname{T}}$ and\n    $\\operatorname{tr}(A)=0$.",
