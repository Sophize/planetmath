  "statement": "Topological group $G$ is called *Alexandroff* if $G$ is an Alexandroff\nspace as a topological space. For example every finite topological group\nis Alexandroff. We wish to characterize them. First recall, that if $A$\nis a subset of a topological space, then $A^{o}$ denotes an intersection\nof all open neighbourhoods of $A$.\n\n**Lemma.** Let $X$ be an Alexandroff space,\n$f:X\\times\\cdots\\times X\\to X$ be a continuous map and $x\\in X$ such\nthat $f(x,\\ldots,x)=x$. Then $f(A\\times\\cdots\\times A)\\subseteq A$,\nwhere $A=\\{x\\}^{o}$.\n\n*Proof.* Let $A=\\{x\\}^{o}$. Of course $A$ is open (because $X$ is\nAlexandroff). Therefore $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $X\\times\\cdots\\times X$.\nThus (from the definition of product topology and continuous map), there\nare open subsetes $V_1,\\ldots, V_n\\subseteq X$ such that each $V_i$ is\nan open neighbourhood of $x$ and\n$$f(V_1\\times\\cdots\\times V_n)\\subseteq A.$$ Now let $U_i=V_i\\cap A$. Of\ncourse $x\\in U_i$, so $U_i$ is nonempty and $U_i$ is open. Furthermore\n$U_i\\subseteq V_i$ and thus $$f(U_1\\times\\cdots\\times U_n)\\subseteq A.$$\nOn the other hand $U_i\\subseteq A$ and $U_i$ is open neighbourhood of\n$x$. Thus $U_i=A$, because $A$ is minimal open neighbourhood of $x$.\nTherefore\n$$f(A\\times\\cdots\\times A)=f(U_1\\times\\cdots\\times U_n)\\subseteq A,$$\nwhich completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Proposition.** Let $G$ be an Alexandroff group. Then there exists\nopen, normal subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that for every open subset\n$U\\subseteq G$ there exist $\\{g_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}\\subseteq G$ such that\n$$U=\\bigcup_{i\\in I}\\, g_iH.$$\n\n*Proof.* Let $H=\\{e\\}^{o}$ be an intersection of all open neighbourhoods\nof the identity $e\\in G$. Let $U$ be an open subset of $G$. If $g\\in U$,\nthen $g^{-1}U$ is an open neighbourhood of $e$. Thus\n$H\\subseteq g^{-1}U$ and therefore $gH\\subseteq U$. Thus\n$$U=\\bigcup_{g\\in U}\\, gH.$$ To complete the proof we need to show that\n$H$ is normal subgroup of $G$. Consider the following mappings:\n$$M:G\\times G\\to G\\mbox{ is such that }M(x,y)=xy;$$\n$$\\psi:G\\to G\\mbox{ is such that }\\psi(x)=x^{-1};$$\n$$\\varphi_{g}:G\\to G\\mbox{ is such that }\\varphi_{g}(x)=gxg^{-1}\\mbox{ for any }g\\in G.$$\nOf course each of them is continuous (because $G$ is a topological\ngroup). Furthermore each of them satisfies Lemma\u2019s assumptions (for\n$x=e$). Thus we have: $$HH=M(H\\times H)\\subseteq H;$$\n$$H^{-1}=\\psi(H)\\subseteq H;$$\n$$gHg^{-1}=\\varphi_{g}(H)\\subseteq H\\mbox{ for any }g\\in G.$$ This shows\nthat $H$ is a normal subgroup, which completes the proof. $\\square$\n\n**Corollary.** Let $G$ be a topological group such that $G$ is finite\nand simple. Then $G$ is either discrete or antidiscrete.\n\n*Proof.* Of course finite topological groups are Alexandroff. Since $G$\nis simple, then there are only two normal subgroups of $G$, namely the\ntrivial group and entire $G$. Therfore (due to proposition) the topology\non $G$ is ,,generated\u201d by either the trivial group or entire $G$. In the\nfirst case we gain the discrete topology and in the second the\nantidiscrete topology. $\\square$",
