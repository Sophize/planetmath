  "definition": "A ring $A$ is said to be a *normed ring* if $A$ possesses a norm\n$\\| \\cdot \\|$, that is, a non-negative real-valued function\n$\\|\\cdot \\|:A\\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that for any $a,b\\in A$,\n\n1.  $\\|a\\|=0$ iff $a=0$,\n\n2.  $\\|a+b\\|\\le \\|a\\|+\\|b\\|$,\n\n3.  $\\|-a\\|=\\|a\\|$, and\n\n4.  $\\|ab\\|\\le \\|a\\|\\|b\\|$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   If $A$ contains the multiplicative identity $1$, then\n    $0<\\|1\\| \\le\\|1\\|\\|1\\|$ and so $1\\le \\|1\\|$.\n\n-   However, it is usually required that in a normed ring, $\\|1\\|=1$.\n\n-   $\\|\\cdot\\|$ defines a metric $d$ on $A$ given by $d(a,b)=\\|a-b\\|$,\n    so that $A$ with $d$ is a metric space and one can set up a topology\n    on $A$ by defining its subbasis a collection of\n    $B(a,r):=\\lbrace x\\in A\\mid d(a,x)< r\\rbrace$ called *open balls*\n    for any $a\\in A$ and $r>0$. With this definition, it is easy to see\n    that $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is continuous.\n\n-   Given a sequence $\\lbrace a_n\\rbrace$ of elements in $A$, we say\n    that $a$ is a limit point of $\\lbrace a_n\\rbrace$, if\n    $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\|a_n-a\\|=0.$$ By the triangle inequality, $a$,\n    if it exists, is unique, and so we also write\n    $$a=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n.$$\n\n-   In addition, the last condition ensures that the ring multiplication\n    is continuous.\n\nAn algebra $A$ over a field $k$ is said to be a *normed algebra* if\n\n1.  $A$ is a normed ring with norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$,\n\n2.  $k$ is equipped with a valuation $| \\cdot |$, and\n\n3.  $\\|\\alpha a\\|=|\\alpha|\\|a\\|$ for any $\\alpha \\in k$ and $a\\in A$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Alternatively, a normed algebra $A$ can be defined as a normed\n    vector space with a multiplication defined on $A$ such that\n    multiplication is continuous with respect to the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$.\n\n-   Typically, $k$ is either the reals $\\mathbb{R}$ or the complex\n    numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, and $A$ is called a *real normed algebra* or a\n    *complex normed algebra* correspondingly.\n\n-   A normed algebra that is complete with respect to the norm is called\n    Banach algebra (the underlying field must be complete and\n    algebraically closed), paralleling with the analogy with a Banach\n    space versus a normed vector space.\n\n-   Normed rings and normed algebras are special cases of the more\n    general notions of a topological ring and a *topological algebra*,\n    the latter of which is defined as a topological ring over a field\n    such that the scalar multiplication is continuous.\n\n[7]{} M.
