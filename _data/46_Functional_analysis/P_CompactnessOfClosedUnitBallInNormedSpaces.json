Then $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ is\ncompact if and only if $X$ is .\n\nThe above result is false, in general, if one is considering other\ntopologies in $X$ besides the norm topology (see, for example, the\nBanach-Alaoglu theorem). It follows that normed spaces are not locally\ncompact.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[***Proof:***]{}\n\n-   $(\\Longleftarrow)$ This is the easy part. Since $X$ is finite\n    dimensional it is isomorphic to some $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (with the\n    standard topology). The result then follows from the Heine-Borel\n    theorem.\n\n    $\\,$\n\n-   $(\\Longrightarrow)$ Suppose that $X$ is not finite dimensional. Pick\n    an element $x_1 \\in X$ such that $\\|x_1\\|=1$ and denote by $S_1$ the\n    generated by $x_1.$\n\n    Recall that, according to the , there exists an element $x_2 \\in X$\n    such that $\\|x_2\\|=1$ and $d(x_2,S_1)\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, where\n    $d(y, M):= \\inf\\{\\|y-z\\|: z\\in M\\}$ denotes the distance between an\n    element $y\\in X$ and a subspace $M\\subset X.$\n\n    Now consider the subspace $S_2$ generated by $x_1, x_2$. Since $X$\n    is infinite dimensional $S_2$ is a proper subspace and we can still\n    apply the Riesz Lemma to find an element $x_3$ such that $\\|x_3\\|=1$\n    and $d(x_3,S_2)\\geq \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\n    If we proceed inductively, we will find a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ of norm\n    1 elements and a sequence of subspaces\n    $S_n:=\\langle x_1, \\dots, x_n\\rangle$ such that\n    $d(x_{n+1}, S_n)\\geq\\frac{1}{2}.$ Under this setting it is easily\n    seen that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is in $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ and\n    satisfies $\\|x_n - x_m\\|\\geq\\frac{1}{2}$ for all\n    $m \\neq n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, $\\{x_n\\}$ is a sequence in\n    $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ that has no subsequence, i.e.,\n    $\\overline{B_1(0)}$ is not compact. $\\square$\n\n$\\,$\n\n[**Remarks on the proof -**]{} Note that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$\nconstructed in the proof does not have a . Thus we have in fact proven\nthe slightly stronger result that $X$ is finite dimensional if and only\nif every bounded sequence in $X$ has a Cauchy subsequence.\n\nFor Hilbert spaces the proof would be slightly simpler because one could\njust pick any orthonormal basis $\\{e_n\\},$ and it would\n$\\|e_n - e_m\\| = \\sqrt{2}$ for all $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $m\\neq n,$\ntherefore having no convergent subsequence. For general normed spaces we\ncannot just pick orthonormal elements, since this notion does not exist.\nThus, we have to use Riesz Lemma to assure the existence of elements\nwith some .",
