  "definition": "Let $X$ be a measure space with measure $\\mu$. To each point $x \\in X$,\nassign a Hilbert space $H(x)$. Then the *direct integral* of this family\nof Hilbert spaces indexed by the points of a measure space, denoted\n$$\\int_{\\oplus X} H(x) \\, d\\mu(x)$$ is the set of all functions\n$v \\colon X \\to \\bigcup_{x \\in X} H(x)$ (as usual in functional\nanalysis, we regard two functions that disagree on a set of measure zero\nas the same) such that\n\n-   $v(x) \\in H(x)$\n\n-   $\\| v(x) \\| \\in L^2 (X,\\mu)$\n\nVector addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise:\n$(u + v) (x) = u(x) + v(x)$ and $(sv) (x) = s v(x)$. The inner product\nis defined as\n$$\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\int_X \\langle u(x), v(x) \\rangle \\, dx \\qquad.$$\n\nA nice illustration of the direct integral is the expression of\n$L^2 (\\mathbb{R}^2)$ as a direct integral of a continuous infinity of\ncopies of $L^2 (\\mathbb{R})$. Let the space $H(k)$ consists of all\nfunctions of the form $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mapsto e^{ikx} g(y)$ such\nthat $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} |g(y)|^2 < \\infty$. Define the inner\nproduct of two functions $e^{ikx} g_1(y) \\in H(k)$ and\n$e^{ikx} g_2(y) \\in H(k)$ as $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} g_1 (y) g_2 (y)$.\n(By the way, note that $H(k)$ is not a subset of $L^2 (\\mathbb{R}^2)$\nbecause the functions contained in $H(k)$ are not square-integrable in\nthe $x$ variable.)\n\nBy the definition, the space\n$\\int_{\\oplus -\\infty}^{+\\infty} H(k) \\, dk$ consists of functions\n$(k,x,y) \\mapsto e^{ikx} g(k,y)$ such that\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\|g(k)\\|_{H(k)} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} |g(k,y)|^2 \\,dy \\,dk < \\infty$$\nElements of this space may be regarded as functions of $x$ and $y$ in a\nnatural way: $$\\tilde g(x,y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} e^{ikx} g(k,y)$$\nBy Parseval\u2019s identity, $\\tilde g \\in L^2 (\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n\nThe reason for choosing this example is that it illustrates two\nsituations in which direct integrals are usually encountered. First,\ndirect integrals can be used to provide an analogue of the decomposition\nof a vector space as a direct sum of eigenspaces of a matrix for\noperators with continuous spectra. The space $H(k)$ in the example can\nbe regarded as the \u201ceigenspace\u201d of the formally self-adjoint operator\n$-i \\partial / \\partial x$ with eigenvalue $k$. (It is not eigenspaces\nin the strict sense of the term since its elements are not square\nintegrable in $x$.) The spectrum of this operator is the whole real axis\nand the direct integral of these \u201ceigenspaces\u201d is the whole vector space\non which the operator acts.\n\nA second situation which can be illustrated with this example is the use\nof direct integrals in group representation theory. Consider the group\nof translations along the $x$ axis. Each of the spaces $H(k)$ transforms\nunder a different representation of this group \u2014 under translation by an\namount $x_0$ along the $x$ axis, an element of $H(k)$ is multiplied by a\nfactor $e^{i k x_0}$. The direct integral is the infinite-dimensional\nanalogue of the decomposition of a finite-dimensional vector space on\nwhich a group acts as a direct sum of irreducible representations.",
