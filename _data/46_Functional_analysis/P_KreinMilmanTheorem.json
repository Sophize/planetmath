  "statement": "Let $X$ be a locally convex topological vector space, and let\n$K \\subset X$ be a compact . Then $K$ is the closed convex hull of its\nextreme points.\n\nThe closed convex hull above is defined as the intersection of all\nclosed convex subsets of $X$ that contain $K$. This turns out to be the\nsame as the closure of the convex hull in a topological vector space.\n\n[9]{} H. L. Royden. **. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey,\n1988",
