The set of all bounded functions on $X$ is\nusually denoted by $B(X)$ ([@aliprantis], pp. 61).\n\nUnder standard point-wise addition and point-wise multiplication by a\nscalar, $B(X)$ is a complex vector space.\n\nIf $f\\in B(X)$, then the *sup-norm*, or *uniform norm*, of $f$ is\ndefined as $$||f||_\\infty = \\sup_{x\\in X} |f(x)|.$$ It is\nstraightforward to check that $||\\cdot||_\\infty$ makes $B(X)$ into a\nnormed vector space, i.e., to check that $||\\cdot||_\\infty$ satisfies\nthe assumptions for a norm.\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose $X$ is a compact topological space. Further, let $C(X)$ be the\nset of continuous complex-valued functions on $X$ (with the same vector\nspace structure as $B(X)$). Then $C(X)$ is a vector subspace of $B(X)$.\n\n[9]{} C.D.
