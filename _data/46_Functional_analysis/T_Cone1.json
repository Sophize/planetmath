  "definition": "Suppose $V$ is a real (or complex) vector space with a subset $C$.\n\n1.  If $\\lambda C \\subset C$ for any real $\\lambda >0$, then $C$ is\n    called a [**cone**]{}.\n\n2.  If the origin belongs to a cone, then the cone is said to be\n    [**pointed**]{}. Otherwise, the cone is [**blunt**]{}.\n\n3.  A pointed cone is [**salient**]{}, if it contains no $1$-dimensional\n    vector subspace of $V$.\n\n4.  If $C-x_0$ is a cone for some $x_0$ in $V$, then $C$ is a [**cone\n    with vertex**]{} at $x_0$.\n\n5.  A convex pointed cone is called a [**wedge**]{}.\n\n6.  A [**proper cone**]{} is a convex cone $C$ with vertex at $0$, such\n    that $C\\cap (-C)=\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$. A slightly more specific\n    definition of a proper cone is this , but it requires the vector\n    space to be topological.\n\n7.  A cone $C$ is said to be [**generating**]{} if $V=C-C$. In this\n    case, $V$ is said to be [**generated by**]{} $C$.\n\n### Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n\n1.  In ${\\mathbb{R}}$, the set $x>0$ is a blunt cone.\n\n2.  In ${\\mathbb{R}}$, the set $x\\ge 0$ is a pointed salient cone.\n\n3.  Suppose $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Then for any $\\varepsilon>0$, the set\n    $$C=\\bigcup \\{\\, \\lambda B_x(\\varepsilon) \\mid \\lambda >0 \\,\\}$$ is\n    an open cone. If $|x| < \\varepsilon$, then $C={\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Here,\n    $B_x(\\varepsilon)$ is the open ball at $x$ with radius\n    $\\varepsilon$.\n\n4.  In a normed vector space, a blunt cone $C$ is completely determined\n    by the intersection of $C$ with the unit sphere.\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n1.  The union and intersection of a collection of cones is a cone. In\n    other words, the set of cones forms a complete lattice.\n\n2.  The complement of a cone is a cone. This means that the complete\n    lattice of cones is also a complemented lattice.\n\n3.  A cone $C$ is convex iff $C+C\\subseteq C$.\n\n    If $C$ is convex and $a,b\\in C$, then\n    $\\frac{1}{2}a,\\frac{1}{2}b\\in C$, so their sum, being the convex\n    combination of $a,b$, is in $C$, and therefore\n    $a+b=2(\\frac{1}{2}a+\\frac{1}{2}b)\\in C$ also. Conversely, suppose a\n    cone $C$ satisfies $C+C\\subseteq C$, and $a,b\\in C$. Then\n    $\\lambda a,(1-\\lambda)b\\in C$ for $\\lambda> 0$ (the case when\n    $\\lambda=0$ is obvious). Therefore their sum is also in $C$.\n\n4.  A cone containing $0$ is a cone with vertex at $0$. As a result, a\n    wedge is a cone with vertex at $0$.\n\n5.  The only cones that are subspaces at the same time are wedges.\n\n[9]{} M. Reed, B.
