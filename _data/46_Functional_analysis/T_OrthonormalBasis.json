The second\ncondition says that every element of $V$ can be approximated arbitrarily\nclosely by (finite) linear combinations of elements of $B$.\n\nOrthonormal bases of Hilbert spaces {#orthonormal-bases-of-hilbert-spaces .unnumbered}\n===================================\n\nEvery Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis. The cardinality of this\northonormal basis is called the *dimension* of the Hilbert space. (This\nis well-defined, as the cardinality does not depend on the choice of\northonormal basis. This dimension is not in general the same as .)\n\nIf $B$ is an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space $H$, then for every\n$x\\in H$ we have $$x=\\sum_{b\\in B}\\ip{x,b}b.$$ Thus $x$ is expressed as\na (possibly infinite) \u201clinear combination\u201d of elements of $B$. The\nexpression is well-defined, because only countably many of the terms\n$\\ip{x,b}b$ are non-zero (even if $B$ itself is uncountable), and if\nthere are infinitely many non-zero terms the series is unconditionally\nconvergent. For any $x,y\\in H$ we also have\n$$\\ip{x,y}=\\sum_{b\\in B}\\ip{x,b}\\ip{b,y}.$$",
