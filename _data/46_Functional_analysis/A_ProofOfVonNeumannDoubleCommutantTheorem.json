  "argumentText": "[**Lemma -**]{} Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $B(H)$ its algebra of\nbounded operators. Let $\\mathcal{N}$ be a \\*-subalgebra of $B(H)$ that\ncontains the identity operator and is closed in the strong operator\ntopology. If $T \\in \\mathcal{N}''$, the double commutant of\n$\\mathcal{N}$, then for each $x \\in H$ there is an operator\n$A \\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that $\\|(A-T)x\\| < 1$.\n\n[***:***]{} Let $\\overline{\\mathcal{N}x} \\subseteq H$ be the closure of\nthe subspace $\\mathcal{N}x := \\{Sx: S \\in \\mathcal{N}\\}$. It is clear\nthat $\\mathcal{N}x$ is an invariant subspace for $\\mathcal{N}$, hence so\nis its closure $\\overline{\\mathcal{N}x}$ (see , Proposition 5).\n\nLet $P$ be the orthogonal projection onto $\\overline{\\mathcal{N}x}$.\nSince $\\overline{\\mathcal{N}x}$ is invariant for $\\mathcal{N}$, we have\nthat $P \\in \\mathcal{N}'$ (see , last theorem). Since $\\mathcal{N}$\ncontains the identity operator, we know that $x$ belongs to\n$\\overline{\\mathcal{N}x}$. Hence,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nTx = TPx = PTx\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere the last equality comes from the fact that $T \\in \\mathcal{N}''$\nand $P \\in \\mathcal{N}'$. Thus, we see that\n$Tx \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{N}x}$, which implies that there exists an\n$A \\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that $\\|Tx - Ax\\| < 1$. $\\square$\n\n$\\,$\n\n[****]{} $(1) \\Longrightarrow (2)$ Since $\\mathcal{M}''$ is the\ncommutant of some set, namely it is the commutant of $\\mathcal{M}'$, it\nfollows that $\\mathcal{M}''$ is closed in the weak operator topology\n(see ). But we are assuming that $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{M}''$, hence\n$\\mathcal{M}$ is closed in the weak operator topology.\n\n$(2) \\Longrightarrow (3)$ This part is obvious since the weak operator\ntopology is weaker than the strong operator topology.\n\n$(3) \\Longrightarrow (1)$ Suppose $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed in the strong\noperator topology.\n\nA subset of $B(H)$ is always contained in its double commutant, thus\n$\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}''$. So it remains to prove the\nopposite inclusion.\n\nLet $T \\in \\mathcal{M}''$. We are going to prove that $T$ belongs to the\nstrong operator closure of $\\mathcal{M}$, and since $\\mathcal{M}$ is\nclosed under this topology, it will follow that $T \\in \\mathcal{M}$.\n\nRecall that the strong operator topology is the topology in $B(H)$\ngenerated by the family of seminorms $\\| \\cdot \\|_x, x \\in H$ defined by\n$\\|S\\|_x:=\\|Sx\\|$. A local base around $T$, in this topology, consists\nof sets of the form\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nV(x_1, \\dots, x_n;\\, \\epsilon):= \\{S \\in B(H) : \\|(S - T)x_i\\| \\leq \\epsilon, i=1, \\dots, n\\}\\,, \\qquad\\qquad x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in H, \\epsilon >0\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe can however consider $\\epsilon$ to be $1$, since\n$V(x_1, \\dots, x_n;\\, \\epsilon)= V(\\epsilon^{-1}x_1, \\dots, \\epsilon^{-1} x_n; 1)$.\n\nFor every $x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in H$ we want to find $A \\in \\mathcal{M}$\nsuch that $A \\in V(x_1, \\dots, x_n;\\, 1)$, i.e. such that\n$\\|(A - T)x_i\\| < 1$, for each $i$.\n\nLet $\\widetilde{H}$ be the direct sum of Hilbert spaces\n$\\widetilde{H}:= \\oplus_{i = 1}^n H$. For every $A \\in B(H)$ let\n$\\widetilde{A} \\in B(\\widetilde{H})$ be the\n$\\widetilde{A}:= \\oplus_{i=1}^n A$, i.e.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{A} (y_1, \\dots, y_n) = (Ay_1, \\dots, Ay_n)\\,, \\qquad\\qquad y_1, \\dots, y_n \\in H\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe have that $\\mathcal{N}:= \\{\\widetilde{A}: A \\in \\mathcal{M}\\}$ is a\n\\*-algebra of bounded operators in $\\widetilde{H}$.\n\n[**Claim 1 -**]{} $\\widetilde{T} \\in \\mathcal{N}''$.\n\nThe algebra $B(\\widetilde{H})$ can be canonically identified with the\nalgebra of $n \\times n$ matrices with entries in $B(H)$, and\n$\\mathcal{N}$ corresponds to the diagonal matrices with an element\n$A \\in \\mathcal{M}$ in the diagonal. Thus, it is easy to check that\n$\\mathcal{N}'$ is precisely the set of matrices whose entries belong to\n$\\mathcal{M}'$.\n\nSince the belong to $\\mathcal{N}'$, it follows that $\\mathcal{N}''$\nconsists solely of diagonal matrices with one element on the diagonal\n(see ). It is easy to check that $\\mathcal{N}''$ is precisely the set of\ndiagonal matrices with one element of $\\mathcal{M}''$ in the diagonal.\nHence, we conclude that $\\widetilde{T} \\in \\mathcal{N}''$, and Claim 1\nis proved.\n\nNow, we observe that $\\mathcal{N}$ is a \\*-subalgebra of\n$B(\\widetilde{H})$ that contains the identity operator. Since\n$\\mathcal{M}$ is closed in the strong operator topology, it follows\neasily that $\\mathcal{N}$ is also closed in the strong operator\ntopology. Since $\\widetilde{T} \\in \\mathcal{N}''$, Lemma 1 that for each\n$\\widetilde{x} := (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\widetilde{H}$ there exists an\noperator $\\widetilde{A} \\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that\n$\\|(\\widetilde{A}- \\widetilde{T})\\widetilde{x}\\| < 1$. But this is\nimplies that $\\|(A-T)x_i\\| < 1$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nThus, $T \\in V(x_1, \\dots, x_n;\\, 1)$. Hence we conclude that $T$\nbelongs to the operator closure of $\\mathcal{M}$, but since\n$\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under this topology, $T \\in \\mathcal{M}$.\n\nWe conclude that $\\mathcal{M}'' = \\mathcal{M}$. $\\square$",
