  "definition": "Let $\\Vert x\\Vert$ and $\\Vert x\\Vert' $ be two norms on a vector space\n$V$. These norms are *equivalent norms* if there exists a number $C>1$\nsuch that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{condC}\n \\frac{1}{C} \\Vert x\\Vert \\le \\Vert x\\Vert' \\le C \\Vert x\\Vert\\end{aligned}$$\nfor all $x\\in V$.\n\nSince equation is equivalent to $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{condC1}\n \\frac{1}{C} \\Vert x\\Vert ' \\le \\Vert x\\Vert \\le C \\Vert x\\Vert'\\end{aligned}$$\nit follows that the definition is well defined. In other words,\n$\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert$ and $\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert'$ are equivalent if and only if\n$\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert'$ and $\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert$ are equivalent. An\nalternative condition is that there exist positive real numbers $c,d$\nsuch that $$c\\Vert x\\Vert \\le \\Vert x \\Vert' \\le d \\Vert x\\Vert.$$\nHowever, this condition is equivalent to the above by setting\n$C=\\max\\{1/c,d\\}$.\n\nSome key results are as follows:\n\n1.  If $\\gamma>0$ and $\\Vert x \\Vert' = \\gamma \\Vert x \\Vert$, then\n    $\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert$ and $\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert'$ are equivalent. For\n    example, if $\\gamma>1$, then condition holds with $C=\\gamma$, and\n    for $\\gamma<1$, condition holds with $C=1/\\gamma$.\n\n2.  Suppose norms $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ and $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert'$ are\n    equivalent norms as in equation , and let $B_r(x)$ and $B_r'(x)$ be\n    the open balls with respect to $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ and\n    $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert'$, respectively. By it follows that\n    $$C B_{\\varepsilon}(x) \\subseteq B'_\\varepsilon(x)\\subseteq \\frac{1}{C} B_{\\varepsilon}(x).$$\n\n    It follows that the identity map from $(V,\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert)$ to\n    $(V,\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert')$ is a homeomorphism. Or, alternatively,\n    equivalent norms on $V$ induce the same topology on $V$.\n\n3.  The converse of the last paragraph is also true, i.e. if two norms\n    induce the same topology on $V$ then they are equivalent. This\n    follows from the fact that every continuous linear function between\n    two normed vector spaces is (see ).\n\n4.  Suppose $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ and $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle'$\n    are inner product. Suppose further that the induced norms\n    $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert$ and $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert'$ are equivalent as in\n    equation \\[condC\\]. Then, by the polarization identity, the inner\n    products satisfy\n    $$\\frac{1}{C^2}\\langle v,w \\rangle'  \\le \\langle v,w \\rangle  \\le C^2\\langle v,w \\rangle.$$\n\n5.  On a finite dimensional vector space all norms are equivalent (see\n    ). This is easy to understand as the unit sphere is compact if and\n    only if a space is finite dimensional. On infinite dimensional\n    spaces this result does not hold (see ).\n\n    It follows that on a finite dimensional vector space, one can check\n    continuity and convergence with respect with any norm. If a sequence\n    converges in one norm, it converges in all norms. In matrix analysis\n    this is particularly useful as one can choose the norm that is most\n    easily calculated.\n\n6.  The concept of equivalent norms also generalize to possibly\n    non-symmetric norms. In this setting, all norms are also equivalent\n    on a finite dimensional vector space. In particular,\n    $\\Vert\\cdot \\Vert$ and $\\Vert-\\cdot\\Vert$ are equivalent, and there\n    exists $C>0$ such that\n    $$\\Vert - v\\Vert \\le C \\Vert v\\Vert,\\quad v\\in V.$$",
