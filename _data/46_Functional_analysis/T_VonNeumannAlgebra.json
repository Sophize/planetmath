Thus, von Neumann algebras are a particular\nclass of and the results and tools from the $C^*$ theory are also\napplicable in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless, the\nphilosophy behind von Neumann algebras is quite different from that of\n$C^*$-algebras and the tools and techniques for each theory turn out to\nbe different as well.\n\nExamples: {#examples .unnumbered}\n=========\n\n1.  $B(H)$ is itself a von Neumann algebra.\n\n2.  as subalgebra of $B(L^2(\\mathbb{R}))$ is a von Neumann algebra.",
