  "definition": "Definition\n==========\n\n$C^*$-algebras are a type of involutive Banach algebras which arise in\nthe study of operators on Hilbert spaces, Lie group representations,\nlocally compact topological spaces, knots, noncommutative , among other\ntopics in mathematics and theoretical physics . Their study was\ninitiated in the 1930\u2019s with the purpose of axiomatizing quantum\nmechanics, and still today, $C^*$-algebras play a decisive role in\nformulations of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum .\n\nThe defining property of these algebras is that the norm and the\ninvolution are related in a very special way.\n\n[**Definition 1**]{} - *A **$C^*$-algebra** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach\n\\*-algebra such that ${\\Vert a^*a\\Vert} = {\\Vert a\\Vert}^2$ for all\n$a \\in \\mathcal{A}$*.\n\nThe equality in Definition 1 is sometimes called the [**$C^*$\naxiom**]{}. It turns out that one can weaken this condition and still\nspecify the same of algebras.\n\n[**Definition 2**]{} - *A **$C^*$-algebra** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach\nalgebra with an antilinear involution $*$ such that\n${\\Vert a\\Vert}^2 \\leq {\\Vert a^* a\\Vert}$ for all $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$.*\n\n[**Definition 3**]{} - *A **$C^*$-algebra** $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach\nalgebra with an antilinear involution $*$ such that\n${\\Vert a^* a\\Vert} = {\\Vert a^*\\Vert}{\\Vert a\\Vert}$*\n\nC\\* Norm\n========\n\n$C^*$-algebras are a very peculiar type of topological algebras. The\n$C^*$ axiom, deceptively , imposes severe on the the algebraic and\ntopological structure of a $C^*$-algebra.\n\nA most striking consequence of the $C^*$ axiom is that the norm is\nsolely determined by the algebraic structure of the algebra. More\nspecifically, $$\\|a\\| = \\sqrt{R_{\\sigma}(a^*a)}$$ where $R_{\\sigma}(x)$\ndenotes the spectral radius of the element $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$. For\n$C^*$ algebras with an identity element $e$ we can specify even further:\nthe norm of an element $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is determined by\n$$\\|a\\|^2 = \\sup \\{ |\\lambda|: \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C} \\;\\text{and}\\; a^*a- \\lambda e \\;\\text{is not invertible}\\}$$\n\nThis also implies that the norm in a $C^*$-algebra is unique, in the\nsense that there is no other norm in the algebra that satisfies that\n$C^*$ axiom, i.e. that turns the algebra into a $C^*$-algebra. This is a\nstark contrast to the case of general normed algebras, where one may\nfind many norms which are with the algebraic structure.\n\nMoreover, the $C^*$ norm occupies a unique amongst the possible norms\nfor an involutive algebra. Suppose that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $C^*$ algebra\nwith norm ${\\Vert \\cdot\\Vert}_{C^*}$. If ${\\Vert \\cdot\\Vert}_{B}$ is any\nother norm for which $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach \\*-algebra, then we must\nhave $$\\|a\\|_{C^*} \\leq \\|a\\|_B \\,, \\qquad \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}$$\nHence we see that the $C^*$ norm enjoys an extremal property \u2014 it is the\nsmallest possible norm for which $\\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach \\*-algebra.\n\nThere are many other surprising consequences of the $C^*$ axiom, like:\n\\*-homomorphisms between $C^*$-algebras are automatically continuous and\nevery $C^*$-algebra is semi-simple, which again are not true for general\ninvolutive algebras.\n\nElements of a C\\*-algebra\n=========================\n\nLike in involutory rings, there are some special elements in\n$C^*$-algebras that deserve some attention. We recall some definitions\nhere:\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be a $C^*$-algebra with identity element $e$. An\nelement $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is said to be\n\n-   [**self-adjoint**]{} if $a^* = a$\n\n-   [**unitary**]{} if $a^*a = aa^* = e$\n\n-   [**positive**]{} if $a = b^*b$ for some element $b \\in \\mathcal{A}$\n\nIt is many times useful to have some interpretation for this elements.\nOne of this interpretations comes from complex analysis: we regard the\nelements of a $C^*$-algebra as functions with values in $\\mathbb{C}$ and\nthe involution as complex conjugation.\n\nIn this frame, self-adjoint elements correspond to real functions,\nunitary elements correspond to functions whose values lie in the unit\ncircle in $\\mathbb{C}$ and positive elements correspond to positive\nfunctions (functions with values in $\\mathbb{R^+_0}$).\n\nIt is easily seen that self-adjoint elements are closed under addition,\nmultiplication and multiplication by real numbers. It can be proven the\nsame for positive elements (with multiplication by positive numbers).\n\nThere are some decompositions of elements in a $C^*$-algebra analogous\nto some decompositions in complex analysis. For instance, every element\n$a$ in a $C^*$-algebra has a unique decomposition of the form\n$$a = x + i y$$ where $x, y$ are self-adjoint. This is similar to the\ndecomposition of a complex valued function in its real and imaginary\nparts.\n\nMoreover, every self-adjoint element $a$ is of the form $$a = x - y$$\nwhere $x, y$ are positive elements. This is similar to the decomposition\nof real valued functions in its positive and negative parts.\n\nThere are many other aspects of the theory of $C^*$-algebras for which\nthis kind of interpretation proves to be very insightful.\n\nFor example, $C^*$-algebras happen to have a natural partial ordering.\nOne can define an ordering by declaring that $x > y$ when $x - y$ is\npositive. Given this ordering, one can then speak of such things as\nmonotonic functions, monotonic sequences, and positive linear\nfunctionals on the algebra. These notions, in turn, prove to be\nextremely useful in the study of $C^*$-algebras.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nHaving discussed these algebras in general terms, it is high time that\nwe illustrate the definition with some examples.\n\n[**Example 1**]{}\n\nAs our first class of examples, we consider algebras of functions. Let\n$X$ be a compact Hausdorff topological space and let $C(X)$ be the\nalgebra of continuous functions from $X$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. For the\ninvolution operation, we take pointwise complex conjugation and for the\nnorm we take the norm of uniform convergence:\n$${\\Vert f\\Vert} = \\sup_{x \\in X} |f(x)|$$ It is a routine matter to\ncheck that the norm and involution satisfy the appropriate algebraic\nrequirements. Completeness under this norm follows from the fact that\nthe uniform limit of continuous functions on a locally compact Hausdorff\ntopological space is continuous.\n\nMore generally, instead of a compact space, we can take a locally\ncompact Hausdorff space $X$ and consider the algebra $C_0(X)$ of\ncontinuous functions $X \\to \\mathbb{C}$ that vanish at infinity, endowed\nwith the same norm and involution. These are important examples of\n$C^*$-algebras.\n\n[**Example 2**]{}\n\nAs our second class of examples, we consider operator algebras. Let $H$\nbe a complex Hilbert space with inner product\n$\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle$ and let $B(H)$ be the algebra of bounded\noperators on $H$. For the involution, we take the adjoint operation and\nas a norm we take the usual operator norm:\n$${\\Vert T\\Vert} = \\sup_{\\|\\xi\\| = 1} \\|T\\xi\\|$$ Again, it is\nstraightforward to verify that the norm and involution satisfy the\nappropriate algebraic requirements, as is done in an attachment to this\nentry. Completeness under the norm follows from a well-known theorem of\nfunctional analysis.\n\nCommutative and noncommutative C\\*-algebras\n===========================================\n\nThe algebras $C_0(X)$ in Example 1 above are more than just an example.\nIn fact, all commutative $C^*$-algebras are \\*-isomorphic to $C_0(X)$\nfor some locally compact Hausdorff space $X$. Moreover, $X$ is compact\nif and only if the $C^*$-algebra has an identity element. This is the\ncontent of the Gelfand-Naimark theorem.\n\nFurthermore, there is a correspondence between properties of the\ntopological space and properties of the $C^*$-algebra. For example: a\ncompactification of the space corresponds to a unitization of the\n$C^*$-algebra; the space is connected if and only if the $C^*$-algebra\nhas no non-trivial projections, among many other interesting\ncorrespondences.\n\nFor this reason, the theory of (noncommutative) $C^*$-algebras is many\ntimes called noncommutative topology (click on the link for more\ninformation).\n\n$\\,$\n\nThe second example is also more than just an example of $C^*$-algebras.\nIn fact, by the Gelfand-Naimark representation theorem, all\n$C^*$-algebras are \\*-isomorphic to a norm closed \\*-subalgebra of\n$B(H)$, for some Hilbert space $H$.\n\nNote, however, that this does not provide a \u201cclassification\u201d of\n$C^*$-algebras since we do not know in general what are the closed\n\\*-subalgebras of $B(H)$. This is merely a (very-important) structural\ntheorem. The classification problem for $C^*$-algebras is still open.\n\nAdditional Examples\n===================\n\n[**Example 3**]{}\n\nCompact operators in a Hilbert space $H$ form a closed ideal of $B(H)$.\nMoreover, this ideal is also closed for the involution of operators.\nHence, the algebra of compact operators, $K(H)$, is a $C^*$-algebra.\n\n[**Example 4**]{}\n\nLet $(X, \\mathfrak{B}, \\mu)$ be a measure space. The space is an algebra\nunder pointwise operations. We can define an involution again by complex\nconjugation and we consider the essential supremum norm\n$\\| \\cdot \\|_{\\infty}$. It can be readily verified that, under these\noperations and norm, $L^{\\infty}(X)$ is a $C^*$-algebra.\n\nThe algebras $L^{\\infty}(X)$ are also particularly important since they\nare examples of von Neumann algebras, which are a specific kind of\n$C^*$-algebras.",
