  "definition": "A *Hilbert space* is an inner product space which is under the metric.\n\nIn particular, a Hilbert space is a Banach space in the norm by the\ninner product, since the norm and the inner product both induce the same\nmetric. Any finite-dimensional inner product space is a Hilbert space,\nbut it is worth mentioning that some authors require the space to be\ninfinite dimensional for it to be called a Hilbert space.",
