  "definition": "Let $f\\colon {\\mathbbmss{R}}\\to{\\mathbbmss{R}}$ be a function. We say\nthat $f$ is of class $C^1$ if $f'$ exists and is continuous.\n\nWe also say that $f$ is of class $C^n$ if its $n$-th derivative exists\nand is continuous (and therefore all other previous derivatives exist\nand are continuous too).\n\nThe class of continuous functions is denoted by $C^0$. So we get the\nfollowing relationship among these classes:\n$$C^0\\supset C^1\\supset C^2\\supset C^3 \\supset \\ldots$$\n\nFinally, the class of functions that have continuous derivatives of any\norder is denoted by $C^\\infty$ and thus\n$$C^\\infty = \\bigcap_{n=0}^\\infty C^n.$$ It holds that any function that\nis differentiable is also continuous (see ). Therefore, $f\\in C^\\infty$\nif and only if every derivative of $f$ exists.\n\nThe previous concepts can be extended to functions\n$f\\colon {\\mathbbmss{R}}^m \\to {\\mathbbmss{R}}$, where $f$ being of\nclass $C^n$ amounts to asking that all the partial derivatives of order\n$n$ be continuous. For instance,\n$f\\colon{\\mathbbmss{R}}^m\\to {\\mathbbmss{R}}$ being $C^2$ means that\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_j\\partial x_i}$$ exists and are all\ncontinuous for any $i,j$ from $1$ to $m$.\n\n### $C^n$ functions on an open set of ${\\mathbbmss{R}}^m$ {#cn-functions-on-an-open-set-of-mathbbmssrm .unnumbered}\n\nSometimes we need to talk about continuity not globally on\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}$, but on some interval or open set.\n\nIf $U\\subseteq {\\mathbbmss{R}}^m$ is an open set, and\n$f\\colon U\\to {\\mathbbmss{R}}$ (or $f\\colon U\\to {\\mathbbmss{C}}$) we\nsay that $f$ is of class $C^n$ if $\\partial^\\alpha f$ exist and are\ncontinuous for all multi-indices $\\alpha$ with $|\\alpha|\\le n$.
