  "definition": "The expression \u201c*diagonalizable operator*\u201d has several meanings in\noperator theory. The purpose of this entry is to present some commonly\nused concepts where this terminology appears.\n\nDefinition 1\n------------\n\nLet $H$ be a finite dimensional Hilbert space. A linear operator\n$T:H\\longrightarrow H$ is said to be [**diagonalizable**]{} if the\ncorresponding matrix (in a given basis) is a .\n\nThe above definition is equivalent to: There exists a basis of $H$\nconsisting of eigenvectors of $T$.\n\n[**Remark -**]{} This is a common definition in linear algebra.\n\nDefinition 2\n------------\n\nLet $H$ be a finite dimensional Hilbert space. A linear operator\n$T:H\\longrightarrow H$ is said to be [**diagonalizable**]{} if there is\nan orthonormal basis of $H$ in which $T$ is represented by a diagonal\nmatrix.\n\nThe above definition is equivalent to: There exists an orthonormal basis\nof $H$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$.\n\nAnother equivalent definition is: There exists an orthonormal basis\n$\\{e_1, \\dots, e_n\\}$ of $H$ and values\n$\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that\n$$T(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i \\langle x, e_i \\rangle e_i$$ [**Remarks\n-**]{}\n\n-   In such operators are also called [**unitarily diagonalizable**]{}.\n\n-   Diagonalizable operators (in this sense) are always normal\n    operators. The assures that the converse is also true.\n\nDefinition 3\n------------\n\nLet $H$ be a Hilbert space. A bounded linear operator\n$T:H\\longrightarrow H$ is said to be [**diagonalizable**]{} if there\nexists an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of $T$.\n\nAn equivalent definition is: There exists an orthonormal basis\n$\\{e_i\\}_{i \\in J}$ of $H$ and values $\\{\\lambda_i\\}_{i \\in J}$ such\nthat $$T(x)= \\sum_{i \\in J} \\lambda_i \\langle x, e_i \\rangle e_i$$\n\n[**Remarks -**]{}\n\n-   If $H$ is finite dimensional this is the same as definition 2.\n\n-   Diagonalizable operators (in this sense) are always normal\n    operators. For compact operators the converse is assured by an\n    appropriate version of the spectral theorem for compact normal\n    operators.\n\nDefinition 4\n------------\n\nLet $H$ be a Hilbert space. A linear operator $T:H\\longrightarrow H$ is\nsaid to be [**diagonalizable**]{} if it is to a in some , i.e. if there\nexists\n\n-   a measure space $(X, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$,\n\n-   a unitary operator $U: L^2(X) \\longrightarrow H$ and\n\n-   a function $f \\in$ such that\n\n$$T=U M_f U^*$$\n\nwhere $M_f: L^2(X) \\longrightarrow L^2(X)$ is the by $f$\n$$M_f(\\psi) = f .\\psi \\;\\;.$$\n\n[**Remarks -**]{}\n\n-   If $H = \\mathbb{C}^n$ the above definition is equivalent to say that\n    $T$ is unitarily diagonalizable (Definition 2). Indeed, we can think\n    of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ as $L^2(\\{1, \\dots, n\\})$ with the counting\n    measure. In this case, multiplication operators correspond to\n    diagonal matrices.\n\n-   Diagonalizable operators (in this sense) are necessarily normal\n    operators (since multiplication operators are so). The discussion\n    about the converse result is the content of general versions of the\n    spectral theorem.",
