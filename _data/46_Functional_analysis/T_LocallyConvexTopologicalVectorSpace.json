  "definition": "[**Definition**]{} Let $V$ be a topological vector space over a subfield\nof the complex numbers (usually taken to be $\\mathbb{R}$ or\n$\\mathbb{C}$). If the topology of $V$ has a basis where each member is a\nconvex set, then $V$ is a *locally convex topological vector space*\n[@folland].\n\nThough most vector spaces occurring in practice are locally convex, the\nspaces $L^p$ for $0<p<1$ are examples of spaces which are not locally\nconvex.\n\n[9]{} G.B.
