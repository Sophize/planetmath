  "definition": "It is sometimes convenient to allow the norm to take extended real\nnumbers as values. This way, one can accomdate elements of infinite norm\nin one\u2019s vector space. The formal definition is the same except that one\nmust take care in stating the second condition to avoid the\nindeterminate form $0 \\cdot \\infty$.\n\n[**Definition:**]{} Given a real or complex vector space $V$, an\n*extended norm* is a map $\\| \\cdot \\| \\to \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ which\nstaisfies the follwing three defining properties:\n\n1.  Positive definiteness: $\\| v \\| > 0$ unless $v = 0$, in which case\n    $\\| v \\| = 0$.\n\n2.  Homogeneity: $\\| \\lambda v \\| = | \\lambda | \\> \\| v \\|$ for all\n    non-zero scalars $\\lambda$ and all vectors $v$.\n\n3.  Triangle inequality: $\\| u + v \\| \\le \\| u \\| + \\| v \\|$ for all\n    $u, v \\in V$.\n\n[**Example**]{} Let $C^0$ be the space of continuous functions on the\nreal line. Then the function $\\| \\cdot \\|$ defined as\n$$\\| f \\| = \\sup_x |f(x)|$$ is an extended norm. (We define the supremum\nof an unbounded set as $\\infty$.) The reason it is not a norm in the\nstrict sense is that there exist continuous functions which are\nunbounded. Let us check that it satisfies the defining properties:\n\n1.  Because of the absolute value in the definition, it is obvious that\n    $\\| f \\| \\ge 0$ for all $f$. Furthermore, if $\\| f \\| = 0,$ then\n    $\\sup_x |f(x)| = 0$, so $|f(x)| \\le 0$ for all $x$, which implies\n    that $f = 0$.\n\n2.  If $f$ is bounded, then\n    $$\\| f \\| = \\sup_x | \\lambda f(x) | = \\sup_x | \\lambda | \\> | f(x) | = | \\lambda | \\sup_x | f(x) | = | \\lambda | \\> \\| \\| f \\|$$\n    If $f$ is unbounded and $\\lambda \\neq 0$, then $\\lambda |f|$ is\n    unbounded as well. By the convention that infinity times a finite\n    number is infinity, property (2) holds in this case as well.\n\n3.  If both $f$ and $g$ are bounded, then\n    $$\\| f + g \\| = \\sup_x | f(x) + g(x) | \\le \\sup_x ( | f(x) | + | g(x) | ) \\le \\sup_x  | f(x) | + \\sup_x | g(x) | = \\| f \\| + \\| g \\|$$\n    On the other hand, if either $f$ or $g$ is unbounded, then the right\n    hand side of (3) is infinity by the convention that anything other\n    minus infinity added to plus infinity is still infinity and infinity\n    is bigger than anything which could appear on the left.\n\nAn extended norm partitions a vector space into equivalence classes\nmodulo the relation $\\| u - v \\| < \\infty$. The equivalence class of\nzero is a vector space consisting of all elemets of finite norm.\nRestricted to this equivalence class the extended norm reduces to an\nordinary norm. The other equivalence classes are translates of the\nequivalence class of zero. Furthermore, when we use the distance\nfunction of the norm to define a topology on our vector space, these\nequivalence classes are exactly the connected components of the\ntopology.",
