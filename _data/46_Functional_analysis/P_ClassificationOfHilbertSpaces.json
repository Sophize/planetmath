  "statement": "Hilbert spaces can be classified, up to isometric isomorphism, according\nto their dimension. Recall that an isometric isomorphism of Hilbert\nspaces is an unitary transformation, therefore it preserves the vector\nspace structure along with the inner product structure (hence,\npreserving also the topological structure). Recall also that the\ndimension of a Hilbert space is a well defined concept, i.e. all\northonormal bases of an Hilbert space share the same cardinality.\n\nThe classification theorem we describe here states that two Hilbert\nspaces $H_1$ and $H_2$ are isometrically isomorphic if and only if they\nhave the same dimension, i.e. if and only if an orthonormal basis of\n$H_1$ has the same cardinality of an orthonormal basis of $H_2$.\n\nThis will be achieved by proving that every Hilbert space is\nisometrically isomorphic to an , where $X$ has the cardinality of any\northonormal basis of the Hilbert space in consideration.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[**Theorem 1 -**]{} Suppose $H$ is an Hilbert space and let $I$ be a set\nthat indexes one (and hence, any) orthonormal basis of $H$. Then, $H$ is\nisometrically isomorphic to $\\ell^2(I)$.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[**Theorem \\[Classification of Hilbert spaces\\] -**]{} Two Hilbert\nspaces $H_1$ and $H_2$ are isometrically isomorphic if and only if they\nhave the same dimension.\n\n$\\,$\n\n$\\,$\n\n[***Proof of Theorem 1:***]{} Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ an orthonormal\nbasis indexed by the set $I$. Let $U: H \\longrightarrow \\ell^2(I)$ be\ndefined by $$Ux \\,(i) := \\langle x, e_i \\rangle$$ We claim that $U$ is\nan isometric isomorphism. It is clear that $U$ is linear. Using\nParseval\u2019s equality and the definition of norm in $\\ell^2(I)$ it follows\nthat\n$$\\|x\\|^2 = \\sum_{i \\in I} |\\langle x, e_i \\rangle|^2 = \\sum_{i \\in I} |Ux\\,(i)|^2 = \\|Ux\\|^2_{\\ell^2(I)}$$\nWe conclude that $U$ is isometric. It remains to see that it is\nsurjective (since injectivity follows from the isometric condition).\n\nLet $f \\in \\ell^2(I)$. By definition of the space $\\ell^2(I)$ we must\nhave $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i \\in I} |f(i)|^2 < \\infty$, and therefore,\nusing the Riesz-Fischer theorem, the series\n$\\displaystyle \\sum_{i\\in I} f(i)e_i$ converges to an element\n$x_0 \\in H$. We now see that\n$$Ux_0 \\,(j) = \\langle x_0, e_j \\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in I} f(i)\\langle e_i, e_j\\rangle = f(j)$$\nor in other , $Ux_0 = f$. Hence, $U$ is surjective. $\\square$\n\n$\\,$\n\n[***Proof of the classification theorem :***]{}\n\n-   $(\\Longrightarrow)$ Of course, if the Hilbert spaces $H_1$ and $H_2$\n    are isometrically isomorphic, with isometric isomorphism $U$, then\n    if $\\{e_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is an orthonormal basis for $H_1$ than\n    $\\{Ue_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is an orthonormal basis for $H_2$. Hence, $H_1$\n    and $H_2$ have the same dimension.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   $(\\Longleftarrow)$ If the Hilbert spaces $H_1$ and $H_2$ have the\n    same dimension, then we can index any orthonormal basis of $H_1$ and\n    any orthonormal basis of $H_2$ by the same set $I$. Using Theorem 1\n    we see that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are both isometrically isomorphic to\n    $\\ell^2(I)$. Hence $H_1$ and $H_2$ are isometrically isomorphic.\n    $\\square$",
