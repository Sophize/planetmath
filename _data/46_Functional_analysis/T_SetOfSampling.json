  "definition": "#### Definition\n\nLet $F$ be a Hilbert space of functions defined on a domain $D$. Let\n$T = \\{t_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ be a finite or infinite sequence of points in\n$D$. $T$ is said to be a *set of sampling* for $F$ if the sampling\noperator $S: F \\rightarrow l^2_{|T|}$ defined by $$S: f \\mapsto \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nf(t_1) \\\\\nf(t_2) \\\\\n\\vdots \n\\end{pmatrix}$$ is bounded (i.e. continuous) and bounded below; i.e. if\n$$\\exists A,B>0 \\hbox{ such that } \\forall f \\in F, A\\|f\\|^2 \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{|T|} |f(t_i)|^2 \\leq B \\|f\\|^2.$$\n\n#### Relation to Frames\n\nUsing the Riesz Representation Theorem, it is easy to show that every\nset of sampling determines a unique frame in such a way that the\nanalysis operator of that frame is the sampling operator associated with\nthe set of sampling. In fact, let $t=\\{t_i\\}$ be a set of sampling with\nsampling operator $S_t$. Use the Riesz representation theorem to rewrite\n$S_t$ in terms of vectors $\\{g_i\\}$ in $F$: $$S: f \\mapsto \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nf(t_1) \\\\\nf(t_2) \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\langle f, g_1 \\rangle \\\\\n\\langle f, g_2 \\rangle \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ then note that\n$$\\forall f\\in F, A\\|f\\|^2 \\leq \\sum_{i} \\left| \\langle f, g_i \\rangle \\right|^2 \\leq B\\|f\\|^2,$$\nso the $\\{g_i\\}$ form a frame with bounds $A, B$, and $S_t = \\theta_g.$\n\n#### Reconstruction\n\nParticularly nice sets of sampling are those that correspond to tight\nframes, because then $\\theta_g^\\ast\\theta_g=\\theta_g^\\ast S_t=AI$, and\nit is possible to reconstruct the function $f$, given its values over\nthe set of sampling: $$f = \\frac{1}{A}\\sum_i f(t_i) g_i.$$ Sets of\nsampling which correspond to tight frames are referred to as tight sets\nof sampling.",
