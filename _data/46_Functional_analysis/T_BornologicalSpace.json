  "definition": "A [*bornivore*]{} is a set which absorbs all bounded sets. That is, $G$\nis a bornivore if given any bounded set $B$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$\nsuch that $\\epsilon B \\subset G$ for $0 \\leq \\epsilon < \\delta$.\n\nA locally convex topological vector space is said to be\n[*bornological*]{} if every convex bornivore is a neighborhood of 0.\n\nA metrizable topological vector space is bornological.\n\n[99]{} A.
