  "definition": "Let $V$ be a real (or complex) topological vector space and $X$ a subset\nof $V$. A [*conical neighborhood*]{} of $X$ is a cone in $V$ which is a\nneighborhood of $X$.\n\nIn the theory of pseudodifferential operators and in microlocal\nanalysis, we have to consider conical neighborhood of vectors located in\nsome fiber of a vector bundle.",
