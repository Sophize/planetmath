  "statement": "Let $X$ be a compact topological space and let $C(X)$ be the algebra of\ncontinuous real-valued functions on this space. In this entry, we shall\nexamine the maximal ideals of this algebra.\n\nLet $X$ be a compact topological space and $I$ be an ideal of $C(X)$.\nThen either $I = C(x)$ or there exists a point $p \\in X$ such that\n$f(p) = 0$ for all $f \\in I$.\n\nAssume that, for every point $p \\in X$, there exists a continuous\nfunction $f \\in I$ such that $f(p) \\not= 0$. Then, by continuity, there\nmust exist an open set $U$ containing $p$ so that $f(q) \\not= 0$ for all\n$q \\in U$. Thus, we may assign to each point $p \\in X$ a continuous\nfunction $f \\in I$ and an open set $U$ of $X$ such that $f(q) \\neq 0$\nfor all $q \\in U$. Since this collection of open sets covers $X$, which\nis compact, there must exists a finite subcover which also covers $X$.\nCall this subcover $U_1, \\ldots, U_n$ and the corresponding functions\n$f_1, \\ldots f_n$. Consider the function $g$ defined as\n$g(x) = (f_1(x))^2 + \\cdots + (f_n(x))^2$. Since $I$ is an ideal,\n$g \\in I$. For every point $p \\in X$, there exists an integer $i$\nbetween $1$ and $n$ such that $f_i (p) \n\\not= 0$. This implies that $g(p) \\neq 0$. Since $g$ is a continuous\nfunction on a compact set, it must attain a minimum. By construction of\n$g$, the value of $g$ at its minimum cannot be negative; by what we just\nshowed, it cannot equal zero either. Hence being bounded from below by a\npositive number, $g$ has a continuous inverse. But, if an ideal contains\nan invertible element, it must be the whole algebra. Hence, we conclude\nthat either there exists a point $p \\in x$ such that $f(p) = 0$ for all\n$f \\in I$ or $I = C(x)$.\n\nLet $X$ be a compact Hausdorff topological space. Then an ideal is\nmaximal if and only if it is the ideal of all points which go zero at a\ngiven point.\n\nBy the previous theorem, every non-trivial ideal must be a subset of an\nideal of functions which vanish at a given point. Hence, it only remains\nto prove that ideals of functions vanishing at a point is maxiamal.\n\nLet $p$ be a point of $X$. Assume that the ideal of functions vanishing\nat $p$ is properly contained in ideal $I$. Then there must exist a\nfunction $f \\in I$ such that $f (p) \\neq 0$ (otherwise, the inclusion\nwould not be proper). Since $f$ is continuous, there will exist an open\nneighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $f(x) \\neq 0$ when $x \\in U$. By\nUrysohn\u2019s theorem, there exists a continuous function\n$h \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(p) = 0$ and $f(x) = 0$ for all\n$x \\in X \\setminus U$. Since $I$ was assumed to contain all functions\nvanishing at $p$, we must have $f \\in I$. Hence, the function $g$\ndefined by $g(x) = \n(f(x))^2 + (h(x))^2$ must also lie in $I$. By construction, $g(g) > 0$\nwhen $x \\in U$ and when $g(x) \\in X \\setminus U$. Because $X$ is\ncompact, $g$ must attain a minimum somewhere, hence is bounded from\nbelow by a positive number. Thus $g$ has a continuous inverse, so\n$I = C(X)$, hence the ideal of functions vanishing at $p$ is maximal.",
