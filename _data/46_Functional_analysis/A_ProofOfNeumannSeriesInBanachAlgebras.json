  "argumentText": "Let x be an element of a Banach algebra with identity, $\\|x\\| < 1$. By\napplying the properties of the Norm in a Banach algebra, we see that the\npartial sums form a Cauchy sequence:\n$\\| \\sum_{n=l}^m x^n \\| \\leq \\sum_{n=l}^m \\| x\\|^n  \\to 0$ for\n$l,m \\to \\infty$ (as is well known from real analysis), so by\ncompleteness of the Banach Algebra, the series converges to some element\n$y=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n$.\n\nWe observe that for any $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n\n$$(1-x) \\sum_{n=0}^m x^n = \\sum_{n=0}^m x^n - \\sum_{n=1}^{m+1} x^n = 1-x^{m+1}$$\n\nFurthermore, $\\| x^{m+1} \\| \\leq \\| x \\|^{m+1}$, so\n${\\lim}_m x^{m+1} = 0$.\n\nThus, by taking the limit $m \\to \\infty$ on both sides of (1), we get\n\n$$(1-x) y = 1$$\n\n(We can exchange the limit with the multiplication by $(1-x)$, since the\nmultiplication in Banach algebras is continuous)\n\nSince the Banach algebra generated by a single element is commutative\nand $(1-x)$ and $y$ are both in the Banach algebra generated by $x$, we\nalso get $y (1-x) = 1$. Hence, $y = (1-x)^{-1}$.\n\nAs in the first paragraph, the last claim $y \\leq \\frac{1}{1-\\|y\\|}$\nagain follows by applying the geometric series for real numbers.",
