We say\nthat $g$ is the *weak derivative* of $f$ if the equality\n$$\\int_\\Omega f \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_i} = - \\int_\\Omega g_i \\phi$$\nholds true for all functions $\\phi\\in\\mathcal C^\\infty_c(\\Omega)$\n(smooth functions with compact support in $\\Omega$) and for all\n$i=1,\\ldots, n$. Notice that the integrals involved are well defined\nsince $\\phi$ is bounded with compact support and because $f$ is assumed\nto be integrable on compact subsets of $\\Omega$.\n\nComments {#comments .unnumbered}\n--------\n\n1.  If $f$ is of class $\\mathcal C^1$ then the gradient of $f$ is the\n    weak derivative of $f$ in view of Gauss Green Theorem. So the weak\n    derivative is an extension of the classical derivative.\n\n2.  The weak derivative is unique (as an element of the Lebesgue space\n    $L^1_{\\mathrm loc}$) in view of a result about locally integrable\n    functions.\n\n3.  The same definition can be given for functions with complex values.",
