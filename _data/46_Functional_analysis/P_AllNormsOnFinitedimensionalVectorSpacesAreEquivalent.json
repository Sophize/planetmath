  "statement": "All norms on finite-dimensional vector spaces over ${\\mathbb{R}}$ or\n${\\mathbb{C}}$ are .\n\nA consequence of this is that there is only one norm induced topology on\na finite dimensional vector space. This means that on such a vector\nspace, we need not worry about what norm we use when we talk about\nconvergence of a sequence of vectors in norm. So a standard use of this\ntheorem is in continuity arguments over finite dimensional vector\nspaces, and it allows you to pick the most convenient norm for your\nargument (the Euclidean norm is not always very convenient).\n\nThis obviously is not true for infinite dimensional spaces, for example\nsee the different . Note that the reason all this works is because a\nunit sphere is compact in a finite dimensional vector space, while that\nis not true in an infinite dimensional one.\n\nAny such finite-dimensional space is really just the same as\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ so we can talk about just those spaces. That is, any\nfinite-dimensional vector space over ${\\mathbb{R}}$ or ${\\mathbb{C}}$ is\nisomorphic to ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ for some $n$ (note that ${\\mathbb{C}}$ is\njust isomorphic to ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ as a vector space over\n${\\mathbb{R}}$). To see this, just write any element of the space in of\nthe basis and then define the isomorphism to take that basis to the\nstandard basis in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and then extend linearly.\n\nFirst let\u2019s show that if two norms are equivalent on the unit sphere\n(all $\\vec{x}$ such that $\\|\\vec{x}\\|=1$ with respect to some norm, for\nexample the standard Euclidean norm) then they are equivalent\neverywhere. We can write any $\\vec{x} \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ as a multiple\nof some scalar $\\gamma \\geq 0$ and a vector on the unit sphere, say\n$\\vec{x_0}$, that is $\\vec{x} = \\gamma \\vec{x_0}$. Then when suppose we\nhave two equivalent norms, say $\\|\\cdot\\|_a$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_b$, on the\nunit sphere $$\\begin{gathered}\n \\alpha \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n  \\leq\n \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_b\n  \\leq\n \\beta \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n\\\\\n \\gamma \\alpha \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n  \\leq\n \\gamma \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_b\n  \\leq\n \\gamma \\beta \\|\\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n\\\\\n \\alpha \\|\\gamma \\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n  \\leq\n \\|\\gamma \\vec{x_0}\\|_b\n  \\leq\n \\beta \\|\\gamma \\vec{x_0}\\|_a\n\\\\\n \\alpha \\|\\vec{x}\\|_a\n  \\leq\n \\|\\vec{x}\\|_b\n  \\leq\n \\beta \\|\\vec{x}\\|_a .\\end{gathered}$$ So the norms are equivalent\neverywhere.\n\nSuppose we are working with the 2-norm. Now we want to show that any\nother norm is a continuous function with respect to the 2-norm. Take an\narbitrary finite-dimensional space $X$ and an arbitrary norm\n$\\|\\cdot\\|$. Also suppose that $\\{ \\vec{b_i} \\}_1^n$ is a basis of $X$\nand so an element $\\vec{x} \\in X$ may be written as\n$\\vec{x} = \\sum_1^n x_i \\vec{b_i}$. Now given an $\\epsilon > 0$, choose\n$\\delta > 0$ such that $\\| \\vec{x} - \\vec{y} \\|_2 <\n\\delta$ (the Euclidean distance is less then $\\delta$) implies that\n$$\\max \\{ | x_i - y_i | \\} < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\|\\vec{b_i}\\|}$$\nIn fact we can just choose $\\delta$ to be the right side of the above\ninequality. Now we note that the triangle inequality immediately also\nyields the inequality\n$|\\,\\|\\vec{x}\\| - \\|\\vec{y}\\|\\,| \\leq \\|\\vec{x}-\\vec{y}\\|$. So\n$$\\begin{split}\n\\big|\\,\\|\\vec{x}\\| - \\|\\vec{y}\\|\\,\\big| & \\leq \\|\\vec{x}-\\vec{y}\\|\n\\\\\n& = \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\vec{b_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\vec{b_i} \\right\\|\n\\\\\n& = \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i) \\vec{b_i} \\right\\|\n\\\\\n& \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|\\, \\| \\vec{b_i} \\|\n\\\\\n& \\leq \\left( \\max_i |x_i-y_i| \\right) \\sum_{i=1}^n \\| \\vec{b_i} \\|\n\\\\\n& < \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\|\\vec{b_i}\\|} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\| \\vec{b_i} \\|\n\\\\\n& = \\epsilon .\n\\end{split}$$ And so $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is a continuous function.\n\nSuppose we are given two norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_a$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_b$, we know\nthat they are both continuous functions with respect to the 2-norm. And\nso the function defined as\n$$f(\\vec{x}) := \\frac{\\|\\vec{x}\\|_a}{\\|\\vec{x}\\|_b}$$ is a continuous\nfunction on the unit sphere (with respect to the 2-norm). This function\nis continuous except perhaps at 0, but we don\u2019t care about the value at\nzero. On the unit sphere however $f(\\vec{x})$ is continuous and thus\nachieves a maximum and a minimum since the unit sphere is compact. Let\u2019s\ncall the minimum and maximum, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ respectively. Then\nfor any $\\vec{x}$ on the unit sphere we have $$\\begin{gathered}\n \\alpha\n  \\leq\n f(\\vec{x})\n  \\leq\n \\beta\n\\\\\n \\alpha\n  \\leq\n \\frac{\\|\\vec{x}\\|_a}{\\|\\vec{x}\\|_b}\n  \\leq\n \\beta\n\\\\\n \\alpha\\|\\vec{x}\\|_b\n  \\leq\n \\|\\vec{x}\\|_a\n  \\leq\n \\beta\\|\\vec{x}\\|_b .\\end{gathered}$$ And so the norms are equivalent on\nthe unit sphere and thus as we shown above, everywhere.",
