Then $f$\nhas , i.e. $f(\\mathcal{A})$ is closed in $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nThus, the image $f(\\mathcal{A})$ is a $C^*$-subalgebra of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n$\\,$\n\n[***Proof:***]{} The kernel of $f$, $\\mathrm{Ker} f$, is a closed\ntwo-sided ideal of $\\mathcal{A}$, since $f$ is continuous (see ).\nFactoring threw the quotient $C^*$-algebra $\\mathcal{A}/\\mathrm{Ker} f$\nwe obtain an injective \\*-homomorphism\n$\\widetilde{f}:\\mathcal{A}/\\mathrm{Ker} f \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nInjective \\*-homomorphisms between $C^*$-algebras are known to be\nisometric (see ), hence the image\n$\\widetilde{f}(\\mathcal{A}/\\mathrm{Ker} f)$ is closed in $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nSince the images $\\widetilde{f}(\\mathcal{A}/\\mathrm{Ker} f)$ and\n$f(\\mathcal{A})$ coincide we conclude that $f(\\mathcal{A})$ is closed in\n$\\mathcal{B}$. $\\square$",
