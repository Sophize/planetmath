  "statement": "*Farkas\u2019 Lemma* of convex optimization and linear programming can be\nformulated for topological vector spaces.\n\nThe more abstract version of Farkas\u2019 Lemma is useful for understanding\nthe essence of the usual version of the lemma proven for matrices, and\nof course, for solving optimization problems in infinite-dimensional\nspaces.\n\nThe key insight is that the notion of linear inequalities in a finite\nnumber of real variables can be generalized to abstract linear spaces by\nthe concept of a cone.\n\nFormal statements\n-----------------\n\nFarkas\u2019 Lemma may be stated in the several equivalent ways. Theorem 1 is\nconceptually the simplest, but Theorem 2 and 3 are more convenient for\napplications.\n\nLet $X$ be a real vector spaces, and $X'$ be a subspace of linear\nfunctionals on $X$ that separate points. Impose on $X$ the weak topology\ngenerated by $X'$.\n\nGiven $x \\in X$, and a weakly-closed convex cone $K \\subseteq X$, the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n(a) $x \\in K$.\n\n(b) If $\\phi \\in X'$ satisfies $\\phi(y) \\geq 0$ for all $y \\in K$, then\n    $\\phi(x) \\geq 0$.\n\n(c) $\\phi(x) \\geq 0$ for all $\\phi \\in K^+$ (anti-cone of $K$ with\n    respect to $X'$).\n\nThe equivalence of conditions (a) and (c) is a fundamental property of\nthe anti-cone, while condition (b) is merely a rephrasal of condition\n(c).\n\nTheorem 2 is a version of Theorem 1 where the vector space and its dual\nspace switch roles.\n\nLet $X$ be a real vector space, and $X'$ be a subspace of linear\nfunctionals on $X$ that separate points. Impose on $X'$ the weak-\\*\ntopology generated by $X$.\n\nGiven a functional $f \\in X'$, and a weak-\\* closed convex cone\n$K \\subseteq X'$, the following are equivalent:\n\n(a) $f \\in K$.\n\n(b) $\\{ x \\in X\\colon f(x) \\geq 0\\} \\supseteq \\bigcap_{\\phi \\in K} \\{ x \\in X \\colon\n     \\phi(x) \\geq 0 \\}$.\n\nMake the substitutions $X \\to X'$, $X' \\to X$, $x \\to f$ and $K \\to K$\nin Theorem 1.\n\nTheorem 3 incorporates inequalities defined by linear mappings; such\nlinear mappings are the analogues to the matrices involved in the\nfinite-dimensional version of Farkas\u2019 Lemma.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be real vector spaces, with corresponding spaces of\nlinear functionals $X'$ and $Y'$ that separate points. Have $X'$ and\n$Y'$ generate the weak topology for $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\n\nGiven $y \\in Y$, a linear mapping $T\\colon X \\to Y$, and a subset\n$K \\subseteq X$ such that $T(K)$ is a weakly-closed convex cone, the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n(a) The linear equation $Tx = y$ has a solution $x \\in K$.\n\n(b) If $\\psi \\in Y'$ satisfies $\\psi(Tx) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in K$, then\n    $\\psi(y) \\geq 0$.\n\n(c) If $\\psi \\in Y'$ satisfies $T^* \\psi \\in K^+$ (anti-cone of $K$ with\n    respect to $X'$), then $\\psi(y) \\geq 0$.\n\nHere $T^* \\colon Y' \\to X'$ denotes the pullback, restricted to $Y'$ and\n$X'$, defined by $T^* \\psi = \\psi \\circ T$.\n\nMake the substitutions $X \\to Y$, $X' \\to Y'$, $x \\to y$ and\n$K \\to T(K)$ in Theorem 1. Condition (c) is a rephrasal of condition\n(b).\n\n[6]{} B. D. Craven and J. J. Kohila. \u201cGeneralizations of Farkas\u2019\nTheorem.\u201d *SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis*.
