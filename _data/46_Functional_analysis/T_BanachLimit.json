  "definition": "Consider the set $c_0$ of all convergent complex-valued sequences\n$\\{ x(n) \\}_{n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}}$. The limit operation\n$x \\mapsto \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x(n)$ is a linear functional on $c_0$, by\nthe usual limit laws. A [*Banach limit*]{} is, loosely speaking, any\nlinear functional that generalizes $\\lim$ to apply to non-convergent\nsequences as well. The formal definition follows:\n\nLet ${\\ell^\\infty}$ be the set of bounded complex-valued sequences\n$\\{ x(n) \\}_{n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}}$, equipped with the sup norm. Then\n$c_0 \\subset {\\ell^\\infty}$, and $\\lim\\colon c_0 \\to {\\mathbb{C}}$ is a\nlinear functional. A [*Banach limit*]{} is any continuous linear\nfunctional $\\phi \\in ({\\ell^\\infty})^*$ satisfying:\n\n1.  $\\phi(x) = \\lim_n x(n)$ if $x \\in c_0$ (That is, $\\phi$ extends\n    $\\lim$.)\n\n2.  ${\\lVert\\phi\\rVert} = 1$.\n\n3.  $\\phi (Sx) = \\phi(x)$, where\n    $S\\colon {\\ell^\\infty}\\to {\\ell^\\infty}$ is the shift operator\n    defined by $Sx(n) = x(n+1)$. (Shift invariance)\n\n4.  If $x(n) \\geq 0$ for all $n$, then $\\phi(x) \\geq 0$. (Positivity)\n\nThere is not necessarily a unique Banach limit. Indeed, Banach limits\nare often constructed by extending $\\lim$ with the Hahn-Banach theorem\n(which in turn invokes the Axiom of Choice).\n\nLike the limit superior and limit inferior, the Banach limit can be\napplied for situations where one wants to algebraically manipulate limit\nequations or inequalities, even when it is not assured beforehand that\nthe limits in question exist (in the classical sense).\n\nSome consequences of the definition\n===================================\n\nThe positivity condition ensures that the Banach limit of a real-valued\nsequence is real-valued, and that limits can be compared: if $x \\leq y$,\nthen $\\phi(x) \\leq \\phi(y)$. In particular, given a real-valued sequence\n$x$, by comparison with the sequences $y(n) = \\inf_{k \\geq n} x(k)$ and\n$z(n) = \\sup_{k \\geq n} x(k)$, it follows that\n$\\liminf_n x(n) \\leq \\phi(x) \\leq \\limsup_n x(n)$.\n\nThe shift invariance allows any finite number of terms of the sequence\nto be neglected when taking the Banach limit, as is possible with the\nclassical limit.\n\nOn the other hand, $\\phi$ can never be multiplicative, meaning that\n$\\phi(xy) = \\phi(x) \\phi(y)$ fails. For a counter-example, set\n$x = (0, 1, 0, 1, \\dotsc)$; then we would have\n$\\phi(0) = \\phi(x \\cdot Sx) = \\phi(x) \\phi(Sx) = \\phi(x)^2$, so\n$\\phi(x) = 0$, but\n$1 = \\phi(1) = \\phi(x + Sx) = \\phi(x) + \\phi(Sx) = 2\\phi(x) = 0$.\n\nThat $\\phi$ is continuous means it is compatible with limits in\n${\\ell^\\infty}$. For example, suppose that\n$\\{ x_k \\}_{k \\in {\\mathbb{N}}} \\subset \\ell^\\infty$, and that\n$\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x_k$ is absolutely convergent in ${\\ell^\\infty}$. (In\nother words, $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {\\lVertx_k\\rVert}_\\infty < \\infty$.)\nThen $\\phi(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty x_k) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\phi(x_k)$ by\ncontinuity. Observe that this is just the dominated convergence theorem,\nspecialized to the case of the counting measure on ${\\mathbb{N}}$, in\ndisguise.\n\nOther definitions\n=================\n\nIn some definitions of the Banach limit, condition (i) is replaced by\nthe seemingly weaker condition that $\\phi(1) = 1$ \u2014 the Banach limit of\na constant sequence is that constant. In fact, the latter condition\ntogether with shift invarance implies condition (i).\n\nIf we restrict to real-valued sequences, condition (ii) is clearly\nredundant, in view of the other conditions.",
