  "statement": "Let $X$ be a normed space, $Y$ a Banach space, $U\\subset X$ a connected\nopen set, $f\\colon U\\to L(X;Y)$ a continuous function, where $L(X;Y)$ is\nthe space of continuous linear operators. In this article a path is a\ncurve that has bounded variation. The following theorems give necessary\nand sufficient conditions for $f$ to have an antiderivatives.\n\nThe following conditions are equivalent:\n\n1.  $f$ has an antiderivative on $U$,\n\n2.  for any $\\gamma$ closed path in $U$ $\\int_\\gamma f=0$,\n\n3.  for any $\\gamma$, $\\delta$ paths in $U$ that have the same starting\n    and endpoints $\\int_\\gamma f=\\int_\\delta f$.\n\nThe next theorem states criteria for the existence of local\nantiderivatives.\n\nThe following conditions are equivalent:\n\n1.  $f$ has an antiderivative locally,\n\n2.  for $\\gamma$, $\\delta$ homotopic closed paths in $U$\n    $\\int_\\gamma f=\\int_\\delta f$,\n\n3.  if $\\gamma$ is a triangular path such that its convex hull is in\n    $U$, then $\\int_\\gamma f=0$.\n\nWith the stronger assumption that $f$ is differenciable we can obtain a\nmore easily applicable condition. We introduce the canonical isometric\nisomorphism\n$$\\pi_{1,1}\\colon L(X;L(X;Y))\\to L_2(X;Y),\\quad u\\mapsto((x_1,x_2)\\mapsto u(x_1)(x_2))$$\nwhere $L_2(X;Y)$ is the space of bilinear operators from $X$ to $Y$. If\n$F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then $\\pi_{1,1}(Df(x))=D^2F(x)$ and by\nClairaut\u2019s theorem the second derivative is symmetric. The following\ntheorems assert that the reverse is also true.\n\nIf $f$ is differentiable, then it has an antiderivative locally if and\nonly if $\\pi_{1,1}(Df(x))$ is symmetric for all $x\\in U$.\n\nCombining these three theorems immediately gives the following.\n\nIf $U$ is simply connected and $f$ is differentiable, then it has an\nantiderivative on $U$ if and only if $\\pi_{1,1}(Df(x))$ is symmetric for\nall $x\\in U$.",
