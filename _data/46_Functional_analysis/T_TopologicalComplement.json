The existence of topological complements, however,\n    is not always assured.\n\n-   If $X$ is an Hilbert space, then each closed subspace\n    $M \\subseteq X$ is topologically complemented by its orthogonal\n    complement $M^{\\perp}$, i.e. $$M \\oplus M^{\\perp} = X .$$\n\n-   Moreover, for Banach spaces the converse of the last paragraph also\n    holds, i.e. if each closed subspace is topologically complemented\n    then $X$ is isomorphic a Hilbert space.
