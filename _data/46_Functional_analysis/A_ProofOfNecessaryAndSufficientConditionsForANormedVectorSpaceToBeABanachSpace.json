  "argumentText": "We prove here that in order for a normed space, say $X$, with the norm,\nsay $\\|\\cdot\\|$ to be Banach, it is necessary and sufficient that\nconvergence of every absolutely convergent series in $X$ implies\nconvergence of the series in $X$.\\\n\\\nSuppose that $X$ is Banach. Let a sequence $(x_n)$ be in $X$ such that\nthe series $$\\sum_n{\\|x_n\\|}$$ converges. Then for all $\\epsilon > 0$\nthere exists $N$ such that for all $m > n > N$ we have\n$$\\left\\|\\sum_{n+1}^m{x_n}\\right\\|\\leq\\sum_{n+1}^m{\\|x_n\\|} < \\epsilon$$\nHence $$s_k = \\sum_{n=1}^k{x_n}$$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. Since $X$\nis Banach, $s_k$ converges in $X$.\\\n\\\nConversely, suppose that absolute convergence implies convergence. Let\n$(x_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $X$. Then for all $m \\geq 1$ there\nexists $N_m$ such that for all $k, k' \\geq N_m$ we have\n$\\|x_k - x_{k'}\\| < 1/m^2$. We\u2019ll conveniently choose $N_m$ so that\n$N_m$ is an increasing sequence in $m$. Then in particular,\n$\\|x_{N_m} - x_{N_{m+1}}\\| < 1/m^2$. Hence we have,\n$$\\sum_{m = 1}^M{\\|x_{N_m} - x_{N_{m+1}}\\|} < \\sum_{m=1}^M{\\frac{1}{m^2}}$$\nThe sum on the right converges, so must the sum on the left. Since\nabsolute convergence implies convergence, we must have\n$$\\sum_{m = 1}^M{(x_{N_m} - x_{N_{m+1}})}$$ converges as $M$ tends to\ninfinity. So there is an $s$ in $X$ which is the limit of the sum above.\nAs a telescoping series, however, the sum above converges to\n$\\lim_{M\\rightarrow\\infty}({x_{N_1} - x_{N_m}}) = s$. Since $s$ and\n$x_{N_1}$ are both in $X$, so is the limit of $x_{N_m}$, which is a\nsubsequence of the Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$. Hence $(x_n)$ converges in\n$X$. So $X$ is Banach.\\\n\\\nThis completes the proof.",
