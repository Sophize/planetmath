  "definition": "Motivation {#motivation .unnumbered}\n----------\n\nThe main motivation behind distribution theory is to extend the common\nlinear operators on functions, such as the derivative, convolution, and\nthe Fourier transform, so that they also apply to the singular,\nnon-smooth, or non-integrable functions that regularly appear in both\ntheoretical and applied analysis.\n\nDistribution theory also seeks to define suitable structures on the\nspaces of functions involved to ensure the convergence of suitable\napproximating functions, and the continuity of certain operators. For\nexample, the limit of derivatives should be equal to the derivative of\nthe limit, with some definition of the limiting operation.\n\nWhen this program is carried out, inevitably we find that we have to\nenlarge the space of objects that we would consider as \u201cfunctions\u201d. For\nexample, the derivative of a step function is the Dirac delta function\nwith a spike at the discontinuous step; the Fourier transform of a\nconstant function is also a Dirac delta function, with the spike\nrepresenting infinite spectral magnitude at one single frequency. (These\nfacts, of course, had long been used in engineering mathematics.)\n\n**Remark:** Dirac\u2019s notion of delta distributions was introduced to\nfacilitate computations in Quantum Mechanics, however without having at\nthe beginning a proper mathematical definition. In part as a (negative)\nreaction to such a state of affairs, von Neumann produced a\nmathematically well-defined based on actions of self-adjoint operators\non Hilbert spaces which is still currently in use, with several\nsignificant additions such as Frech\u00e9t nuclear spaces and quantum groups.\n\nThere are several theories of such *\u2018generalized functions\u2019*. In this\nentry, we describe Schwartz\u2019 theory of *distributions*, which is\nprobably the most widely used.\n\nEssentially, a distribution on ${\\mathbb{R}}$ is a linear mapping that\ntakes a smooth function (with compact support) on ${\\mathbb{R}}$ into a\nreal number. For example, the delta distribution is the map,\n$$f\\mapsto f(0)$$ while any smooth function $g$ on ${\\mathbb{R}}$\ninduces a distribution $$f\\mapsto \\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}} fg.$$\n\nDistributions are also well behaved under coordinate changes, and can be\ndefined onto a manifold. Differential forms with distribution valued\ncoefficients are called currents. However, it is not possible to define\na product of two distributions generalizing the product of usual\nfunctions.\n\nFormal definition {#formal-definition .unnumbered}\n-----------------\n\n*A note on notation.* In distribution theory, the topological vector\nspace of smooth functions with compact support on an open set\n$U\\subseteq {\\mathbbmss{R}}^n$ is traditionally denoted by\n${\\mathcal{D}}(U)$. Let us also denote by ${\\mathcal{D}}_K(U)$ the\nsubset of ${\\mathcal{D}}(U)$ of functions with support in a compact set\n$K\\subset U$.\n\nA *distribution* is a linear continuous functional on\n${\\mathcal{D}}(U)$, i.e., a linear continuous mapping\n${\\mathcal{D}}(U)\\to{\\mathbb{C}}$. The set of all distributions on $U$\nis denoted by ${\\mathcal{D}}'(U)$.\n\nSuppose $T$ is a linear functional on ${\\mathcal{D}}(U)$. Then $T$ is\ncontinuous if and only if $T$ is continuous in the origin (see ). This\ncondition can be rewritten in various ways, and the below theorem gives\ntwo convenient conditions that can be used to prove that a linear\nmapping is a distribution.\n\nLet $U$ be an open set in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, and let $T$ be a linear\nfunctional on ${\\mathcal{D}}(U)$. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $T$ is a distribution.\n\n2.  If $K$ is a compact set in $U$, and $\\{u_i\\}_{i=1}^\\infty$ be a\n    sequence in ${\\mathcal{D}}_K(U)$, such that for any multi-index\n    $\\alpha$, we have $$D^\\alpha u_i \\to 0$$ in the supremum norm as\n    $i\\to \\infty$, then $T(u_i) \\to 0$ in ${\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\n3.  For any compact set $K$ in $U$, there are constants $C>0$ and\n    $k\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}$ such that for all $u\\in {\\mathcal{D}}_K(U)$, we\n    have $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\label{ineq1}\n    |T(u)| &\\le& C \\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k} ||D^\\alpha u ||_\\infty,\\end{aligned}$$\n    where $\\alpha$ is a multi-index, and $||\\cdot||_\\infty$ is the\n    supremum norm.\n\n[**Proof**]{} The equivalence of (2) and (3) can be found on , and the\nequivalence of (1) and (3) is shown in [@rudin_fap].\n\n### Distributions of order $k$ {#distributions-of-order-k .unnumbered}\n\nIf $T$ is a distribution on an open set $U$, and the same $k$ can be\nused for any $K$ in the above inequality, then $T$ is a *distribution of\norder $k$*. The set of all such distributions is denoted by $D'^k(U)$.\n\nBoth usual functions and the delta distribution are of order $0$. One\ncan also show that by differentiating a distribution its order increases\nby at most one. Thus, in some sense, the order is a measure of how\n\u201dsmooth\u201d a distribution is.\n\n### Topology for ${\\mathcal{D}}'(U)$  {#topology-for-mathcaldu .unnumbered}\n\nThe standard topology for ${\\mathcal{D}}'(U)$ is the weak$^\\ast$\ntopology. In this topology, a sequence $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^\\infty$ of\ndistributions (in ${\\mathcal{D}}'(U)$) converges to a distribution\n$T\\in {\\mathcal{D}}'(U)$ if and only if\n$$T_i( u) \\to T(u)\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{(in ${\\mathbb{C}}$) as $i\\to \\infty$}$$\nfor every $u\\in {\\mathcal{D}}(U)$.\n\nNotes {#notes .unnumbered}\n-----\n\nA common notation for the action of a distribution $T$ onto a test\nfunction $u\\in {\\mathcal{D}}(U)$ (i.e., $T(u)$ with above notation) is\n$\\langle T,u\\rangle$. The motivation for this comes from .\n\n[9]{} W. Rudin, [*Functional Analysis*]{}, McGraw-Hill Book Company,\n1973. L.
