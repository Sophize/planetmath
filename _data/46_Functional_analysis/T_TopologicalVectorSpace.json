  "definition": "Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nA *topological vector space* is a pair $(V,\\mathcal{T})$, where $V$ is a\nvector space over a topological field $K$, and $\\mathcal{T}$ is a\ntopology on $V$ such that under $\\mathcal{T}$ the scalar multiplication\n$(\\lambda,v)\\mapsto\\lambda v$ is a continuous function $K\\times V\\to V$\nand the vector addition $(v,w)\\mapsto v+w$ is a continuous function\n$V\\times V\\to V$, where $K\\times V$ and $V\\times V$ are given the\nrespective product topologies.\n\nWe will also require that $\\{0\\}$ is closed (which is equivalent to\nrequiring the topology to be Hausdorff), though some authors do not make\nthis requirement. Many authors require that $K$ be either $\\R$ or $\\C$\n(with their usual topologies).\n\nTopological vector spaces as topological groups {#topological-vector-spaces-as-topological-groups .unnumbered}\n===============================================\n\nA topological vector space is necessarily a topological group: the\ndefinition ensures that the group operation (vector addition) is\ncontinuous, and the inverse operation is the same as multiplication by\n$-1$, and so is also continuous.\n\nFinite-dimensional topological vector spaces {#finite-dimensional-topological-vector-spaces .unnumbered}\n============================================\n\nA finite-dimensional vector space inherits a natural topology. For if\n$V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space, then $V$ is isomorphic to\n$K^n$ for some $n$; then let $f\\colon V\\to K^n$ be such an isomorphism,\nand suppose that $K^n$ has the product topology. Give $V$ the topology\nwhere a subset $A$ of $V$ is open in $V$ if and only if $f(A)$ is open\nin $K^n$. This topology is independent of the choice of isomorphism $f$,\nand is the topology on $V$ that makes it into a topological vector\nspace.",
