  "definition": "Given functions $f_1, f_2, \\dotsc, f_n$, then the *Wronskian\ndeterminant* (or simply the Wronskian) $W(f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dotsc, f_n)$\nis the determinant of the square matrix\n$$W(f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dotsc, f_n) = \\left\\lvert\\begin{array}{@{}ccccc@{}}\nf_1 & f_2 & f_3 & \\cdots & f_n\\\\\nf_1' & f_2' & f_3' & \\cdots & f_n'\\\\\nf_1'' & f_2'' & f_3'' & \\cdots & f_n''\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\nf_1^{(n-1)} & f_2^{(n-1)} & f_3^{(n-1)} & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right\\rvert$$ where $f^{(k)}$ indicates the $k$th derivative\nof $f$ (not exponentiation).\n\nThe Wronskian of a set of functions $F$ is another function, which is\nzero over any interval where $F$ is linearly dependent. Just as a set of\nvectors is said to be linearly dependent when there exists a non-trivial\nlinear relation between them, a set of functions\n$\\{f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dotsc, f_n\\}$ is also said to be dependent over an\ninterval $I$ when there exists a non-trivial linear relation between\nthem, i.e., $$a_1 f_1(t) + a_2 f_2(t) + \\dotsb + a_n f_n(t) = 0$$ for\nsome $a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_n$, not all zero, at any $t \\in I$.\n\nTherefore the Wronskian can be used to determine if functions are\nindependent. This is useful in many situations. For example, if we wish\nto determine if two solutions of a second-order differential equation\nare independent, we may use the Wronskian.\n\n#### Examples\n\nConsider the functions $x^2$, $x$, and $1$. Take the Wronskian:\n$$W = \\left\\lvert\\begin{array}{@{}ccc@{}}\nx^2 & x & 1\\\\\n2x & 1 & 0\\\\\n2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right\\rvert = -2$$ Note that $W$ is always non-zero, so\nthese functions are independent everywhere. Consider, however, $x^2$ and\n$x$: $$W = \\left\\lvert\\begin{array}{@{}cc@{}}\nx^2 & x\\\\\n2x & 1\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right\\rvert = x^2 - 2x^2 = -x^2$$ Here $W = 0$ only when\n$x = 0$. Therefore $x^2$ and $x$ are independent except at $x = 0$.\n\nConsider $2x^2+3$, $x^2$, and $1$:\n$$W = \\left\\lvert\\begin{array}{@{}ccc@{}}\n2x^2 + 3 & x^2 & 1\\\\\n4x & 2x & 0\\\\\n4 & 2 & 0\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right\\rvert = 8x - 8x = 0$$ Here $W$ is always zero, so\nthese functions are always dependent. This is intuitively obvious, of\ncourse, since $$2x^2 + 3 = 2(x^2) + 3(1)$$\n\nGiven $n$ linearly independant functions $f_1, f_2, \\dotsc, f_n$, we can\nuse the Wronskian to construct a linear differential equation whose\nsolution space is exactly the span of these functions. Namely, if $g$\nsatisfies the equation $$W(f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dotsc, f_n, g) = 0,$$ then\n$g = a_1 f_1(t) + a_2 f_2(t) + \\dotsb + a_n f_n(t)$ for some choice of\n$a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_n$.\n\nAs a simple illustration of this, let us consider polynomials of at most\nsecond order. Such a polynomial is a linear combination of $1$, $x$, and\n$x^2$. We have\n$$W (1, x, x^2, g(x)) = \\left| \\begin{matrix} 1 & x & x^2 & g(x) \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2x & g'(x) \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & g''(x) \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & g'''(x)\n\\end{matrix} \\right| = 2 g''' (x) .$$ Hence, the equation is\n$g''' (x) = 0$ which indeed has exactly polynomials of degree at most\ntwo as solutions.",
