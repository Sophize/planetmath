  "definition": "A *separating solution* of a smooth planar dynamical system is an\noriented smooth curve such that\n\n-   the curve is composed of trajectories of the dynamical system,\n\n-   the curve does not go through any equilibrium point,\n\n-   the curve is the boundary of some region in the plane.\n\nThe orientation of the curve is the same as the orientation of the\nsolutions. In addition the curve does not need to be connected. [@1]\n\n[1]{} Khovanski\u012d, A.G.: Fewnomials. American Mathematical Society,\nProvidence, 1991.",
