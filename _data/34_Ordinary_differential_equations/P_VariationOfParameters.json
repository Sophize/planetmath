  "statement": "The method of *variation of parameters* is a way of finding a particular\nsolution to a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation.\n\nSuppose that we have an $n$th order linear differential operator\n$$L[y] := y^{(n)} + p_1(t) y^{(n-1)} + \\cdots + p_n(t) y ,$$ and a\ncorresponding nonhomogeneous differential equation\n$$\\label{nonhom-diffeq}\n L[y] = g(t).$$ Suppose that we know a fundamental set of solutions\n$y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n$ of the corresponding homogeneous differential\nequation $L[y_c]=0$. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is\n$$y_c(t) = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t) + \\cdots + c_n y_n(t),$$ where\n$c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$ are constants. The general solution to the\nnonhomogeneous equation $L[y]=g(t)$ is then $$y(t) = y_c(t) + Y(t),$$\nwhere $Y(t)$ is a particular solution which satisfies $L[Y]=g(t)$, and\nthe constants $c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n$ are chosen to satisfy the appropriate\nboundary conditions or initial conditions.\n\nThe key step in using variation of parameters is to suppose that the\nparticular solution is given by $$\\label{part-sol-form}\n Y(t) = u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t) + \\cdots + u_n(t) y_n(t),$$ where\n$u_1(t),u_2(t),\\ldots,u_n(t)$ are as yet to be determined functions\n(hence the name *variation of parameters*). To find these $n$ functions\nwe need a set of $n$ independent equations. One obvious condition is\nthat the proposed ansatz satisfies Eq. . Many possible additional\nconditions are possible, we choose the ones that make further\ncalculations easier. Consider the following set of $n-1$ conditions\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n y_1 u_1' + y_2 u_2' + \\cdots + y_n u_n' &=& 0 \\\\\n y_1' u_1' + y_2' u_2' + \\cdots + y_n' u_n' &=& 0 \\\\\n  &\\vdots \\\\\n y_1^{(n-2)} u_1' + y_2^{(n-2)} u_2' + \\cdots + y_n^{(n-2)} u_n' &=& 0.\\end{aligned}$$\nNow, substituting Eq.\u00a0 into $L[Y]=g(t)$ and using the above conditions,\nwe can get another equation\n$$y_1^{(n-1)} u_1' + y_2^{(n-1)} u_2' + \\cdots + y_n^{(n-1)} u_n' = g .$$\n\nSo we have a system of $n$ equations for $u_1',u_2',\\ldots,u_n'$ which\nwe can solve using Cramer\u2019s rule:\n$$u_m'(t) = \\frac{g(t) W_m(t)}{W(t)}, \\quad m=1,2,\\ldots,n .$$ Such a\nsolution always exists since the Wronskian $W=W(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n)$ of\nthe system is nowhere zero, because the $y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n$ form a\nfundamental set of solutions. Lastly the term $W_m$ is the Wronskian\ndeterminant with the $m$th column replaced by the column\n$(0,0,\\ldots,0,1)$.\n\nFinally the particular solution can be written explicitly as\n$$Y(t) = \\sum_{m=1}^n y_m(t) \\int \\frac{g(t) W_m(t)}{W(t)} dt .$$\n\n[1]{}\n\nW.\u00a0E.\u00a0Boyce and R.\u00a0C.\u00a0DiPrima. *Elementary Differential Equations and\nBoundary Value Problems* John Wiley & Sons, 6th edition, 1997.",
