  "definition": "Let the general solution $y$ of the differential equation\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nF(x,\\,y,\\,\\frac{dx}{dy}) = 0\\end{aligned}$$ be given by the equation\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nG(x,\\,y,\\,C) = 0,\\end{aligned}$$ the so-called [*general integral*]{} of\n(1); herein $C$ means an arbitrary .\n\nSuppose that the family (2) of the integral curves of (1) has an\nenvelope. In any point of the envelope, the tangent line is also the\ntangent of one integral curve. Thus in such a point, all the three\nvalues $x,\\, y,\\,\\frac{dy}{dx}$ are same for the envelope curve and the\nintegral curve. But these values satisfy the equation (1). Accordingly,\nthis equation is satisfied also by the abscissa, ordinate and slope of\nthe envelope. This means that the envelope is an integral curve of the\ndifferential equation (1). Because the envelope does not belong to the\nfamily (2), it cannot be obtained from the equation (2) with any value\nof $C$.\n\nA solution of the differential equation (1) which cannot be obtained\nfrom the general integral, is called a [*singular solution*]{} of\nequation.\n\nAn envelope of the integral curves means always a singular solution, but\nsometimes a singular solution is only the locus of the singular points\nof the curves (e.g. for the equation $3y'\\sqrt{y} = 1$).\\\n**Note.** If the family (2) has an envelope, it may be found by\neliminating $C$ from the pair\n$$G(x,\\,y,\\,C) = 0, \\quad G\\,'_C(x,\\,y,\\,C) = 0.\\\\$$\n\n**Example.** Find the singular solution of the equation\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ny^2(1+y'\\,^2) = R^2.\\end{aligned}$$ We can separate the variables,\ngetting $$dx = \\pm\\frac{y\\;dy}{\\sqrt{R^2-y^2}}.$$ Integrating this\nyields $$(x\\!-\\!C)^2+y^2 = R^2,$$ which represents the family of circles\nwith radius $R$ and centres on the $x$-axis. The family has as envelope\nthe double line $y = \\pm R$; the functions $y \\mapsto \\pm R$ satisfy\nalso the differental equation (3) and thus are singular solutions of it.",
