  "statement": "Consider the differential equation $$x'=f(x)\n\\label{eq}$$ where $f$ is a $C^1$ vector field. Assume that $x_0$ is a\nhyperbolic equilibrium of $f$. Denote $\\Phi_t(x)$ the flow of (\\[eq\\])\nthrough $x$ at time $t$. Then there exists a homeomorphism\n$\\varphi(x)=x+h(x)$ with $h$ bouded, such that\n$$\\varphi\\circ e^{tDf(x_0)}=\\Phi_t\\circ\\varphi$$ is a sufficiently small\nneighboorhood of $x_0$.\n\nThis fundamental theorem in the qualitative analysis of nonlinear\ndifferential equations states that, in a small neighborhood of $x_0$,\nthe flow of the nonlinear equation (\\[eq\\]) is qualitatively similar to\nthat of the linear system $x'=Df(x_0)x$.",
