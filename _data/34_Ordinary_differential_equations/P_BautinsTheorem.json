  "statement": "There are at most three limit cycles which can appear in the following\nquadratic system $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} = p(x,y) &=&\\sum_{i+j=0}^2 a_{ij}x^iy^j \\\\\n\\dot{y} = q(x,y) &=& \\sum_{i+j=0}^2 b_{ij}x^iy^j\\end{aligned}$$ from a\nsingular point, if its type is either a focus or a center.\\\nIn 1939 N.N. Bautin claimed the above result and in 1952 submitted the\nproof [@BNN1]. [@GAV]\n\n[1]{} Gaiko, A., Valery: Global Bifurcation Theory and Hilbert\u2019s\nSixteenth Problem.
