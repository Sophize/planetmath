  "definition": "A system of ordinary differential equation is *autonomous* when it does\nnot depend on time *(does not depend on the independent variable)* i.e.\n$\\dot{x}=f(x)$. In contrast *nonautonomous* is when the system of\nordinary differential equation does depend on time *(does depend on the\nindependent variable)* i.e. $\\dot{x}=f(x,t)$.\\\nIt can be noted that every nonautonomous system can be converted to an\nautonomous system by adding a dimension. i.e. If\n$\\dot{\\textbf{x}}=\\textbf{f}(\\textbf{x},t)$\n$\\textbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ then it can be written as an autonomous\nsystem with $\\textbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and by doing a\nsubstitution with $x_{n+1} = t$ and $\\dot{x}_{n+1}=1$.",
