  "definition": "The Dirac delta \u201cfunction\u201d $\\delta(x)$, or *distribution* is not a true\nfunction because it is not uniquely defined for all values of the\nargument $x$. Similar to the Kronecker delta symbol, the notation\n$\\delta(x)$ stands for\n\n$$\\delta(x) = 0 \\;\\text{for}\\; x \\ne 0, \\;\\text{and}\\; \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\delta(x) dx = 1$$\n\nFor any continuous function $F$:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\delta(x) F(x)dx = F(0)$$\n\nor in $n$ dimensions:\n\n$$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\delta(x - s)f(s) \\, d^ns = f(x)$$\n\n$\\delta(x)$ can also be defined as a normalized Gaussian function\n(normal distribution) in the limit of zero width.\n\n**Notes:** However, the limit of the normalized Gaussian function is\nstill meaningless as a function, but some people still write such a\nlimit as being equal to the Dirac distribution considered above in the\nfirst paragraph.\\\nAn example of how the Dirac distribution arises in a physical, classical\ncontext is available\n\n[**Remarks:**]{} Distributions play important roles in Dirac\u2019s\nformulation of quantum mechanics.\n\n[9]{} W.
