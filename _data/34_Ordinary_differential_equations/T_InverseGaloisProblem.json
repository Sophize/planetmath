  "definition": "The inverse Galois problem is extremely to , yet one of the hardest\nproblems for theorists and . It generally asks for descriptions of the\nof groups that can occur as Galois groups. Of course, a significantly\nmore precise formulation is required, for example, because of a result\nthat that every Galois group is profinite, and every profinite group is\na Galois group. Also ambiguous is what field(s) we allow ourselves to\ninclude when computing the Galois group. Unfortunately, many of these\nrelated questions all go under the heading \u201cthe inverse Galois problem,\u201d\nso care must be taken to determine an exact formulation of the question\nbeing asked.\n\nAs an example of a partial solution to this question, it is known that\nevery finite abelian group occurs as the Galois group of an extension\nover $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by the Kronecker-Weber theorem), though it is *not*\nknown whether or not this is true for every finite (not necessarily\nabelian) group. This latter question can also be phrased in of the\nabsolute Galois group: \u201cDoes every finite group occur as a quotient\ngroup of the absolute Galois group\n$\\text{Gal}({\\overline}{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})$\u201d? Thus, an answer to\nthis question would not only reveal information about the nature of\nfinite Galois groups, but also shed light on one of the most elusive\nobjects in all of algebra and number theory.\n\nIt is also known (see Shafarevich\u2019 theorem) that every solvable group\noccurs as a Galois group.",
