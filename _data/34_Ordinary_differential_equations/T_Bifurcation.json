  "definition": "*Bifurcation* refers to the splitting of dynamical systems. The\nparameter space of a dynamical system is regular if all points in the\nsufficiently small open neighborhood correspond to the dynamical systems\nthat are equivalent to this one; a parameter point that is not regular\nis a bifurcation point.\n\nFor example, the branching of the Feigenbaum tree is an instance of\nbifurcation.\n\nA cascade of bifurcations is a precursor to chaotic dynamics. The\ntopologist Ren\u00e9 Thom in his book on catastrophe theory in biology\ndiscusses the cusp bifurcation as a basic example of (dynamic)\n\u2018catastrophe\u2019 in morphogenesis and biological development.\n\n[3]{}\n\n\u201cBifurcations\u201d,\n\n\u201cBifurcation\u201d,\n\n\u201cQuadratic Iteration, bifurcation, and chaos\u201d,",
