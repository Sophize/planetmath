  "definition": "The history\n-----------\n\nThe Lorenz equation was published in 1963 by a meteorologist and\nmathematician from MIT called Edward N. Lorenz. The paper containing the\nequation was titled \u201cDeterministic non-periodic flows\u201d and was published\nin the Journal of Atmospheric Science. What drove Lorenz to find the set\nof three dimensional ordinary differential equations was the search for\nan equation that would \u201cmodel some of the unpredictable behavior which\nwe normally associate with the weather\u201d[@2]. The Lorenz equation\nrepresent the convective motion of fluid cell which is warmed from below\nand cooled from above.[@2] The same system can also apply to dynamos and\nlaser. In addition some of its popularity can be attributed to the\nbeauty of its solution. It is also important to state that the Lorenz\nequation has enough properties and interesting behavior that whole books\nare written analyzing results.\n\nThe equation\n------------\n\nThe Lorenz equation is commonly defined as three coupled ordinary\ndifferential equation like $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} & = & \\sigma(y-x)\\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} & = & x(\\tau - z) -y\\\\\n\\frac{dz}{dt} & = & xy - \\beta z\\end{aligned}$$ where the three\nparameter $\\sigma$, $\\tau$, $\\beta$ are positive and are called the\nPrandtl number, the Rayleigh number, and a physical proportion,\nrespectively. It is important to note that the $x$, $y$, $z$ are not\nspacial coordinate. The \u201d$x$ is proportional to the intensity of the\nconvective motion, while $y$ is proportional to the temperature\ndifference between the ascending and descending currents, similar signs\nof $x$ and $y$ denoting that warm fluid is rising and cold fluid is\ndescending. The variable $z$ is proportional to the distortion of\nvertical temperature profile from linearity, a positive value indicating\nthat the strongest gradients occur near the boundaries.\u201d [@1]\\\n\nProperties of the Lorenz equations\n----------------------------------\n\n-   ****\\\n    The Lorenz equation has the following symmetry of ordinary\n    differential equation:$$(x,y,z) \\to (-x,-y,z)$$ This symmetry is\n    present for all parameters of the Lorenz equation *(see natural\n    symmetry of the Lorenz equation)*.\n\n-   ****\\\n    The $z$-axis is invariant, meaning that a solution that starts on\n    the $z$-axis *(i.e. $x=y=0$)* will remain on the $z$-axis. In\n    addition the solution will tend toward the origin if the initial\n    condition are on the $z$-axis.\n\n-   ****\\\n    To solve for the equilibrium points we let\n    $\\dot{\\textbf{x}} = f(\\textbf{x}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\sigma(y-x) \\\\\n    x(\\tau - z) -y \\\\\n    xy - \\beta z\n    \\end{bmatrix}$ and we solve $f(\\textbf{x})=0$. It is clear that one\n    of those equilibrium point is $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (0,0,0)$ and with some\n    algebraic manipulation we detemine that\n    $\\mathbf{x}_{C_1} = (\\sqrt{\\beta(\\tau-1)}, \\sqrt{\\beta(\\tau-1)}, \\tau-1)$\n    and\n    $\\mathbf{x}_{C_2} = (-\\sqrt{\\beta(\\tau-1)}, -\\sqrt{\\beta(\\tau-1)}, \\tau-1)$\n    are equilibrium points and real when $\\tau>1$.\n\n-   ****\\\n    If $\\sigma, \\tau, \\beta >0$ then all solution of the Lorenz equation\n    will enter an ellipsoid centered at $(0,0,2\\tau )$ in finite time.\n    In addition the solution will remain inside the ellipsoid once it\n    has entered. It follows by definition that the ellipsoid is an\n    attracting set. *(see all solution of the Lorenz equation enter an\n    ellipsoid)*\n\nAn example\n----------\n\n![image](lorenzx.eps)\\\n\n*(The $x$ solution with respect to time.)*\n\n![image](lorenzy.eps)\\\n\n*(The $y$ solution with respect to time.)*\n\n![image](lorenzz.eps)\\\n\n*(The $z$ solution with respect to time.)*\n\n![image](lorenz.eps)\\\n\nthe above is the solution of the Lorenz equation with parameters\n$\\sigma = 10$, $\\tau = 28$ and $\\beta = 8/3$.
