  "definition": "Let $\\gamma$ be a and $x_0$ be a steady state solution of\n$\\dot{x} = f(x)$. If $$\\gamma x_0 = x_0$$ then $\\gamma$ is called a\n*symmetry of the solution of $x_0$*.\\\nLet $\\gamma$ be a symmetry of the ordinary differential equation and\n$x_0(t)$ be a periodic solution of $\\dot{x} = f(x)$. If\n$$\\gamma x_0(t-t_0) = x_0(t)$$ for a certain $t_0$ then $(\\gamma, t_0)$\nis called a *symmetry of the periodic solution of $x_0(t)$*.\\\n\\\n**lemma:** If $\\gamma$ is a symmetry of the ordinary differential\nequation and let $x_0(t)$ be a solution*(either steady state or\nperiodic)* of $\\dot{x} = f(x)$. Then $\\gamma x_0(t)$ is a solution of\n$\\dot{x} = f(x)$.\\\n*proof:* If $x_0(t)$ is a solution of $\\frac{d x}{dt} = f(x)$ implies\n$\\frac{d x_0(t)}{dt} = f(x_0(t))$. Let\u2019s now verify that $\\gamma x_0(t)$\nis a solution, with a substitution into $\\frac{d x}{dt} = f(x)$. The\nleft hand side of the equation becomes\n$\\frac{d\\gamma x_0(t)}{dt} = \\gamma \\frac{dx_0(t)}{dt}$ and the right\nhand side of the equation becomes $f(\\gamma x_0(t))= \\gamma f(x_0(t))$\nsince $\\gamma$ is a symmetry of the differential equation. Therefore we\nhave that the left hand side equals the right hand side since\n$\\frac{dx_0(t)}{dt} = f(x_0(t))$. qed\n\n[1]{} Golubitsky, Martin. Stewart, Ian. Schaeffer, G.
