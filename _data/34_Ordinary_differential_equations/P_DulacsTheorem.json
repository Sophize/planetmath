  "statement": "Let $\\dot{x}=f(x)$ be an analytic planar system, then in any bounded\nregion of the plane there is at most a finite number of limit cycles.\nAlso any polynomial planar system has at most a finite number of limit\ncycles.[@PL]\\\n***note about the proof:*** The proof was given by Dulac in 1923, but an\nerror was found in the proof. In 1988 Jean Ecalle, Jacques Martinet,\nRobert Moussu, Jean Pierre Ramis and independently Yulij Ilyashenko\ncorrected the error in the proof.[@PL]\n\n[1]{} Perko, Lawrence: Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems.\nSpringer-Verlag, New York, 1991.",
