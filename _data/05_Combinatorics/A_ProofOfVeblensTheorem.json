  "argumentText": "The proof is very easy by induction on the number of elements of the set\n$E$ of edges. If $E$ is empty, then all the vertices have degree zero,\nwhich is even. Suppose $E$ is nonempty. If the graph contains no cycle,\nthen some vertex has degree $1$, which is odd. Finally, if the graph\ndoes contain a cycle $C$, then every vertex has the same degree mod $2$\nwith respect to $E-C$, as it has with respect to $E$, and we can\nconclude by induction.",
