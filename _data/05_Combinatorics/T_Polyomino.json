  "definition": "A polyomino consists of a number of identical connected squares placed\nin distinct locations in the plane so that at least one side of each\nsquare is adjacent to (i.e. completely coincides with the side of)\nanother square (if the polyomino consists of at least two squares).\n\nA polyomino with $n$ squares is called an [*n-omino*]{}. For small $n$,\npolyominoes have special names. A 1-omino is called a [*monomino*]{}, a\n2-omino a [*domino*]{}, a 3-omino a [*tromino*]{} or [*triomino*]{},\netc. The famous Tetris video game derives its name from the fact that\nthe bricks are [*tetrominoes*]{} or 4-ominoes.\n\n![All distinct 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-ominoes.

It is known that the\nnumber of free n-ominoes $A_n$ grows exponentially. More precisely, it\ncan be proven that $3.72^n < A_n < 4.65^n$.\n\nPolyominoes are special instances of [*polyforms*]{}.",
