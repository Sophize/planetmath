  "definition": "A *hypergraph* $\\mathcal{H}$ is an ordered pair $(V, \\mathcal{E})$ where\n$V$ is a set of *vertices* and $\\mathcal{E}$ is a set of edges such that\n$\\mathcal{E} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(V)$. In other words, an *edge* is\nnothing more than a set of vertices. A hypergraph is the same thing as a\nsimple incidence structure, but with terminology that focuses on the\nrelationship with graphs.\n\nSometimes it is desirable to restrict this definition more. The empty\nhypergraph is not very interesting, so we usually accept that\n$V \\not= \\emptyset$. Singleton edges are allowed in general, but not the\nempty one. Most applications consider only finite hypergraphs, but\noccasionally it is also useful to allow $V$ to be infinite.\n\nMany of the definitions of graphs carry verbatim to hypergraphs.\n\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is said to be $k$-*uniform* if every edge\n$e \\in \\mathcal{E}$ has cardinality $k$, and is *uniform* if it is\n$k$-uniform for some $k$. An ordinary graph is merely a $2-$uniform\nhypergraph.\n\nThe *degree* of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges in $\\mathcal{E}$\nthat contain this vertex, often denoted $d(v)$. $\\mathcal{H}$ is\n$k$-*regular* if every vertex has degree $k$, and is said to be\n*regular* if it is $k$-regular for some $k$.\n\nLet $V = \\{v_1, v_2, ~\\ldots, ~ v_n\\}$ and\n$\\mathcal{E} = \\{e_1, e_2, ~ \\ldots, ~ e_m\\}$. Associated to any\nhypergraph is the $n \\times m$ *incidence matrix* $A = (a_{ij})$ where\n$$a_{ij} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{ if } ~ v_i \\in e_j \\\\\n0 &\\text{ otherwise }\n\\end{cases}$$ For example, let $\\mathcal{H}=(V,\\mathcal{E})$, where\n$V=\\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace$ and\n$\\mathcal{E}=\\lbrace \\lbrace a\\rbrace, \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace, \\lbrace a,c\\rbrace, \\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace\\rbrace$.\nDefining $v_i$ and $e_j$ in the obvious manner (as they are listed in\nthe sets), we have\n\n$A =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNotice that the sum of the entries in any column is the cardinality of\nthe corresponding edge. Similarly, the sum of the entries in a\nparticular row is the degree of the corresponding vertex.\n\nThe transpose $A^t$ of the incidence matrix also defines a hypergraph\n$\\mathcal{H}^*$, the *dual* of $\\mathcal{H}$, in an obvious manner. To\nbe explicit, let $\\mathcal{H}^* = (V^*, \\mathcal{E}^*)$ where $V^*$ is\nan $m$-element set and $\\mathcal{E}^*$ is an $n$-element set of subsets\nof $V^*$. For $v^*_j \\in V^*$ and\n$e^*_i \\in \\mathcal{E}^*, ~ v^*_j \\in e^*_i$ if and only if\n$a_{ij} = 1$.\n\nContinuing from the example above, the dual $\\mathcal{H}^*$ of\n$\\mathcal{H}$ consists of $V^*=\\lbrace x,y,z,t\\rbrace$ and\n$\\mathcal{E}^*=\\lbrace \\lbrace x,y,z,t\\rbrace, \\lbrace y,t\\rbrace, \\lbrace z,t\\rbrace \\rbrace$,\nwhere $v^*_j$ and $e^*_i$ are defined in the obvious manner.\n\nBy the remark immediately after the definition of the incidence matrix\nof a hypergraph, it is easy to see that the dual of a uniform hypergraph\nis regular and vice-versa. It is not rare to see fruitful results emerge\nby considering the dual of a hypergraph.\n\n**Note** A finite hypergraph is also related to a metacategory, and can\nbe shown to be a special case of a supercategory, and can be thus\ndefined as a mathematical interpretation of ETAS axioms.",
