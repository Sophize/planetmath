  "definition": "For $n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$, the rising and falling factorials are\n$n{^{\\text{th}}}$ degree polynomial described, respectively, by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx^{{\\overline{n}}}&= x(x+1)\\ldots (x+n-1) \\\\\nx^{{\\underline{n}}}&= x(x-1)\\ldots (x-n+1)\\end{aligned}$$ The two types\nof polynomials are related by:\n$$x^{{\\overline{n}}}= (-1)^n (-x)^{{\\underline{n}}}.$$\n\nThe rising factorial is often written as $(x)_n$, and referred to as the\nPochhammer symbol (see hypergeometric series). Unfortunately, the\nfalling factorial is also often denoted by $(x)_n$, so great care must\nbe taken when encountering this notation.\n\n[**Notes.**]{}\n\nUnfortunately, the notational conventions for the rising and falling\nfactorials lack a common standard, and are plagued with a fundamental\ninconsistency. An examination of reference works and textbooks reveals\ntwo fundamental sources of notation: works in combinatorics and works\ndealing with hypergeometric functions.\n\nWorks of combinatorics \\[1,2,3\\] give greater focus to the falling\nfactorial because of its role in defining the Stirling numbers. The\nsymbol $(x)_n$ almost always denotes the falling factorial. The notation\nfor the rising factorial varies widely; we find $\\left<x\\right>_n$ in\n\\[1\\] and $(x)^{(n)}$ in \\[3\\].\n\nWorks focusing on special functions \\[4,5\\] universally use $(x)_n$ to\ndenote the rising factorial and use this symbol in the description of\nthe various flavours of hypergeometric series. Watson \\[5\\] credits this\nnotation to Pochhammer \\[6\\], and indeed the special functions\nliterature eschews \u201cfalling factorial\u201d in favour of \u201cPochhammer symbol\u201d.\nCuriously, according to Knuth \\[7\\], Pochhammer himself used $(x)_n$ to\ndenote the binomial coefficient (Note: I haven\u2019t verified this.)\n\nThe notation featured in this entry is due to D. Knuth \\[7,8\\]. Given\nthe fundamental inconsistency in the existing notations, it seems\nsensible to break with both traditions, and to adopt new and graphically\nsuggestive notation for these two concepts. The traditional notation,\nespecially in the hypergeometric camp, is so deeply entrenched that,\nrealistically, one needs to be familiar with the traditional modes and\nto take care when encountering the symbol $(x)_n$.\n\n[**References**]{}\n\n1.
