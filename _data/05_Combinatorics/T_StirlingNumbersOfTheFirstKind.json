  "definition": "#### Introduction.\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the first kind, frequently denoted as\n$$s(n,k)= { n\\brack k}, \\quad k,n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},\\quad 1\\leq k\\leq n,$$\nare the integer coefficients of the falling factorial polynomials. To be\nmore precise, the defining relation for the Stirling numbers of the\nfirst kind is:\n$$x^{{\\underline{n}}}= x(x-1)(x-2)\\ldots(x-n+1) = \\sum_{k=1}^n s(n,k)x^k.$$\nHere is the table of some initial values.\n\n  ----------------- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---\n  $n\\backslash k$      1     2    3     4   5\n  1                    1                  \n  2                   -1     1            \n  3                    2    -3    1       \n  4                   -6    11   -6     1 \n  5                   24   -50   35   -10   1\n  ----------------- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---\n\n#### Recurrence Relation.\n\nThe evident observation that\n$$x^{\\underline{n+1}} = x x^{{\\underline{n}}}-n x^{{\\underline{n}}}.$$\nleads to the following equivalent characterization of the $s(n,k)$, in\nterms of a 2-place recurrence formula:\n$$s(n+1,k) = s(n,k-1) - ns(n,k),\\qquad 1\\leq k < n,$$ subject to the\nfollowing initial conditions: $$s(n,0) = 0,\\qquad s(1,1) = 1.$$\n\n#### Generating Function.\n\nThere is also a strong connection with the generalized binomial formula,\nwhich furnishes us with the following generating function:\n$$(1+t)^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^n s(n,k) x^k\n\\frac{t^n}{n!}.$$ This generating function implies a number of\nidentities. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $t$ and\nequating powers, leads to the recurrence relation described above.\nTaking the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$ gives\n$$(k+1) s(n,k+1) = \\sum_{j=k}^n (-1)^{n-j}(n-j)!\\binom{n+1}{j}\ns(j,k)$$ This is because the derivative of the left side of the\ngenerating funcion equation with respect to $x$ is\n$$(1+t)^x \\ln(1+t) =(1+t)^x \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}\n\\frac{t^k}{k}.$$\n\nThe relation $$(1+t)^{x_1} (1+t)^{x_2} = (1+t)^{x_1+x_2}$$ yields the\nfollowing family of summation identities. For any given\n$k_1,k_2,d\\geq 1$ we have $$\\binom{k_1+k_2}{k_1} s(d+k_1+k_2,k_1+k_2) =\n\\sum_{d_1+d_2=d} \\binom{d+k_1+k_2}{k_1+d_1} s(d_1+k_1,k_1)\ns(d_2+k_2,k_2).$$\n\n#### Enumerative interpretation.\n\nThe absolute value of the Stirling number of the first kind, $s(n,k)$,\ncounts the number of permutations of $n$ objects with exactly $k$ orbits\n(equivalently, with exactly $k$ cycles). For example, $s(4,2)=11$,\ncorresponds to the fact that the symmetric group on 4 objects has $3$\npermutations of the form\n$$(* *)(* *)\\quad \\mbox{ --- 2 orbits of size 2 each},$$ and $8$\npermutations of the form\n$$(* * *)\\quad \\mbox{ --- 1 orbit of size 3, and 1 orbit of size\n  1},$$ (see the entry on cycle notation for the meaning of the above\nexpressions.)\n\nLet us prove this. First, we can remark that the unsigned Stirling\nnumbers of the first are characterized by the following recurrence\nrelation: $$|s(n+1,k)| = |s(n,k-1)| + n|s(n,k)|,\\qquad 1\\leq k < n.$$\n\nTo see why the above recurrence relation matches the count of\npermutations with $k$ cycles, consider forming a permutation of $n+1$\nobjects from a permutation of $n$ objects by adding a distinguished\nobject. There are exactly two ways in which this can be accomplished. We\ncould do this by forming a singleton cycle, i.e. leaving the extra\nobject alone. This accounts for the $s(n,k-1)$ term in the recurrence\nformula. We could also insert the new object into one of the existing\ncycles. Consider an arbitrary permutation of $n$ object with $k$ cycles,\nand label the objects $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$, so that the permutation is\nrepresented by $$\\underbrace{(a_1 \\ldots a_{j_1})(a_{j_1+1} \\ldots\n  a_{j_2})\\ldots(a_{j_{k-1}+1} \\ldots a_n)}_{\\displaystyle k \\mbox{\n    cycles}}.$$ To form a new permutation of $n+1$ objects and $k$\ncycles one must insert the new object into this array. There are,\nevidently $n$ ways to perform this insertion. This explains the\n$n\\,s(n,k)$ term of the recurrence relation. Q.E.D.",
