  "definition": "It is a standard exercise in elementary combinatorics to the number of\nways of rolling any given value with 2 fair 6-sided dice (by taking the\nof the two rolls). The below table the number of such ways of rolling a\ngiven value $n$:\n\n  ----- ------------\n   $n$   \\# of ways\n    2        1\n    3        2\n    4        3\n    5        4\n    6        5\n    7        6\n    8        5\n    9        4\n   10        3\n   11        2\n   12        1\n  ----- ------------\n\nA somewhat (un?)natural question is to ask whether or not there are any\nother ways of re-labeling the faces of the dice with positive integers\nthat these sums with the same frequencies. The surprising answer to this\nquestion is that there does indeed exist such a re-labeling, via the\nlabeling $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{Die }1&=\\{1,2,2,3,3,4\\}\\\\\n\\mbox{Die }2&=\\{1,3,4,5,6,8\\}\\\\\\end{aligned}$$ and a pair of dice with\nthis labeling are called a set of *crazy dice*. It is straight-forward\nto verify that the various possible occur with the same frequencies as\ngiven by the above table.",
