  "definition": "Let $G$ be a graph (in the sense of graph theory) whose set $V$ of\nvertices is finite and nonempty, and which has no loops or multiple\nedges. For any natural number $x$, let $\\chi(G,x)$, or just $\\chi(x)$,\ndenote the number of $x$-colorations of $G$, i.e. the number of mappings\n$f\\colon V\\to\\{1,2,\\ldots,x\\}$ such that $f(a)\\ne f(b)$ for any pair\n$(a,b)$ of adjacent vertices. Let us prove that $\\chi$ (which is called\nthe *chromatic polynomial* of the graph $G$) is a polynomial function in\n$x$ with coefficients in ${\\mathbb{Z}}$. Write $E$ for the set of edges\nin $G$. If $|E|$=0, then trivially $\\chi(x)=x^{|V|}$ (where $|\\cdot|$\ndenotes the number of elements of a finite set). If not, then we choose\nan edge $e$ and construct two graphs having fewer edges than $G$: $H$ is\nobtained from $G$ by contracting the edge $e$, and $K$ is obtained from\n$G$ by omitting the edge $e$. We have $$\\label{eq:ind}\n\\chi(G,x)=\\chi(K,x)-\\chi(H,x)$$ for all $x\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$, because the\npolynomial $\\chi(K,x)$ is the number of colorations of the vertices of\n$G$ which might or might not be valid for the edge $e$, while\n$\\chi(H,x)$ is the number which are not valid. By induction on $|E|$,\nshows that $\\chi(G,x)$ is a polynomial over ${\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nBy refining the argument a little, one can show\n$$\\chi(x)=x^{|V|}-|E|x^{|V|-1}+\\ldots\\pm sx^k\\;,$$ for some nonzero\ninteger $s$, where $k$ is the number of connected components of $G$, and\nthe coefficients alternate in sign.\n\nWith the help of the M\u00f6bius-Rota inversion formula (see Moebius\nInversion), or directly by induction, one can prove\n$$\\chi(x)=\\sum_{F\\subset E}(-1)^{|F|}x^{|V|-r(F)}$$ where the sum is\nover all subsets $F$ of $E$, and $r(F)$ denotes the rank of $F$ in $G$,\ni.e. the number of elements of any maximal cycle-free subset of $F$.\n(Alternatively, the sum may be taken only over subsets $F$ such that $F$\nis equal to the span of $F$; all other summands cancel out in pairs.)\n\nThe *chromatic number* of $G$ is the smallest $x>0$ such that\n$\\chi(G,x)>0$ or, equivalently, such that $\\chi(G,x)\\ne0$.\n\nThe *Tutte polynomial* of a graph, or more generally of a matroid\n$(E,r)$, is this function of two variables:\n$$t(x,y)=\\sum_{F\\subset E}(x-1)^{r(E)-r(F)}(y-1)^{|F|-r(F)}\\;.$$\nCompared to the chromatic polynomial, the Tutte contains more\ninformation about the matroid. Still, two or more nonisomorphic matroids\nmay have the same Tutte polynomial.",
