  "definition": "A [*matroid*]{} is a combinatorial structure whose properties imitate\nthose of linearly independent subsets of a vector space. Notions such as\nrank and independence (of a subset) have a meaning for any matroid, as\ndoes the notion of duality.\n\nDefinitions of a matroid\n========================\n\nA matroid permits several equivalent formal definitions: two definitions\nin terms of a rank function, one in terms of independent subsets, and\nseveral more. We discuss several definitions below.\n\nFirst rank definition {#first-rank-definition .unnumbered}\n---------------------\n\nA matroid consists of a set $E$ and a function\n$r\\colon\\mathcal{P}(E)\\to\\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the axioms:\n\n-   For any $S\\in\\mathcal{P}(E)$, $r(S)\\le |S|$.\n\n-   The function $r$ is order-preserving.\n\n-   The function $r$ satisfies the submodular inequality. That is, for\n    any $S$, $T\\in\\mathcal{P}(E)$,\n    $$r(S\\cup T) + r(S\\cap T) \\le r(S)+r(T).$$\n\nIn this situation, $r$ is called the [*rank function*]{} of the matroid\n$(E,r)$. If every singleton of $E$ has rank equal to 1, then $(E,r)$ is\ncalled a normal matroid.\n\nAn isomorphism of matroids $(E,r)\\to(F,s)$ consists of a bijection\n$f:E\\to F$ which preserves rank, that is, satisfies $s(f(A))=r(A)$ for\nall $A\\in\\mathcal{P}(E)$.\n\nSecond rank definition {#second-rank-definition .unnumbered}\n----------------------\n\nA matroid consists of a set $E$ and a function\n$r\\colon\\mathcal{P}(E)\\to\\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the axioms:\n\n-   $r(\\emptyset)=0$.\n\n-   If $x\\in E$ and $S\\in\\mathcal{P}(E)$, then $r(S\\cup\\{x\\})-r(S)$ is\n    either 0 or 1.\n\n-   If $x$, $y\\in E$ and $S\\in\\mathcal{P}(E)$, then\n    $r(S\\cup\\{x\\})=r(S\\cup\\{y\\})=r(S)$ implies $r(S\\cup\\{x,y\\})=r(S)$.\n\nIndependent set definition {#independent-set-definition .unnumbered}\n--------------------------\n\nA matroid is a pair $(E,\\mathcal{I})$ with\n$\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(E)$ (called the [*independent sets*]{}\nof $E$) satisfying the axioms:\n\n-   The empty set is independent.\n\n-   Every subset of an independent set is independent.\n\n-   For any $U\\subseteq E$, any two subsets of $U$ which are maximal\n    with respect to membership in $\\mathcal{I}$ have the same\n    cardinality.\n\nThe matroid $(E,I)$ is normal if every singleton in $E$ is independent.\n\nBase definition {#base-definition .unnumbered}\n---------------\n\nA matroid is a pair $(E,\\mathcal{B})$ with\n$\\mathcal{B}\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(E)$ (called the [*bases*]{} of $E$) a\nsubset of $\\mathcal{P}(E)$ satisfying the axioms:\n\n-   $E$ has at least one base.\n\n-   The proper subsets of a base are not bases.\n\n-   If $S$ and $T$ are bases and $x\\in E\\setminus S$, then for some\n    $y\\in E\\setminus T$, the set $(S\\cup\\{x\\})\\setminus\\{y\\}$ is a base.\n\nThe matroid $(E,\\mathcal{B})$ is called normal if each singleton of $E$\nis contained in a base of $E$.\n\nClosure definition {#closure-definition .unnumbered}\n------------------\n\nA matroid consists of a set $E$ and a function\n$\\operatorname{cl}\\colon\\mathcal{P}(E)\\to\\mathcal{P}(E)$, called the\n[*closure operator*]{}, satisfying the axioms:\n\n-   Any subset of $E$ is contained in its closure.\n\n-   If $S\\subseteq\\operatorname{cl}(T)$ then\n    $\\operatorname{cl}(S)\\subseteq\\operatorname{cl}(T)$.\n\n-   If $x$ is in the closure of $S\\cup\\{y\\}$ but not that of $S$, then\n    $y$ is in the closure of $S\\cup\\{x\\}$.\n\nThe closure operator is sometimes also called the [*span mapping*]{} of\nthe matroid. In this case $\\operatorname{cl}(A)$ is called the span of\n$A$.\n\nThe matroid $(E,\\operatorname{cl})$ is normal if the empty set is its\nown closure.\n\nCircuit definition {#circuit-definition .unnumbered}\n------------------\n\nA matroid is a pair $(E,\\mathcal{C})$ with\n$\\mathcal{C}\\subset\\mathcal{P}(E)$ (called the [*circuits*]{} of $E$)\nsatisfying the axioms:\n\n-   The empty set is not a circuit.\n\n-   The proper supersets of a circuit are not circuits.\n\n-   If $x$ is in the intersection of two distinct circuits $S$ and $T$,\n    then there is a circuit $U\\subseteq S\\cup T$ which does not contain\n    $x$.\n\nThe matroid $(E,\\mathcal{C})$ is normal if no singleton of $E$ is a\ncircuit.\n\nCombinatorial optimization definition {#combinatorial-optimization-definition .unnumbered}\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere\u2019s yet another definition of matroids from \u201cCombinatorial\nOptimization\u201d by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz. pp. 280-285.\n\nIt requires three definitions to generate their definition of matroids.\nThese are more or less grabbed from the book above.\n\nA [*subset system*]{} (E,g) is a finite set E with g a collection of\nsubsets of E closed under inclusion, meaning that if $A\\in g$, and\n$B\\subseteq A$, then $B\\in g$.\n\nDefinition 2: The [*\u201ccombinatorial optimization problem\u201d*]{}\n(nonstandard term used in book) is as follows. Let (E,g) be a subset\nsystem and weight w, a nonnegative real function on E. Find the subset\nin g with the largest total weight.\n\nDefinition 3: Let (E,g) be a subset system and w, a weight function\ndefined as above to give the \u201ccombinatorial optimization problem\u201d. The\ngreedy algorithm for construction of a subset I in g is as follows.\nStart with I being the empty set. Take the next highest weight element,\ne in E (w(e) &gt;= w(f) for all f in E). If the union of I and [e]{} is\nin g, then add element e to I. Repeat until you exhaust all elements of\nE.\n\nNow we have the definition of a matroid.\n\nDefinition 4:Let M=(E,g) be a subset system. M is a \u201cmatroid\u201d if the\ngreedy algorithm correctly solves the \u201ccombinatorial optimization\nproblem\u201d for any weight function associated with M.\n\nEquivalence of the definitions\n==============================\n\nIt would take several pages to spell out what is a circuit in terms of\nrank, and likewise for each other possible pair of the alternative\ndefining notions, and then to prove that the various sets of axioms\nunambiguously define the same structure. So let me sketch just one\nexample: the equivalence of Definitions 1 (on rank) and 6 (on circuits).\nAssume first the conditions in Definition 1. Define a circuit as a\nminimal subset $A$ of $\\mathcal{P}(E)$ having the property $r(A)<|A|$.\nWith a little effort, we verify the axioms (c1)-(c3). Now assume\n(c1)-(c3), and let $r(A)$ be the largest integer $n$ such that $A$ has a\nsubset $B$ for which\n\n\u2013 $B$ contains no element of $C$\n\n\u2013 $n=|B|$.\n\nOne now proves (r1)-(r3). Next, one shows that if we define $C$ in terms\nof $r$, and then another rank function $s$ in terms of $C$, we end up\nwith $s$=$r$. The equivalence of (r\\*) and (c\\*) is easy enough as well.\n\nExamples of matroids\n====================\n\nLet $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$, and let $E$ be a finite\nsubset of $V$. For $S\\subset E$, let $r(S)$ be the dimension of the\nsubspace of $V$ generated by $S$. Then $(E,r)$ is a matroid. Such a\nmatroid, or one isomorphic to it, is said to be representable over $k$.\nThe matroid is normal iff $0\\notin E$. There exist matroids which are\nnot representable over any field.\n\nThe second example of a matroid comes from graph theory. The following\ndefinition will be rather informal, partly because the terminology of\ngraph theory is not very well standardised. For our present purpose, a\ngraph consists of a finite set $V$, whose elements are called vertices,\nplus a set $E$ of two-element subsets of $V$, called edges. A circuit in\nthe graph is a finite set of at least three edges which can be arranged\nin a cycle: $$\\{a,b\\},\\{b,c\\},\\ldots \\{y,z\\},\\{z,a\\}$$ such that the\nvertices $a,b,\\ldots z$ are distinct. With circuits thus defined, $E$\nsatisfies the axioms in Definition 6, and is thus a matroid, and in fact\na normal matroid. (The definition is easily adjusted to permit graphs\nwith loops, which define non-normal matroids.) Such a matroid, or one\nisomorphic to it, is called \u201cgraphic\u201d.\n\nLet $E=A\\cup B$ be a finite set, where $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and\ndisjoint. Let $G$ a subset of $A\\times B$. We get a \u201cmatching\u201d matroid\non $E$ as follows. Each element of $E$ defines a \u201cline\u201d which is a\nsubset (a row or column) of the set $A\\times B$. Let us call the\nelements of $G$ \u201cpoints\u201d. For any $S\\subset E$ let $r(S)$ be the largest\nnumber $n$ such that for some set of points $P$:\n\n\u2013 $|P| = n$\n\n\u2013 No two points of $P$ are on the same line\n\n\u2013 Any point of $P$ is on a line defined by an element of $S$.\n\nOne can prove (it is not trivial) that $r$ is the rank function of a\nmatroid on $E$. That matroid is normal iff every line contains at least\none point. Matching matroids participate in combinatorics, in connection\nwith results on \u201ctransversals\u201d, such as Hall\u2019s marriage theorem.\n\nThe dual of a matroid\n=====================\n\nProposition: Let $E$ be a matroid and $r$ its rank function. Define a\nmapping $s:\\beta(E)\\to{\\mathbb{N}}$ by $$s(A)=|A|-r(E)+r(E-A).$$ Then\nthe pair $(E,s)$ is a matroid (called the dual of $(E,r)$.\n\nWe leave the proof as an exercise. Also, it is easy to verify that the\ndual of the dual is the original matroid. A circuit in $(E,s)$ is also\nreferred to as a cocircuit in $(E,r)$. There is a notion of cobasis\nalso, and cospan.\n\nIf the dual of $E$ is graphic, $E$ is called cographic. This notion of\nduality agrees with the notion of same name in the theory of planar\ngraphs (and likewise in linear algebra): given a plane graph, the dual\nof its matroid is the matroid of the dual graph. A matroid that is both\ngraphic and cographic is called planar, and various criteria for\nplanarity of a graph can be extended to matroids. The notion of\norientability can also be extended from graphs to matroids.\n\nBinary matroids\n===============\n\nA matroid is said to be binary if it is representable over the field of\ntwo elements. There are several other (equivalent) characterisations of\na binary matroid $(E,r)$, such as:\n\n\u2013 The symmetric difference of any family of circuits is the union of a\nfamily of pairwise disjoint circuits.\n\n\u2013 For any circuit $C$ and cocircuit $D$, we have\n$|C\\cap D|\\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nAny graphic matroid is binary. The dual of a binary matroid is binary.\n\nMiscellaneous\n=============\n\nThe definition of the chromatic polynomial of a graph,\n$$\\chi(x)=\\sum_{F\\subset E}(-1)^{|F|}x^{r(E)-r(F)},$$ extends without\nchange to any matroid. This polynomial has something to say about the\ndecomposibility of matroids into simpler ones.\n\nAlso on the topic of decomposibility, matroids have a sort of structure\ntheory, in terms of what are called minors and separators. That theory,\ndue to Tutte, goes by induction; roughly speaking, it is an adaptation\nof the old algorithms for putting a matrix into a canonical form.\n\nAlong the same lines are several theorems on \u201cbasis exchange\u201d, such as\nthe following. Let $E$ be a matroid and let $$A=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}$$\n$$B=\\{b_1,\\ldots,b_n\\}$$ be two (equipotent) bases of $E$. There exists\na permutation $\\psi$ of the set $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that, for every\n$m$ from $0$ to $n$,\n$$\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_m,b_{\\psi(m+1)},\\ldots,b_{\\psi(n)}\\}$$ is a basis of\n$E$.\n\nFurther reading\n===============\n\nA good textbook is:\n\nJames G. Oxley, *Matroid Theory*, Oxford University Press, New York\netc., 1992\n\nplus the updates-and-errata file at Dr. Oxley\u2019s .\n\nThe chromatic polynomial is not discussed in Oxley, but see e.g. .",
