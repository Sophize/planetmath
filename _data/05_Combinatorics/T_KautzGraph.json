  "definition": "The [*Kautz graph*]{} ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$ is a digraph (directed graph)\nof degree $K$ and dimension $N+ 1$, which has $(K +1)K^{N}$ vertices\nlabeled by all possible strings $s_0 \\cdots s_N$ of length $N\n+ 1$ which are composed of characters $s_i$ chosen from an alphabet $A$\ncontaining $K + 1$ distinct symbols, subject to the condition that\nadjacent characters in the string cannot be equal ($s_i \\neq s_{i+\n1}$).\n\nThe Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$ has $(K + 1)K^{N + 1}$ edges\n$$\\{(s_0 s_1 \\cdots s_N,\ns_1 s_2 \\cdots s_N s_{N + 1})| \\; s_i \\in A \\; s_i \\neq s_{i\n  + 1} \\} \\,.\n\\label{eq:}$$ It is natural to label each such edge of\n${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$ as $s_0s_1 \\cdots s_{N + 1}$, giving a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between edges of the Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$ and\nvertices of the Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 2}$.\n\n[**Example:**]{}\n\nThe Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_2^{2}$ has 6 nodes, and is depicted in the\nfollowing figure (using the alphabet $A$ ={0, 1, 2})\n\n![image](C:wati22-8.eps)\n\n[**Properties:**]{}\n\n$\\bullet$ The diameter of the Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_K^{N}$ is $N$\\\n(For example, there is a path of length $N$ from $x$ to $y$ achieved by\nthe sequence of edges $(x_0 x_1 \\cdots x_N, x_1 \\cdots x_N y_0)$,\n\u2026$(x_N y_0 \\cdots y_{N -1}, y_0 \\cdots y_N)$ unless $x_N = y_0$ in which\ncase there is a similar path of length $N -1$ beginning\n$(x_0 x_1 \\cdots x_{N-1} y_0, x_1 \\cdots x_{N-1} y_0 y_1), \\ldots$.)\n\n$\\bullet$ Kautz graphs are closely related to [*de Bruijn graphs*]{},\nwhich are defined similarly but without the condition\n$s_i \\neq s_{i + 1}$, and with an alphabet of only $K$ symbols for the\ndegree $K$ de Bruijn graph.\n\n$\\bullet$ For a fixed degree $K$ and number of vertices\n$V = (K + 1) K^N$, the Kautz graph has the smallest diameter of any\npossible directed graph with $V$ vertices and degree $K$.\n\n$\\bullet$ All Kautz graphs have Eulerian cycles\\\n(An Eulerian cycle is one which visits each edge exactly once\u2013 This\nresult follows because Kautz graphs have in-degree equal to out-degree\nfor each node)\n\n$\\bullet$ All Kautz graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle\\\n(This result follows from the correspondence described above between\nedges of the Kautz graph ${\\cal K}_K^{N}$ and vertices of the Kautz\ngraph ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$; a Hamiltonian cycle on ${\\cal K}_K^{N + 1}$\nis given by an Eulerian cycle on ${\\cal K}_K^{N}$)\n\n$\\bullet$ A degree-$k$ Kautz graph has $k$ disjoint paths from any node\n$x$ to any other node $y$.",
