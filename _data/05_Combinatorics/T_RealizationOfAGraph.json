  "definition": "A *realization of a graph* $G$ in a topological space $X$ is an\ninjective map $\\rho:G\\to X$ such that $G$ with the graph topology is\nhomeomorphic to $\\rho(G)$ with the subspace topology. Of particular\ninterest are realizations of $G$ in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, where\neach of the edges is a line segment, and where no 4 points of $G$ are\ncoplanar.",
