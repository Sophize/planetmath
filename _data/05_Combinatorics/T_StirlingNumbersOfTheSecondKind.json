  "definition": "#### Summary.\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind,\n$$S(n,k) = {n \\brace k}, \\quad k,n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},\\quad 1\\leq k\\leq n,$$\nare a doubly indexed sequence of natural numbers, enjoying a wealth of\ninteresting combinatorial properties. There exist several logically\nequivalent characterizations, but the starting point of the present\nentry will be the following definition:\n\n> The Stirling number $S(n,k)$ is the number of ways to partition a set\n> of $n$ objects into $k$ groups.\n\nFor example, $S(4,2) = 7$ because there are seven ways to partition 4\nobjects \u2014 call them a, b, c, d \u2014 into two groups, namely: $$(a)(bcd),\\;\n(b)(acd),\\;\n(c)(abd),\\;\n(d)(abc),\\;\n(ab)(cd),\\;\n(ac)(bd),\\;\n(ad)(bc)$$\n\nFour additional characterizations will be discussed in this entry:\n\n-   a recurrence relation\n\n-   a generating function related to the falling factorial\n\n-   differential operators\n\n-   a double-index generating function\n\nEach of these will be discussed below, and shown to be equivalent.\n\n#### A recurrence relation.\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind can be characterized in terms of\nthe following recurrence relation:\n$$S(n,k) = kS(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1),\\qquad 1\\leq k < n,$$ subject to the\nfollowing initial conditions: $$S(n,n) = S(n,1) = 1.$$ Let us now show\nthat the recurrence formula follows from the enumerative definition.\nEvidently, there is only one way to partition $n$ objects into $1$ group\n(everything is in that group), and only one way to partition $n$ objects\ninto $n$ groups (every object is a group all by itself). Proceeding\nrecursively, a division of $n$ objects $a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, a_n$ into\n$k$ groups can be achieved by only one of two basic maneuvers:\n\n-   We could partition the first $n-1$ objects into $k$ groups, and then\n    add object $a_n$ into one of those groups. There are $k\n      S(n-1,k)$ ways to do this.\n\n-   We could partition the first $n-1$ objects into $k-1$ groups and\n    then add object $a_n$ as a new, 1 element group. This gives an\n    additional $S(n-1,k-1)$ ways to create the desired partition.\n\nThe recursive point of view, therefore explains the connection between\nthe recurrence formula, and the original definition.\n\nUsing the recurrence formula we can easily obtain a table of the initial\nStirling numbers:\n\n  ----------------- --- ---- ---- ---- ---\n  $n\\backslash k$    1   2    3    4    5\n  1                  1                 \n  2                  1   1             \n  3                  1   3    1        \n  4                  1   7    6    1   \n  5                  1   15   25   10   1\n  ----------------- --- ---- ---- ---- ---\n\n#### Falling Factorials.\n\nConsider the vector space of polynomials in indeterminate $x$. The most\nobvious basis of this infinite-dimensional vector space is the sequence\nof monomial powers: $x^n,\\quad n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}.$ However, the sequence\nof falling factorials:\n$$x^{{\\underline{n}}}=x(x-1)(x-2)\\ldots(x-n+1),\\quad n\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$$\nis also a basis, and hence can be used to generate the monomial basis.\nIndeed, the Stirling numbers of the second kind can be characterized as\nthe coefficients involved in the corresponding change of basis matrix,\ni.e. $$x^n = \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k) x^{{\\underline{k}}}.$$ So, for example,\n$$x^4 = x + 7x(x-1) + 6x(x-1)(x-2) + x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3).$$\n\nArguing inductively, let us prove that this characterization follows\nfrom the recurrence relation. Evidently the formula is true for $n=1$.\nSuppose then that the formula is true for a given $n$. We have\n$$x x^{{\\underline{k}}}= x^{\\underline{k+1}} + k x^{{\\underline{k}}},$$\nand hence using the recurrence relation we deduce that $$\\begin{aligned}\nx^{n+1} &= \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)\\,x\\,x^{{\\underline{k}}}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^n {\\left(}kS(n,k) x^{{\\underline{k}}}+ S(n,k+1){\\right)}x^{\\underline{k+1}} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} S(n,k) x^{{\\underline{k}}}\\end{aligned}$$\n\n#### Differential operators.\n\nLet $D_x$ denote the ordinary derivative, applied to polynomials in\nindeterminate $x$, and let $T_x$ denote the differential operator\n$xD_x$. We have the following characterization of the Stirling numbers\nof the second kind in terms of these two operators:\n$$(T_x)^n = \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)\\, x^k (D_x)^k,$$ where an exponentiated\ndifferential operator denotes the operator composed with itself the\nindicated number of times. Let us show that this follows from the\nrecurrence relation. The proof is once again, inductive. Suppose that\nthe characterization is true for a given $n$. We have\n$$T_x(x^k (D_x)^k) =  k x^k (D_x)^k + x^{k+1} (D_x)^{k+1},$$ and hence\nusing the recurrence relation we deduce that $$\\begin{aligned}\n(T_x)^{n+1} &= xD_x{\\left(}\\sum_{k=1}^n  S(n,k)\\, x^k (D_x)^k {\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k) {\\left(}k x^k (D_x)^k + x^{k+1} (D_x)^{k+1}{\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}  S(n+1,k)\\, x^k (D_x)^k\\end{aligned}$$\n\n#### Double index generating function.\n\nOne can also characterize the Stirling numbers of the second kind in\nterms of the following generating function:\n$$e^{x(e^t-1)} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)\\,\nx^k\\,\\frac{t^n}{n!}.$$ Let us now prove this. Note that the differential\nequation $$\\frac{d\\xi}{dt} = \\xi,$$ admits the general solution\n$$\\xi = e^t x.$$ It follows that for any polynomial $p(\\xi)$ we have\n$$\\exp(t T_\\xi)[p(\\xi)]\\Big|_{\\xi=x} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n!}\n(T_\\xi)^n[p(\\xi)]\\Big|_{\\xi=x} = p(e^t x).$$ The proof is simple: just\ntake $D_t$ of both sides. To be more explicit,\n$$D_t{\\left[}p(e^t x) {\\right]}= p'(e^t x) e^t x =\nT_\\xi[p(\\xi)]\\Big|_{\\xi=xe^t},$$ and that is exactly equal to $D_t$ of\nthe left-hand side. Since this relation holds for all polynomials, it\nalso holds for all formal power series. In particular if we apply the\nabove relation to $e^\\xi$, use the result of the preceding section, and\nnote that $$D_\\xi[e^\\xi] = e^\\xi,$$ we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\ne^{xe^t} &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n!} (T_\\xi)^n[e^\\xi] \\Big|_{\\xi=x} \\\\\n&=  \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)\\, \\frac{t^n}{n!} \\xi^k\n(D_\\xi)^k[e^\\xi] \\Big|_{\\xi=x} \\\\\n&=  e^x \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^n S(n,k)\\, x^k\\, \\frac{t^n}{n!}\\\\\\end{aligned}$$\nDividing both sides by $e^x$ we obtain the desired generating function.\nQ.E.D.",
