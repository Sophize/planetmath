  "definition": "A graph $G$ is *Hamiltonian* if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nA useful condition both necessary and sufficient for a graph to be\nHamiltonian is not known. Ore\u2019s theorem and the Bondy and Chv\u00e1tal\ntheorem give sufficient conditions, while a necessary condition follows\nquickly from the definition, namely:\n\nLet $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of order at least 3. If $G$ is Hamiltonian,\nthen for every proper subset $U$ of $V$, the subgraph induced by $V-U$\nhas at most $|U|$ components.",
