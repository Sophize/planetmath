  "definition": "We shall define what a graph homomorphism is between two pseudographs,\nso that a graph homomorphism between two multigraphs, or two graphs are\nspecial cases.\n\nRecall that a pseudograph $G$ is an ordered triple $(V,E,i)$, where $V$\nis a set called the vertex set of $G$, $E$ is a set called the edge set\nof $G$, and $i:E\\to 2^V$ is a map (incidence map), such that for every\n$e\\in E$, $1\\le |i(e)|\\le 2$.\n\nElements of $V$ are called vertices, elements of $E$ edges. The\nvertex/vertices associated with any edge $e$ via the map $i$ is/are\ncalled the endpoint(s) of $e$. If an edge $e$ has only one endpoint, it\nis called a loop. $e_1$ and $e_2$ are said to be parallel if\n$i(e_1)=i(e_2)$.\n\nAs two examples, a multigraph is a pseudograph such that $|i(e)|=2$ for\neach edge $e\\in E$ (no loops allowed). A graph is a multigraph such that\n$i$ is one-to-one (no parallel edges allowed).\n\n**Definition**. Given two pseudographs $G_1=(V_1,E_1,i_1)$ and\n$G_2=(V_2,E_2,i_2)$, a *graph homomorphism* $h$ from $G_1$ to $G_2$\nconsists of two functions $f:V_1\\to V_2$ and $g:E_1\\to E_2$, such that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ni_2\\circ g=f^*\\circ i_1.\\end{aligned}$$ The function\n$f^*:2^{V_1} \\to 2^{V_2}$ is defined as\n$f^*(S)=\\lbrace f(s)\\mid s\\in S\\rbrace$.\n\nA *graph isomorphism* $h=(f,g)$ is a graph homomorphism such that both\n$f$ and $g$ are bijections. It is a *graph automorphism* if $G_1=G_2$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In case when $G_1$ and $G_2$ are graphs, a graph homomorphism may be\n    defined in terms of a single function $f:V_1\\to V_2$ satisfying the\n    condition (\\*)\n\n    $\\lbrace v_1,v_2\\rbrace$ is an edge of\n    $G_1\\Longrightarrow \\lbrace f(v_1),f(v_2)\\rbrace$ is an edge of\n    $G_2$.\n\n    To see this, suppose $h=(f,g)$ is a graph homomorphism from $G_1$ to\n    $G_2$. Then\n    $f^*i_1(e)=f^*(\\lbrace v_1,v_2\\rbrace)=\\lbrace f(v_1),f(v_2)\\rbrace=i_2(g(e))$.\n    The last equation says that $f(v_1)$ and $f(v_2)$ are endpoints of\n    $g(e)$. Conversely, suppose $f:V_1\\to V_2$ is a function sastisfying\n    condition (\\*). For each $e\\in E_1$ with end points\n    $\\lbrace v_1,v_2\\rbrace$, let $e^{\\prime}\\in E_2$ be the edge whose\n    endpoints are $\\lbrace f(v_1),f(v_2)\\rbrace$. There is only one such\n    edge because $G_2$ is a graph, having no parallel edges. Define\n    $g:E_1\\to E_2$ by $g(e)=e^{\\prime}$. Then $g$ is a well-defined\n    function which also satisfies Equation (1). So $h:=(f,g)$ is a graph\n    homomorphism $G_1\\to G_2$.\n\n-   The definition of a graph homomorphism between pseudographs can be\n    analogously applied to one between directed pseudographs. Since the\n    incidence map $i$ now maps each edge to an ordered pair of vertices,\n    a graph homomorphism thus defined will respect the \u201cdirection\u201d of\n    each edge. For example, $$\\xymatrix{a \\ar[r] & b\\ar[d] \\\\ \n    c \\ar[u] & d\\ar[l]}\n    \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\n    \\xymatrix{r \\ar[r] & s \\\\ \n    t \\ar[u]\\ar[r] & u\\ar[u]}$$ are two non-isomorphic digraphs whose\n    underlying graphs are isomorphic. Note that one digraph is strongly\n    connected, while the other is only weakly connected.",
