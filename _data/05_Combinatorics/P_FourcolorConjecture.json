  "statement": "The four-color conjecture was a long-standing problem posed by Francis\nGuthrie to his professor Augustus De Morgan in 1852, while coloring a\nmap of England. The conjecture states that every map on a plane or a\nsphere can be colored using only four colors such that no two adjacent\ncountries are assigned the same color. There are maps that need four\ncolors to be colored as the figure below shows. This conjecture\nequivalent to the statement that chromatic number of every planar graph\nis no more than four.\n\n(20pt,20pt)(180pt,180pt)\n\nAfter many unsuccessful attempts the conjecture was proven by Appel and\nHaken in 1976 with the aid of a computer. Before it was known that every\nplanar map can be five-colored by the work of Heawood in 1890.\n\nInterestingly, the seemingly harder problem of determining the maximal\nnumber of colors needed for all surfaces other than the sphere was\nsolved long before the four-color conjecture was settled. This is the\nHeawood number of the surface unless the surface is the Klein bottle in\nwhich case it is $6$.\n\n[1]{}\n\nKenneth\u00a0O. May.
