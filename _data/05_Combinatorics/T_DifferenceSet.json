  "definition": "**Definition**. Let $A$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$. A subset\n$D$ of $A$ is said to be a *difference set* (in $A$) if there is a\npositive integer $m$ such that every non-zero element of $A$ can be\nexpressed as the difference of elements of $D$ in exactly $m$ ways.\n\nIf $D$ has $d$ elements, then we have the equation $$m(n-1)=d(d-1).$$ In\nthe equation, we are counting the number of pairs of distinct elements\nof $D$. On the left hand side, we are counting it by noting that there\nare $m(n-1)$ pairs of elements of $D$ such that their difference is\nnon-zero. On the right hand side, we first count the number of elements\nin $D^2$, which is $d^2$, then subtracted by $d$, since there are $d$\npairs of $(x,y)\\in D^2$ such that $x=y$.\n\nA difference set with parameters $n,m,d$ defined above is also called a\n$(n,d,m)$-difference set. A difference set is said to be *non-trivial*\nif $1<d <n-1$. A difference set is said to be *planar* if $m=1$.\n\n**Difference sets versus square designs**. Recall that a square design\nis a $\\tau$-$(\\nu,\\kappa,\\lambda)$- where $\\tau=2$ and the number $\\nu$\nof points is the same as the number $b$ of blocks. In a general design,\n$b$ is related to the other numbers by the equation\n$$b\\binom{\\kappa}{\\tau}=\\lambda\\binom{\\nu}{\\tau}.$$ So in a square\ndesign, the equation reduces to $b\\kappa(\\kappa-1)=\\lambda\\nu(\\nu-1)$,\nor $$\\lambda(\\nu-1)=\\kappa(\\kappa-1),$$ which is identical to the\nequation above for the difference set. A square design with parameters\n$\\lambda,\\nu,\\kappa$ is called a square $(\\nu,\\kappa,\\lambda)$-design.\n\nOne can show that a subset $D$ of an abelian group $A$ is an\n$(n,d,m)$-difference set iff it is a square $(n,d,m)$-design where $A$\nis the set of points and $\\lbrace D+a\\mid a\\in A\\rbrace$ is the set of\nblocks.",
