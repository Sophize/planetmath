  "definition": "A *rooted tree* is a pair $(T,v)$, where $T$ is a tree and $v$ is a\nvertex of $T$ called the *root* of $T$. For example, the following\ndiagram represents a rooted tree with root $k$\n$$\\pstree[treemode=U,radius=3pt,levelsep=7ex]\n{\\Tc{3pt}~[tnpos=b,tndepth=0pt,radius=4pt]{$k$}}\n{\n\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=l]{$i$}}\n{\n\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=l]{$e$}}\n{\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$a$}}\n\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$f$}}\n\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$j$}}\n{\\TC~[tnpos=l]{$g$}\n\\pstree{\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$h$}}\n{\\TC~[tnpos=l]{$b$}\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$c$}\\TC~[tnpos=r]{$d$}}\n}\n}$$\n\nAny rooted tree $T$ has a natural partial ordering defined on its vertex\nset $V(T)$. Let $rt(T)$ be the root of $T$. For any pair of vertices\n$x,y$ of $T$, we define $x\\le y$ if $x$ is on the path from $rt(T)$ to\n$y$. It is easy to see that $\\le$ is a partial order on $V(T)$, and\n$rt(T)$ is the unique minimum element.\n\nGiven a vertex $v$, a *parent* of $v$ is a vertex $w$ that is covered by\n$v$. In other words, $w< v$ and if $w\\le w'< v$, then $w'= w$. Since the\npath connecting $rt(T)$ to $v$ is unique, the parent of a vertex is\nalways unique. In the example above, vertex $i$ is the parent of\nvertices $e$ and $f$. The root $rt(T)$ has no parent.\n\nA *child* of a vertex $v$ is a vertex $u$ that covers $v$. In other\nwords, $v< u$, and if $v< u' \\le u$, then $u'=u$. Again, from the tree\nabove, vertices $b,c$, and $d$ are children of vertex $h$. A vertex that\nis maximal with respect to $\\le$ is called a *leaf*. A leaf has no\nchildren. Vertices $a,b,c,d$ above are leaves. In addition, $u$ is the\nparent of $v$ iff $v$ is a child of $u$. It is possible for a vertex to\nhave neither children nor a parent (consider the linear ordering on the\nnon-negative reals).\n\nIt is easy to see that every path on a rooted tree is a linear ordering,\nor a chain. A *branch* of a rooted tree is a maximal chain. For example,\nthe path $a,e,i,k$ is a branch. Every branch of $T$ has at least one\nend-point: $rt(T)$. If it has another end point, that point must be a\nleaf. Every vertex lies on a unique branch. If each path of a rooted\ntree $T$ is in addition well-ordered, then $T$ is tree in the sense of\nset theory.\n\nA subtree $T'$ of a rooted tree $T$ need not have a root, and even if it\nis rooted, its root may not be the same as the root of $T$.\n\nGiven a rooted tree $T$, if take the disjoint union of $V(T)$ and\n$\\lbrace x\\rbrace$, and add $\\lbrace rt(T),x\\rbrace$ to the edge set of\n$T$, then we obtain another rooted tree $T'$ whose root is $x$. This\nconstruction can be generalized: if $T_i$ are rooted trees indexed by\n$i\\in I$, then we can take the disjoint union of their vertex sets\n$V(T_i)$, together with a singleton $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ (disjoint union\nhere as well). Next, add the set\n$\\lbrace \\lbrace rt(T_i),x\\rbrace \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ to the disjoing\nunion of the edge sets $E(T_i)$. What we have is a rooted tree with root\n$x$. This rooted tree is denoted by $\\bigoplus T_i$.\n\nA *labeled rooted tree* is a rooted tree where there is a function\n$f: V(T)\\to L$. In other words, each vertex $v$ has a label\n$f(v) \\in L$.",
