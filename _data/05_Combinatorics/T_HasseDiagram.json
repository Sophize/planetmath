  "definition": "If $(A,\\leq)$ is a finite poset, then it can be represented by a *Hasse\ndiagram*, which is a graph whose vertices are elements of $A$ and the\nedges correspond to the covering relation. More precisely an edge from\n$x\\in A$ to $y\\in A$ is present if\n\n-   $x < y$.\n\n-   There is no $z \\in A$ such that $x < z$ and $z < y$. (There are no\n    in-between elements.)\n\nIf $x<y$, then in $y$ is drawn higher than $x$. Because of that, the\ndirection of the edges is never indicated in a Hasse diagram.\n\n*Example:* If $A = \\mathcal{P}(\\{1,2,3\\})$, the power set of\n$\\{1,2,3\\}$, and $\\leq$ is the subset relation $\\subseteq$, then Hasse\ndiagram is $$\\xymatrix{\n                               & \\{1,2,3\\} &    \\\\\n\\{1,2\\} \\ar@{-}[ur]  & \\{1,3\\} \\ar@{-}[u]  & \\{2,3\\} \\ar@{-}[ul] \\\\\n\\{1\\} \\ar@{-}[u] \\ar@{-}[ur] & \\{2\\} \\ar@{-}[ul] \\ar@{-}[ur] & \\{3\\} \\ar@{-}[ul] \\ar@{-}[u] \\\\\n  & \\emptyset \\ar@{-}[ul] \\ar@{-}[u] \\ar@{-}[ur] & }$$\n\nEven though $\\{3\\} < \\{1,2,3\\}$ (since $\\{3\\} \\subset \\{1,2,3\\}$), there\nis no edge directly between them because there are inbetween elements:\n$\\{2,3\\}$ and $\\{1,3\\}$. However, there still remains an indirect path\nfrom $\\{3\\}$ to $\\{1,2,3\\}$.",
