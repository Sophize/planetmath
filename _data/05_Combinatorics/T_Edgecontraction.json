  "definition": "Given an edge $xy$ of a graph $G$, the graph $G/xy$ is obtained from $G$\nby *contracting* the edge $xy$; that is, to get $G/xy$ we identify the\nvertices $x$ and $y$ and remove all loops and duplicate edges. A graph\n$G'$ obtained by a sequence of edge-contractions is said to be a\n*contraction* of $G$.",
