  "definition": "Incidence geometry is essentially geometry based on the first postulate\nin Euclid\u2019s *The Elements*. Basically, the first postulate states that\nwe can draw a straight line from one point to another point. At the end\nof the 19th century, David Hilbert extended and axiomatized this\npostulate by adding several companion \u201cincidence axioms\u201d in his famous\n\u201cGrundlagen der Geometrie\u201d (). Since Hilbert\u2019s publication, his axioms\nof incidence have been characterized by alternative but versions, as\nwell as generalized as to include areas of interests from other branches\nof mathematics, especially, in combinatorics. In this entry, we will\ndefine incidence geometry using abstract notions of sets, functions, and\nrelations (specifically, an incidence relation) and then briefly discuss\nhow this definition is related to the axioms of incidence that we know\nfrom high school and college.\\\n\\\n**Definition**. Let $P$ be a set and $n$ a positive integer. An\n*incidence geometry* on $P$ consists of\n\n-   an onto function $t\\colon P\\to\\lbrace0,1,\\ldots,n\\rbrace$ called a\n    *type function*. If we define $P_i:=t^{-1}(i)$, then $P$ can be\n    partitioned into a finite number of subsets:\n\n    $$P=P_0\\cup\\cdots\\cup P_n,\\mbox{ with }P_i\\cap P_j=\\varnothing\\mbox{ for }i\\neq j.$$\n\n    Elements of $P_i$ are variously known as *blocks* or *varieties* of\n    *type $i$*. Sometimes, they are also called *flats* of *dimension\n    $i$*. For this discussion, we will use the latter terminology. Flats\n    of specific dimensions have further conditions:\n\n    1.  $P_0\\neq\\varnothing$. Flats of dimension 0 are called\n        ***points***.\n\n    2.  $P_n\\neq\\varnothing$ and consists of one element $S$, called the\n        *space*.\n\n-   a and symmetric relation $I\\subseteq P\\times P$ on $P$, called an\n    *incidence relation*, with the following conditions (or axioms):\n\n    1.  for any $a,b$ such that $(a,b)\\in I$ and $t(a)=t(b)$, then\n        $a=b$;\n\n    2.  suppose $t(a)\\leq t(b)\\leq t(c)$ with $(a,b)\\in I$ and\n        $(b,c)\\in I$, then $(a,c)\\in I$;\n\n    3.  given that $t(a)<n$, there is a point $p$ such that\n        $(p,a)\\notin I$;\n\n    4.  given $t(a)<n$ and a point $p$ with $(p,a)\\notin I$, there is a\n        unique $b$ with $t(b)=t(a)+1$, such that $(a,b)\\in I$ and\n        $(p,b)\\in I$; furthermore, if, in addition, there is a $c$ such\n        that $(p,c)\\in I$ and $(a,c)\\in I$, then $(b,c)\\in I$ as well;\n\n    5.  given that $t(a)>0$, there is a pair of a point $p$ and a flat\n        $b$, with $t(b)=t(a)-1$ and $(p,b)\\notin I$, such that\n        $(b,a)\\in I$ and $(p,a)\\in I$;\n\n    6.  given that $0<t(a)=t(b)=i<n$, a point $p$ with\n        $(p,a),(p,b)\\in I$, and a flat $d$ with $t(d)=i+1$,\n        $(a,d),(b,d)\\in I$, then there is a $c$ with $t(c)=i-1$ such\n        that $(a,c),(b,c)\\in I$.\n\nAn incidence geometry is often written as a triple $(P,n,I)$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Flats of dimensions 1 and 2 are commonly called ***lines*** and\n    ***planes***, respectively. Flats of dimension $n-1$ are called\n    *hyperplanes*.\n\n-   When $(a,b)\\in I$, we say that $a$ is *incident* with $b$. Since $I$\n    is symmetric, we also say that $a$ and $b$ are incident without any\n    ambiguity. Furthermore, if $a$ and $b$ are incident with\n    $t(a)\\leq t(b)$, then we say that $a$ ***lies on*** $b$, or $b$\n    ***passes through*** $a$.\n\n-   Condition 2 is known as the \u201cweak\u201d , or the \u201ctransversality\u201d of $I$.\n    Basically, $(a,b)\\in I$ and $(b,c)\\in I$ imply $(a,c)\\in I$ whenever\n    the dimensions of $a,b$ and $c$ are in a non-decreasing order.\n\n-   From Conditions 4 and 5 above, given any flat $a$ of dimension\n    $i>0$, there exist a point $p$ and a flat $b$ of dimension $i-1$\n    with the properties that\n\n    1.  $p$ is not incident with $b$,\n\n    2.  $a$ is incident with $p$, and\n\n    3.  $a$ is incident with $b$,\n\n    then the unique flat of dimension $i$ mentioned in Condition 4 is\n    $a$. We say that $a$ is *generated by* $p$ and $b$, or that $p$ and\n    $b$ generate $a$, and we write $a=\\langle p, b\\rangle$. When $b$ is\n    a point, $a$ is often written as $\\overleftrightarrow{pb}$. In\n    addition, if we were to pick a different pair of a point\n    $p^{\\prime}$ and a flat $b^{\\prime}$ of dimension $i-1$ satisfying\n    the above three properties, then\n    $a=\\langle p^{\\prime},b^{\\prime}\\rangle$ as well.\n\n-   From the second part of Condition 4, $\\langle p,b\\rangle$ is, in a\n    sense, the smallest block (in terms of its type number), such that\n    the above three properties hold. In other words, for any block $a$\n    with $(p,a)\\in I$ and $(b,a)\\in I$, then\n    $(\\langle p,b\\rangle,a)\\in I$. It is easy to see that\n    $t(a)\\geq t(\\langle p,b\\rangle)$. For otherwise,\n    $t(a)<t(\\langle p,b\\rangle)$, which means $t(a)\\leq t(b)$. This\n    inequality together with $(p,a)\\in I$ and $(a,b)$ imply that\n    $(p,b)\\in I$, a contradiction.\n\n-   In Condition 6, if $a\\neq b$, then $c$ is necessarily incident with\n    $p$. Otherwise, $a=\\langle p,c\\rangle=b$. Also, without much\n    trouble, one can show that $d$ in the condition must be unique.\n\n-   $P_i\\neq\\varnothing$ for all $0\\leq i\\leq n$. In other words, there\n    exists at least one flat of every dimension. To see this, we first\n    observe that $P_0\\neq\\varnothing$, there is at least one point $p$.\n    With $p$, there is a point $q$ such that $(p,q)\\notin I$. Therefore,\n    there is a (unique) line $\\ell$ that is incident with both $p$ and\n    $q$. Continue this way until we reach $i=n$.\n\n-   Any flat of dimension $i$ is incident with at least $i+1$ points.\n\n-   Every flat is incident with at least one flat of every dimension. As\n    a result, the space $S$ is incident with every flat of every\n    dimension.\n\n**Shadow**. For any $a\\in P$, define\n$I(a)=\\lbrace b\\in P\\mid (a,b)\\in I\\rbrace$,\n$I^{-}(a)=\\lbrace b\\in I(a)\\mid t(b)\\leq t(a)\\rbrace$, and\n$I^{+}(a)=\\lbrace b\\in I(a)\\mid t(b)\\geq t(a)\\rbrace$. For specific type\n$k$, we also define\n$I_k(a)=\\lbrace b\\mid t(b)=k\\mbox{ and }(b,a)\\in I\\rbrace$. When $k=0$,\n$I_0(a)$, the set of all points incident with $a$, is referred to as the\n*shadow* of $a$. We have that $I_0(a)\\subseteq\nI^{-}(a)\\subseteq I(a)$. We also have\n$I^{-}(a)\\cap I^{+}(a)=I_{t(a)}(a)=\\lbrace a\\rbrace$.\\\n\\\n**Remark**. It is possible to show that $(a,b)\\in I$ if and only if\n$I_0(a)\\subseteq I_0(b)$ or $I_0(b)\\subseteq I_0(a)$. Furthermore, if\n$I_0(a)\\subseteq I_0(b)$, then $t(a)\\leq t(b)$. In particular, $a=b$ if\nand only if $I_0(a)=I_0(b)$. From the last remark above, $I(S)=P$, and\nin particular $P_k=I_k(S)\\subset I(S)$. We also have for any flat $a$,\n$I_0(a)\\subseteq I_0(S)$. This says that every singleton subset of\n$I_0(S)$ is of the form $I_0(p)$ for some $p$. The discussion so far\nsuggests the following simpler, more intuitive, formulation of incidence\ngeometry:\\\n\\\nLet $A$ be a set. An incidence geometry on $A$ is a subset $P$ of the\npower set of $A$ such that $P$ can be partitioned into $n+1$ finite\nsubsets $P_0,\\ldots,P_n$ with the following *axioms*:\n\n1.  $P_0$ consists of all singleton subsets of $A$ and $P_0$ is\n    non-empty; elements of $P_0$ are called points of $A$. Since there\n    is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between $A$ and $P_0$, we\n    shall follow by convention and call elements of $A$ points of $A$\n    instead;\n\n2.  $P_n=\\lbrace A\\rbrace$; $A$ is called the space;\n\n3.  for every element $a$ of $P_i$, where $i<n$, there is a point $p$\n    such that $p\\notin a$;\n\n4.  for every $a\\in P_i$, where $i<n$, and point $p$ such that\n    $p\\notin A$, there is a unique $b\\in P_{i+1}$ such that $a\\subset b$\n    and $p\\in b$; furthermore, if there is a $c$ with $a\\subset c$ and\n    $p\\in c$, then $b\\subseteq c$;\n\n5.  for every $a\\in P_i$, where $i>0$, then there is a point $p$ and a\n    $b\\in P_{i-1}$ with $p\\notin b$, such that $p\\in a$ and\n    $b\\subset a$;\n\n6.  if $a,b\\in P_i$ and $d\\in P_{i+1}$, where $0<i<n$, with a point $p$\n    such that $p\\in a\\subset d$ and $p\\in b\\subset d$, then there is a\n    $c\\in P_{i-1}$ such that $c\\subset a$ and $c\\subset b$.\n\nIf we define $I$ on $P$ to be $(a,b)\\in I$ if and only if there is a\nsymmetrized inclusion relation between $a$ and $b$ ($a\\subseteq b$ or\n$b\\subseteq a$), it is not hard to verify that $I$ is an incidence\nrelation on $P$.\\\n\\\n**Remarks**. Elements of $P_1$ are called lines of $A$ and elements of\n$P_2$ are called planes of $A$. Whenever $a,b\\in P$ such that\n$a\\subset b$, then we say that $a$ lies on $b$ or $b$ passes through\n$a$. Two special types of incidence geometries are worth mentioning:\n\n-   If $n=2$, an incidence geometry on $A$ is called a ***plane\n    incidence geometry***. In a plane incidence geometry, Axioms 1\n    through 3, 5 and first part of 4 are necessary. Axiom 2 says that\n    the space is *the* unique plane of $A$. Axiom 3 enumerates elements\n    of $P$. Axiom 4 is the heart of the incidence geometry; it says that\n    two distinct points lie on a unique line. Furthermore, Axiom 4,\n    together with Axiom 3, say that any line is a subset of the plane.\n    Second part of Axiom 4 is redundant in a plane incidence geometry.\n    If any element of $P$ that passes through two distinct points must\n    be either a line or the plane. If it is a line, it must be the\n    unique line determined by the two points, or the plane, which,\n    clearly includes the unique line. Axiom 5 says that there is only to\n    create lines (and the plane), namely, via Axiom 4. Axiom 6 is\n    trivial too (let $c=p$).\n\n-   If $n=3$, an incidence geometry on $A$ is called a ***solid\n    incidence geometry***. Axioms 1 through 3, 5, and the first part of\n    Axiom 4 here play the same role as they do in a plane incidence\n    geometry. First part of Axiom 4 also says that a line and a point\n    not lying on it determine a unique plane. The second part of Axiom 4\n    and Axiom 6 play an equally important role as the other Axioms.\n    Without the second part of Axiom 4, we would not be able to show,\n    for example, that given a plane $\\pi$ and a point $p$ lying on\n    $\\pi$, there is a line $\\ell$ lying on $\\pi$ but not passing through\n    $p$. Axiom 6 is decidedly non-trivial in solid incidence geometry.\n    It basically says that two planes passing through a common point\n    must pass through a line. Without it, it is possible to find an\n    example such that two planes \u201c*intersect*\u201d at exactly one point.\n\n-   Several familiar concepts concerning particular incidence properties\n    of flat can be defined: points are *collinear* if they lie on the\n    same line; points and lines are *coplanar* if they lie on the same\n    plane; a *pencil* is a collection of flats of the same dimension\n    sharing a common incidence property which, in most cases, states\n    they have the same \u201cintersection\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of intersections, it would be proper to formally define what it\nmeans for two hyperplanes to \u201cintersect\u201d.\\\n\\\n**Intersection**. Let $a,b\\in P$. An *intersection* of $a$ and $b$ is a\nflat $c$, if it exists, such that $I_0(c)=I_0(a)\\cap I_0(b)$.\\\n\\\nImmediately, we see that, if an intersection of $a$ and $b$ exists, it\nmust be unique. For if $I_0(c)=I_0(a)\\cap I_0(b)=I_0(d)$, then $c=d$. We\nshall abuse the use of set-theoretic intersection to mean incidental\nintersection: if $a$ and $b$ are two flats, then $a\\cap b$ denotes their\nintersection. Furthermore, if no intersection exists, we write\n$a\\cap b=\\varnothing$.\\\n\\\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   It is easy to show that if $a$ and $b$ be flats with\n    $i=t(a)\\le t(b)$ and $a\\cap b=d\\ne \\varnothing$, then $(d,a)\\in I$\n    and $(d,b)\\in I$. In addition, if $(a,b)\\in I$, then $a=d$. Also,\n    the unique $c$ in Condition 6 above is the intersection or $a$ and\n    $b$.\n\n-   In light of the introduction of the concept of the intersection (of\n    two flats), it seems feasible to toss in an additional element,\n    called the *empty block* or *empty flat*, $\\varnothing$, into the\n    underlying set $P$ of the incidence geometry:\n    $P_{-1}:=\\lbrace \\varnothing\\rbrace$ and $P^{\\prime}=P_{-1}\\cup P$.\n    If we next define a binary relation $I^{\\prime}$ on $P^{\\prime}$ to\n    be:\n    $$(a,b)\\in I^{\\prime}\\textrm{ if }\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} (a,b)\\in I,\\\\ a=\\varnothing\\textrm{, or} \\\\ b=\\varnothing. \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ then $I^{\\prime}$ becomes an incidence relation on\n    $P^{\\prime}$ if we restrict flat $a$ in Condition 3 to be non-empty\n    only. Furthermore, $P^{\\prime}$, together with $I^{\\prime}$ have\n    almost all the ingredients of being an incidence geometry, except\n    that the range of the type function has now been extended to include\n    $-1$.\n\n-   For every pair of non-empty $a,b\\in P^{\\prime}$,\n    $U=I^{+}(a)\\cap I^{+}(b)$ is a non-empty set since the space $S$ is\n    in it. In addition, since $n$ is finite, $U$ has a minimal element\n    $c$ if we order its elements by their corresponding type numbers.\n    Moreover, $c$ is unique. We denote this $c$ by $\\langle a,b\\rangle$.\n    This definition is consistent with our earlier definition of\n    $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ when the first coordinate is a point\n    and the second coordinate is a flat not passing through the point.\n\n-   Collecting all the data above, it is now easy to see that\n    $P^{\\prime}$, together with the intersection operator $\\cap$, and\n    the angle bracket operator $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot \\rangle$ form a\n    semimodular lattice, if we set $a\\wedge b:=a\\cap b$ and\n    $a\\vee b:=\\langle a,b\\rangle$.\n\n-   ***parallelism***. Let $a$ be a flat. A flat $b$ is said be parallel\n    to $a$ if\n\n    1.  $t(b)=t(a)$,\n\n    2.  $a\\cap b$ is either $a$ or $\\varnothing$.\n\n    We write $a\\parallel b$. Note that if $a\\cap b=a$, then $a=b$, since\n    $t(b)=t(a)$. So if $a$ is parallel to $b$, $b$ is parallel to $a$,\n    and we may say that $a$ and $b$ are parallel. Parallelism is a\n    reflexive and symmetric relation. However, it is not (as in the case\n    of a hyperbolic geometry). Condition 6 above can now be restated as:\n    if two flats of dimensions $i$, both lying in a flat of dimension\n    $i+1$, are not parallel, then their intersection is a flat of\n    dimension $i-1$.\n\n-   An incidence geometry with the condition (or axiom) that every pair\n    of (non-empty) flats of dimensions $>0$ have non-empty intersection\n    is called a ***projective incidence geometry***.\n\n-   An incidence geometry with the condition (or axiom) that for every\n    (non-empty) flat $a$ of dimension $i$ with $i<n$, and any point $p$\n    not lying on $a$, there is a flat $b$ passing through $p$, such that\n    $a\\parallel b$, is called an ***affine incidence geometry***. The\n    condition just stated is known as the *Playfair\u2019s Axiom*.\n\nNote to reader: the historical background of this entry is weak.
