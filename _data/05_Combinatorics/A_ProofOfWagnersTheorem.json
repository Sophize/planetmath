  "argumentText": "It is sufficient to prove that the planarity condition given by Wagner\u2019s\ntheorem is equivalent to the one given by Kuratowski\u2019s theorem,\n[*i.e.*]{}, that a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $K_{5}$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a minor,\nif and only if it has a subgraph homeomorphic to either $K_{5}$ or\n$K_{3,3}$. It is not restrictive to suppose that $G$ is simple and\n2-connected.\n\nFirst, suppose that $G$ has a subgraph homeomorphic to either $K_{5}$ or\n$K_{3,3}$. Then there exists $U\\subseteq V$ such that the subgraph\ninduced by $U$ can be transformed into either $K_{5}$ or $K_{3,3}$ via a\nsequence of simple subdivisions and simple contractions through vertices\nof degree 2. Since none of these operations can alter the number of\nvertices of degree $d\\neq 2$, and neither $K_{5}$ nor $K_{3,3}$ have\nvertices of degree 2, none of the simple subdivisions is necessary, and\nthe homeomorphic subgraph is actually a minor.\n\nFor the other direction, we prove the following.\n\n1.  \\[item:k33\\] If $G$ has $K_{3,3}$ as a minor, then $G$ has a\n    subgraph homeomorphic to $K_{3,3}$.\n\n2.  \\[item:k5\\] If $G$ has $K_{5}$ as a minor, then $G$ has a subgraph\n    homeomorphic to either $K_{5}$ or $K_{3,3}$.\n\n*Proof of point\u00a0\\[item:k33\\]*\n\nIf $G$ has $K_{3,3}$ as a minor, then there exist\n$U_{1},U_{2},U_{3},W_{1},W_{2},W_{3}\\subseteq V$ that are pairwise\ndisjoint, induce connected subgraphs of $G$, and such that, for each $i$\nand $j$, there exist $u_{i,j}\\in U_{i}$ and $w_{i,j}\\in W_{j}$ such that\n$(u_{i,j},w_{i,j})\\in E$. Consequently, for each $i$, there exists a\nsubtree of $G$ with three leaves, one leaf in each of the $W_{j}$\u2019s, and\nall of its other nodes inside $U_{i}$; the situation with the $j$\u2019s is\nsymmetrical.\n\nAs a consequence of the handshake lemma, a tree with three leaves is\nhomeomorphic to $K_{1,3}$. Thus, $G$ has a subgraph homeomorphic to six\ncopies of $K_{1,3}$ connected three by three, [*i.e.*]{}, to $K_{3,3}$.\n\n*Proof of point\u00a0\\[item:k5\\]*\n\nIf $G$ has $K_{5}$ as a minor, then there exist pairwise disjoint\n$U_{1},\\ldots,U_{5}\\subseteq V$ that induce connected subgraphs of $G$\nand such that, for every $i\\neq j$, there exist $u_{i;\\{i,j\\}}\\in U_{i}$\nand $u_{j;\\{i,j\\}}\\in U_{j}$ such that\n$(u_{i;\\{i,j\\}},u_{j;\\{i,j\\}})\\in E$. Consequently, for each $i$, there\nexists a subtree $T_i$ of $G$ with four leaves, one leaf in each of the\n$U_{j}$\u2019s for $i\\neq j$, and with all of its other nodes inside $U_{i}$.\n\nAs a consequence of the handshake lemma, a tree with four leaves is\nhomeomorphic to either $K_{1,4}$ or two joint copies of $K_{1,3}$. If\nall of the trees above are homeomorphic to $K_{1,4}$, then $G$ has a\nsubgraph homeomorphic to five copies of $K_{1,4}$, each joint to the\nothers: [*i.e.*]{}, to $K_5$. Otherwise, a subgraph homeomorphic to\n$K_{3,3}$ can be obtained via the following procedure.\n\n1.  Choose one of the $T_i$\u2019s which is homeomorphic to two joint copies\n    of $K_{1,3}$, call them $T_{i,r}$ and $T_{i,b}$.\n\n2.  Color red the nodes of $T_{i,r}$, except its two leaves, which are\n    colored blue.\n\n3.  Color blue the nodes of $T_{i,b}$, except its two leaves, which are\n    colored red.\n\n4.  Color blue the nodes of the $T_j$\u2019s containing the leaves of\n    $T_{i,r}$.\n\n5.  Color red the nodes of the $T_j$\u2019s containing the leaves of\n    $T_{i,b}$.\n\n6.  Remove the edges joining nodes with same color in different\n    $T_j$\u2019s.\\\n    This \u201cprunes\u201d the $T_j$\u2019s so that they have three leaves, each in a\n    subgraph of a color different than the rest of their vertices.\n\nThe graph formed by the red and blue nodes, together with the remaining\nedges, is then isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$.\n\n[99]{}\n\nGeir Agnarsson, Raymond Greenlaw. *Graph Theory: Modeling, Applications\nand Algorithms.* Prentice Hall, 2006.",
