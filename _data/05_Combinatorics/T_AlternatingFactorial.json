  "definition": "The *alternating factorial* $af(n)$ of a positive integer $n$ is the sum\n$$af(n) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (-1)^{n - i}i!,$$ which can also be expressed\nwith the recurrence relation $af(n) = n! - af(n - 1)$ with starting\ncondition $af(1) = 1$. The notation n\u00c2\u00a1! (alternating an inverted\nexclamation mark with a regular exclamation mark) has been proposed by\nanalogy to that of the double factorial, but has not gained much\nsupport, in part because of TeX\u2019s lack of support for Spanish\ncharacters.\n\nThe first few alternating factorials, listed in A005165 of Sloane\u2019s\nOEIS, are 1, 5, 19, 101, 619, 4421.\n\nIn 1999, Miodrag Zivkovi\u0107 proved that $\\gcd(n, af(n)) = 1$ and that the\nset of alternating factorials that are prime numbers is finite.\n$af(661)$ is the largest such known prime.",
