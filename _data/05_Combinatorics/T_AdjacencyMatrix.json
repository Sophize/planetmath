The *adjacency\nmatrix* $M_G=(m_{ij})$ of $G$ is defined as follows: $M_G$ is an\n$n\\times n$ matrix such that $$m_{ij} = \\left \\lbrace\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\textrm{if $\\lbrace v_i,v_j\\rbrace \\in E$}\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.$$ In other words, start with the $n\\times n$ zero matrix, put a\n$1$ in $(i,j)$ if there is an edge whose endpoints are $v_i$ and $v_j$.\n\nFor example, the adjacency matrix of the following graph\n\nis\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\n**Remarks**. Let $G$ be a graph and $M_G$ be its adjacency matrix.\n\n-   $M_G$ is symmetric with $0$\u2019s in its main diagonal.\n\n-   The sum of the cells in any given column (or row) is the degree of\n    the corresponding vertex. Therefore, the sum of all the cells in\n    $M_G$ is twice the number of edges in $G$.\n\n-   $M_G=\\mathbf{1}-I$ iff $G$ is a complete graph. Here, $\\mathbf{1}$\n    is the matrix whose entries are all $1$ and $I$ is the identity\n    matrix.\n\n-   If we are given a symmetric matrix $M$ of order $n$ whose entries\n    are either $1$ or $0$ and whose entries in the main diagonal are all\n    $0$, then we can construct a graph $G$ such that $M=M_G$.\n\n### Generalizations {#generalizations .unnumbered}\n\nThe above definition of an adjacency matrix can be extended to\nmultigraphs (multiple edges between pairs of vertices allowed),\npseudographs (loops allowed), and even directed pseudographs (edges are\ndirectional). There are two cases in which we can generalize the\ndefinition, depending on whether edges are directional.\n\n1.  (Edges are not directional).\n\n    Since a multigraph is just a special case of a pseudograph, we will\n    define $M_G$ for a pseudograph $G$. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a pseudograph\n    with $V=\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ The *adjacency matrix*\n    $M_G=(m_{ij})$ of $G$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix such that $m_{ij}$ is\n    the number of edges whose endpoints are $v_i$ and $v_j$. Again,\n    $M_G$ is symmetric, but the main diagonal may contain non-zero\n    entries, in case there are loops.\n\n2.  (Edges are directional).\n\n    Since a digraph is a special case of a directed pseudograph, we\n    again define $M_G$ in the most general setting. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a\n    directed pseudograph with $V=\\lbrace v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\rbrace$ and\n    $E\\subseteq V\\times V\\times (\\mathbb{N}\\cup \\lbrace 0\\rbrace)$. The\n    *adjacency matrix* $M_G$ of $G$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix such that\n    $$m_{ij}=|\\lbrace k\\mid (v_i,v_j,k)\\in E\\rbrace|.$$ In other words,\n    $m_{ij}$ is the number of directed edges from $v_i$ to $v_j$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   If $G$ is a multigraph, then the entries in the main diagonal of\n    $M_G$ must be all $0$.\n\n-   If $G$ is a graph, then $M_G$ corresponds to the original definition\n    given in the previous section.\n\n-   If $G$ is a digraph, then entries $M_G$ consists of $0$\u2019s and $1$\u2019s\n    and its main diagonal consists of all $0$\u2019s.\n\n-   Given *any* square matrix $M$, there is a directed pseudograph $G$\n    with $M=M_G$. In addition, $M$ corresponds to adjacency matrix of\n    various types of graphs if appropriate conditions are imposed on $M$\n\n-   Generally, one can *derive* a pseudograph from a directed\n    pseudograph by \u201cforgetting\u201d the order in the ordered pairs of\n    vertices. If $G$ is a directed pseudograph and $G'$ is the\n    corresponding derived pseudograph. Let $M_G=(m_{ij})$ and\n    $M_{G'}=(n_{ij})$, then $n_{ij}=m_{ij}+m_{ji}$.\n\n    In the language of category theory, the above operation is done via\n    a forgetful functor (from the category of directed pseudographs to\n    the category of pseudographs). Other forgetful functors between\n    categories of various types of graphs are possible. In each case,\n    the forgetful functor has an associated operation on the adjacency\n    matrices of the graphs involved.",
