  "definition": "A matching on a bipartite graph is called a *bipartite matching*.\nBipartite matchings have many interesting properties.\n\n#### Matrix form\n\nSuppose we have a bipartite graph $G$ and we partition the vertices into\ntwo sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, of the same colour. We may then represent the\ngraph with a simplified adjacency matrix with $|V_1|$ rows and $|V_2|$\ncolumns containing a $1$ where an edge joins the corresponding vertices\nand a $0$ where there is no edge.\n\nWe say that two $1$s in the matrix are *line-independent* if they are\nnot in the same row or column. Then a matching on the graph with be a\nsubset of the $1$s in the matrix that are all line-independent.\n\nFor example, consider this bipartite graph (the thickened edges are a\nmatching):\n\n![image](bipartite3.eps)\n\nThe graph could be represented as the matrix $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1* & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1* & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1* \\\\\n0 & 1* & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ where a $1*$ indicates an edge in the matching. Note\nthat all the starred $1$s are line-independent.\n\nA *complete matching* on a bipartite graph $G(V_1, V_2, E)$ is one that\nsaturates all of the vertices in $V_1$.\n\n#### Systems of distinct representatives\n\nA system of distinct representatives is equivalent to a maximal matching\non some bipartite graph. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the two sets of vertices\nin the graph with $|V_1| \\leq |V_2|$. Consider the set\n$\\{ v \\in V_1 : \\Gamma(v) \\}$, which includes the neighborhood of every\nvertex in $V_1$. An SDR for this set will be a unique choice of an\nvertex in $V_2$ for each vertex in $V_1$. There must be an edge joining\nthese vertices; the set of all such edges forms a matching.\n\nConsider the sets $$\\begin{aligned}\nS_1 &=& \\{A, B, D\\} \\\\\nS_2 &=& \\{A,C \\} \\\\\nS_3 &=& \\{C,E \\} \\\\\nS_4 &=& \\{B,C,E \\} \\\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nOne SDR for these sets is $$\\begin{aligned}\nA &\\in& S_1 \\\\\nC &\\in& S_2 \\\\\nE &\\in& S_3 \\\\\nB &\\in& S_4 \\\\\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNote that this is the same matching on the graph shown above.\n\n#### Finding Bipartite Matchings\n\nOne method for finding maximal bipartite matchings involves using a\nnetwork flow algorithm. Before using it, however, we must modify the\ngraph.\n\nStart with a bipartite graph $G$. As usual, we consider the two sets of\nvertices $V_1$ and $V_2$. Replace every edge in the graph with a\ndirected arc from $V_1$ to $V_2$ of capacity $L$, where $L$ is some\nlarge integer.\n\nInvent two new vertices: the source and the sink. Add a directed arc of\ncapacity $1$ from the source to each vertex in $V_1$. Likewise, add a\ndirected arc of capacity $1$ from each vertex in $V_2$ to the sink.\n\nNow find the maximum flow from the source to the sink. The total weight\nof this flow will be the of the maximum matching on $G$. Similarly, the\nset of edges with non-zero flow will constitute a matching.\n\nThere also exist that avoid the overhead of setting up a weighted\ndigraph suitable for network flow.",
