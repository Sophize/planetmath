  "definition": "Let $G$ be a graph. An *edge covering* $C$ on $G$ is a subset of the\nvertices of $G$ such that each edge in $G$ is incident with at least one\nvertex in $C$.\n\nFor any graph, the vertex set is a trivial edge covering. Generally, we\nare more interested in *minimal coverings*. A minimal edge covering is\nsimply an edge covering of the least possible .",
