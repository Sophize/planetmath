  "definition": "The *birthday problem* is: What is the probability of two or more people\nout of a of $n$ do have the same birthday?\n\n*Solution.* Let $A$ be the event two or more people out of a group of\n$n$ to have the same birthday. It is easy to find first the complement\nof $A$, $A^c$, which is that no two people out of a group of $n$ will\nhave matching birthdays out of $365$ (number of days of one year)\nequally possible birthdays. We start with an arbitrary person\u2019s\nbirthday. So the second person\u2019s birthday in order to be different from\nthe first one gives us the probability, $1-\\frac{1}{365}$.\nConsecutively, the third person\u2019s birthday is different from the first\ntwo and we have $(1-\\frac{1}{365})(1-\\frac{2}{365})$. Finally for the\nthe $n$th person\u2019s birthday we get the probability\n\n  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  $\\displaystyle P[A^c]$   $\\displaystyle =\\left(1-\\frac{1}{365}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{2}{365}\\right)\\dots\\left(1-\\frac{n-1}{365}\\right)$\n                           $\\displaystyle =\\frac{(365-1)}{365}\\frac{(365-2)}{365}\\dots\\frac{(365-(n-1))}{365}$\n                           $\\displaystyle =\\frac{(365-1)}{365}\\dots \\frac{(365-(n-1))}{365^n}$\n                           $\\displaystyle =\\frac{365!}{(365-n)!365^n}$\n                           $\\displaystyle ={365\\choose n}\\frac{n!}{365^n}$\n  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy the last expression of the estimated probability we can see that\nthere exists another easier approach to find the probability which is\nthe following:\n\n1.  We set the possible ways for $1\\dots n$ birthdays, $365^n$ as the\n    denominator.\n\n2.  Using the binomial coefficient ${365\\choose n}$, which represents\n    the number of ways of picking $n$ unordered birthdays from $365$\n    days multiplied by the factorial $n!$ used for the number of orders,\n    in that way we determine the numerator.\n\nTherefore we have $$P[A^c]={365\\choose n}\\frac{n!}{365^n}$$ whence\n$$P[A]=1-P[A^c]=1-{365\\choose n}\\frac{n!}{365^n}.$$\n\nThe table below shows the probability $P[A]$ for some values of $n$\n\n   $n$     $P[A]$\n  ------ -----------\n   $10$   $0,11695$\n   $20$   $0,41144$\n   $23$   $0,50730$\n   $30$   $0,70632$\n   $40$   $0,89123$\n   $50$   $0,97037$",
