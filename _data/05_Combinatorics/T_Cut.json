  "definition": "On a digraph, define a *sink* to be a vertex with out-degree zero and a\n*source* to be a vertex with in-degree zero. Let $G$ be a digraph with\nnon-negative weights and with exactly one sink and exactly one source. A\n*cut* $C$ on $G$ is a subset of the edges such that every path from the\nsource to the sink passes through an edge in $C$. In other words, if we\nremove every edge in $C$ from the graph, there is no longer a path from\nthe source to the sink.\n\nDefine the weight of $C$ as $$W_C = \\sum_{e \\in C} W(e)$$ where $W(e)$\nis the weight of the edge $e$.\n\nObserve that we may achieve a trivial cut by removing all the edges of\n$G$. Typically, we are more interested in *minimal cuts*, where the\nweight of the cut is minimized for a particular graph.",
