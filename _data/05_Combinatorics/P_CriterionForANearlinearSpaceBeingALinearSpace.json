Then $$\\sum_{i=1}^b s_i(s_i-1) \\leq v(v-1),$$ and\nequality holds if and only if $\\mathscr{S}$ is a linear space.\n\n#### Proof\n\nLet $N$ be the number of ordered pairs of points that are joined by a\nline. Clearly $N$ can be no more than $v(v-1)$, and $N=v(v-1)$ if and\nonly if every pair of points are joined by a line. Since two points in a\nnear-linear space are on at most one line, we can label each pair by the\nline to which the two points belong to. We thus have a partition of the\n$N$ pairs into $b$ groups, and each group is associated with a distinct\nline. The group corresponding to the line consisting of $s_i$ points\ncontributes $s_i(s_i-1)$ to the total sum. Therefore\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^b s_i(s_i-1) = N \\leq v(v-1).$$",
