  "definition": "In graph theory, a *loop* is an edge which joins a vertex to itself,\nrather than to some other vertex. By definition, a graph cannot contain\na loop; a pseudograph, however, may contain both multiple edges and\nmultiple loops. Note that by some definitions, a multigraph may contain\nmultiple edges and no loops, while other texts define a multigraph as a\ngraph allowing multiple edges and multiple loops.\n\nIn algebra, a *loop* is a quasigroup which contains an identity element.",
