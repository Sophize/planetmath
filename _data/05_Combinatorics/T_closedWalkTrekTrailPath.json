  "definition": "Graph theory terminology is notoriously variable so the following\ndefinitions should be used with caution. In books, most authors define\ntheir usage at the beginning.\n\nIn a graph, multigraph or even pseudograph $G$,\n\n-   a [**walk**]{} of length $s$ is formed by a sequence of $s$ edges\n    such that any two successive edges in the sequence share a vertex\n    (aka node). The walk is also considered to include all the vertices\n    (nodes) incident to those edges, making it a subgraph.\n\n    In the case of a simple graph (i.e.\u00a0not a multigraph) it is also\n    possible to define the walk uniquely by the vertices it visits: a\n    [**walk**]{} of length $s$ is then a sequence of vertices $\\nu_0$,\n    $\\nu_1$, \u2026\u00a0$\\nu_s$ such that an edge $\\nu_i\\nu_{i+1}$ exists for all\n    $0\\le i\\lt s$. Again the walk is considered to contain those edges\n    as well as the vertices.\n\n-   A [**trek**]{} is a walk that does not backtrack, i.e.\u00a0 no two\n    successive edges are the same.\n\n    For simple graphs this also implies $\\nu_i \\ne \\nu_{i+2}$ for all\n    $0\\le i\\le s-2$.\n\n-   A [**trail**]{} is a walk where all edges are distinct, and\n\n-   a [**path**]{} is one where all vertices are distinct.\n\nThe walk, etc.\u00a0is said to [**run from $\\nu_0$ to $\\nu_s$**]{}, to [**run\nbetween**]{} them, to [**connect**]{} them etc. The term [*trek*]{} was\nintroduced by Cameron\u00a0[@Cam94] who notes the lexicographic mnemonic\n$$\\hbox{\\em paths\\/}  \\;\\subset\\;\n  \\hbox{\\em trails\\/} \\;\\subset\\;\n  \\hbox{\\em treks\\/}  \\;\\subset\\;\n  \\hbox{\\em walks\\/}$$ The other terms are fairly widespread,\ncf.\u00a0[@Wil02], but [**beware:**]{} many authors call walks [**paths**]{},\nand some then call paths [**chains**]{}. And when edges are called\n[**arcs**]{}, a trek of length $s$ sometimes goes by the name\n[**$s$-arc**]{}.\n\nNote that for the purpose of defining connectivity any of these types of\nwanderings can be used; if a walk exists between vertices $\\mu$ and\n$\\nu$ then there also exists a path between them. And here we must allow\n$s=0$ to make \u201care connected by a path\u201d an equivalence relation on\nvertices (in order to define connected components as its equivalence\nclasses).\n\n-   A [**closed walk**]{} aka [**circuit**]{} of length $s\\ne0$ is a\n    walk where $\\nu_0 = \\nu_s$,\n\n-   a [**closed trek**]{} is a trek that\u2019s closed in the same way, and\n\n-   a [**closed trail**]{} likewise;\n\n-   a [**closed path**]{} aka ([**elementary**]{}) [**cycle**]{} is like\n    a path (except that we only demand that $\\nu_i$ for $0\\le i\\lt s$\n    are distinct) and again closed ($\\nu_s$ again coincides with\n    $\\nu_0$).\n\n[**Beware:**]{} cycles are often called circuits\u00a0[@Cam94]; the\ndistinction between circuits and cycles here follows Wilson\u00a0[@Wil02].\nThese closed wanderings are often called after their length:\n[**$s$-circuits**]{}, [**$s$-cycles**]{}.\n\nThe case $s=0$ is excluded from these definitions; $1$-cycles are loops\nso imply a pseudograph; $2$-cycles are double edges implying\nmultigraphs; so $3$ is the minimum cycle length in a proper graph.\n\nNote also that in trivalent aka cubic graphs a closed trail is\nautomatically a closed path: it is impossible to visit a vertex (in via\nedge $a$, out via edge $b$ say) and visit it again (in via $c$, out via\n$d$) without also revisiting an edge, because there are only three edges\nat each vertex.\n\n-   An [**open walk**]{}, [**open trek**]{}, [**open trail**]{} is one\n    that isn\u2019t closed.\n\n-   An [**open path**]{} (sometimes [**open chain**]{}) is just a path\n    as defined above (because a closed path isn\u2019t actually a path).\n    Still, the term is useful when you want to emphasise the contrast\n    with a closed path.\n\n[MST73]{}\n\n,\\\nCamb.\u00a0Univ.\u00a0Pr.\u00a01994, ,\\\n(solutions, errata &c.)\n\n, ,\\\nOxford\u00a0Univ.\u00a0Pr.\u00a02002, (pbk),\\\n(errata &c.)",
