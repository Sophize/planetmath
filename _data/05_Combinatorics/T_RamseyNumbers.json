  "definition": "Define $R(a,b)$ to be the least integer $N$ such that, in any red-blue\n2-coloring of the edges of a $N$-vertex complete graph $K_N$, there must\nexist either an all-red $K_a$ or an all-blue $K_b$.\n\nFrank Ramsey proved these numbers always exist. He famously pointed out\nthat among any 6 people, some three are mutual friends or some three\nmutual non-friends. That is, $R(3,3)\\le 6$. Since a red pentagon with a\nblue pentagram drawn inside it has no monochromatic triangle,\n$R(3,3)\\ge 6$. So $R(3,3)=6$.\n\nSpecial attention is usually paid to the diagonal $R(k,k)$, which is\noften just written $R(k)$.\n\nOne can also generalize this in various ways, e.g. consider $R(a,b,c)$\nfor [*three*]{}-colorings of edges, etc (any number of arguments), and\nallow general sets of graphs, not just pairs of complete ones.\n\nRamsey numbers are very difficult to determine. To prove lower bounds,\nconstruct good edge-colorings of some $K_N$ and, use a clique-finder to\nfind the largest mono-colored cliques. To prove upper bounds, the main\ntool has been $R(a,b)\\le R(a-1,b)+R(b-1,a)$ which implies\n$R(a,b) \\le {{a+b-2} \\choose {a-1}}$ and then\n$R(k) \\le [1+o(1)] 4^k / (4 \\sqrt{\\pi k}$ when $k \\to \\infty$. From\nconsidering random colorings and using a probabilistic nonconstructive\nexistence argument, one may show\n$R(k) \\ge k 2^{k/2} [ o(1) + \\sqrt{2} / e ]$. It is known that $R(1)=1$,\n$R(2)=2$, $R(3)=6$, $R(4)=18$, and $43 \\le R(5) \\le 49$. For a survey of\nthe best upper and lower bounds available on small Ramsey numbers, see\n(). Another kind of Ramsey-like number which has not gotten as much\nattention as it deserves, are Ramsey numbers for [*directed*]{} graphs.\nLet $\\vec{R}(n)$ denote the least integer $N$ so that any tournament\n(complete directed graph with singly-directed arcs) with $\\ge N$\nvertices contains an acyclic (also called \u201ctransitive\u201d) $n$-node\ntournament. (Analogies: 2-color the edges $\\to$ two directions for arcs.\nMonochromatic $\\to$ acyclic, i.e. all arcs \u201cpoint one way.\u201d)\n\nAgain, to prove lower bounds, construct good tournaments and apply\nsomething like a clique-finder (but instead aimed at trying to find the\nlargest acyclic induced subgraph). To prove upper bounds, the main tool\nis $\\vec{R}(n+1) \\le 2 \\vec{R}(n)$. That can be used to show the upper\nbound, and random-orientation arguments combined with a nonconstructive\nprobabilistic existence argument show the lower bound, in\n$[1+o(1)] 2^{n+1)/2} \\le \\vec{R}(n) \\le 55 \\cdot 2^{n-7}$. It is known\nthat $\\vec{R}(1)=1$, $\\vec{R}(2)=2$, $\\vec{R}(3)=4$, $\\vec{R}(4)=8$,\n$\\vec{R}(5)=14$, $\\vec{R}(6)=28$, and $32 \\le \\vec{R}(7) \\le 55$.
