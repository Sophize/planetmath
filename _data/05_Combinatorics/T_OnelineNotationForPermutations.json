  "definition": "*One-line notation* is a system for representing permutations on a\ncollection of symbols by words over the alphabet consisting of those\nsymbols. First we show how the notation works in an example, and then we\nshow that the notation can be made to work for any symmetric group.\n\nFirst consider the permutation $\\pi = (134)(25)$ in the symmetric group\n$\\mathfrak{S}_5$. Here $\\pi$ is written in cycle notation, so\n$\\pi(1)=3$, $\\pi(2)=5$, $\\pi(3)=4$, $\\pi(4)=1$, and $\\pi(5)=2$. We can\nrecord this information in the following table:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{clllll}\ni      & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\pi(i) & 3 & 5 & 4 & 1 & 2 \n\\end{array}$$\n\nFinally, we read off the one-line notation as the second row of the\ntable. Thus we write $\\pi = 35412$.\n\nNow we define one-line notation for arbitrary finite symmetric groups.\nLet $X$ be a set of finite cardinality $n$ and let $\\mathfrak{S}_X$ be\nthe group of permutations on $X$. Fix once and for all a total order $<$\non $X$. Using this order, we may say that\n$$X=\\{ x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_n \\}.$$ For an arbitrary\n$\\pi\\in\\mathfrak{S}_X$, the one-line notation for $\\pi$ is then\n$$\\pi = \\pi(x_1) \\pi(x_2) \\cdots \\pi(x_n).$$ Observe that if $\\pi$ and\n$\\sigma$ are distinct permutations in $\\mathfrak{S}_X$, then there is\nsome $i$ for which $\\pi(x_i)\\ne\\sigma(x_i)$. Hence the one-line\nnotations for $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ will differ in the $i$th position. This\nshows that one-line notation is an injective map. Furthermore, we can\nimmediately recover $\\pi$ from its one-line notation. If $\\pi$ has\none-line notation $a_1 a_2 \\dots a_n$, then we know that\n$\\pi(x_i) = a_i$ for all $i$. For example, consider the permutation in\n$\\mathfrak{S}_7$ written in one-line notation as $\\pi=1732654$. We\nimmediately obtain the following: $$\\begin{array}{clllllll}\ni      & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\\\\n\\pi(i) & 1 & 7 & 3 & 2 & 6 & 5 & 4\n\\end{array}$$ So now we can translate the permutation into cycle\nnotation: $\\pi=(1)(274)(56)$.\n\nIf we are willing to allow words of infinite length, we can even extend\none-line notation to symmetric groups of arbitrary cardinality. Let $X$\nbe a set and $\\mathfrak{S}_X$ its symmetric group. Apply the axiom of\nchoice to select a well-ordering on $X$. So we may write the elements of\n$X$ in order as the tuple\n$(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{\\alpha}, x_{\\alpha+1}, \\dots)$. Then for each\n$\\pi\\in\\mathfrak{S}_X$ the one-line notation for $\\pi$ is the tuple\n$$(\\pi(x_1), \\pi(x_2), \\dots, \\pi(x_{\\alpha}), \\pi(x_{\\alpha+1}), \\dots).$$\nThe same analysis as in the finite case shows that a permutation is\nuniquely recoverable from its representation in one-line notation.",
