  "definition": "An (unordered) partition of a natural number $n$ is a way of writing $n$\nas a sum of natural numbers. For example, the following are the all\npartitions of $5$: $$\\begin{aligned}\n5&=5&5&=2+2+1\\\\\n5&=4+1&5&=2+1+1+1\\\\\n5&=3+2&5&=1+1+1+1+1\\\\\n5&=3+1+1\\end{aligned}$$ Conventionally, parts of a partition are written\nfrom the largest to the smallest. Instead of writing the partition as a\nsum, it is common to use the multiset notation, such as\n$\\{8,5,5,5,2,1,1\\}$ for $27=8+5+5+5+2+1+1$. Another common notation is\nto write multiplicities as superscripts, such as $1^22^15^38$ for\n$27=8+5+5+5+2+1+1$. Note that this way of writing partitions typically\nuses smallest to largest.\n\nPartitions are often drawn as *Young diagrams*, which are rectangular\narrays of boxes in which the $k$\u2019th row has a number of boxes equal to\nthe $k$\u2019th part of the partition. Sometimes dots are used instead of\nboxes, and then the obtained picture is called a *Ferrers diagram*. For\ninstance, the partition $10=5+2+2+1$ is drawn\n\nThe *dual partition* is the partition obtained by reflecting the Young\ndiagram along the main diagonal. For example, the Young diagram of the\npartition dual to the one above is\n\n[ =4 =5 =3 =5 =2 =5 =1 =5 =3 =4 =2 =4 =1 =4 =1 =3 =1 =2 =1 =1 ]{}\n\nwhich is the diagram of $10=4+3+1+1+1$.\n\n[1]{}\n\nRichard\u00a0P.
