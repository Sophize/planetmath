  "definition": "In the parent entry, we see how one may define dimension of a projective\nspace inductively, from its subspaces starting with a point, then a\nline, and working its way up. Another way to define dimension start with\ndefining dimensions of the empty set, a point, a line, and a plane to be\n$-1,0,1$, and $2$, and then use the fact that any other projective space\nis isomorphic to the projective space $P(V)$ associated with a vector\nspace $V$, and then define the dimension to be the dimension of $V$,\nminus $1$. In this entry, we introduce a more natural way of defining\ndimensions, via the concept of a basis.\n\nThroughout the discussion, $\\mathbf{P}$ is a projective space (as in any\nmodel satisfying the axioms of projective geometry).\n\nGiven a subset $S$ of $\\mathbf{P}$, the *span* of $S$, written\n$\\langle S \\rangle$, is the smallest subspace of $\\mathbf{P}$ containing\n$S$. In other words, $\\langle S\\rangle$ is the intersection of all\nsubspaces of $\\mathbf{P}$ containing $S$. Thus, if $S$ is itself a\nsubspace of $\\mathbf{P}$, $\\langle S\\rangle = S$. We also say that $S$\nspans $\\langle S\\rangle$.\n\nOne may think of $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ as an operation on the powerset\nof $\\mathbf{P}$. It is easy to verify that this operation is a closure\noperator. In addition, $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ is *algebraic*, in the\nsense that any point in $\\langle S\\rangle$ is in the span of a finite\nsubset of $S$. In other words,\n$$\\langle S\\rangle = \\lbrace P\\mid P\\in \\langle F\\rangle\\mbox{ for some finite }F\\subseteq S\\rbrace.$$\n\nAnother property of $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ is the exchange property:\nfor any subspace $U$, if $P\\notin U$, then for any point $Q$,\n$\\langle U\\cup \\lbrace P\\rbrace \\rangle = \\langle U\\cup \\lbrace Q\\rbrace \\rangle$\niff $Q\\in \\langle U\\cup \\lbrace P\\rbrace \\rangle - U$.\n\nA subset $S$ of $\\mathbf{P}$ is said to be *projectively independent*,\nor simply *independent*, if, for any proper subset $S'$ of $S$, the span\nof $S'$ is a proper subset of the span of $S$:\n$\\langle S'\\rangle \\subset \\langle S\\rangle$. This is the same as saying\nthat $S$ is a *minimal* spanning set for $\\langle S\\rangle$, in the\nsense that no proper subset of $S$ spans $\\langle S\\rangle$.\nEquivalently, $S$ is independent iff for any $x\\in S$,\n$\\langle S-\\lbrace x\\rbrace \\rangle \\ne \\langle S\\rangle$.\n\n$S$ is called a *projective basis*, or simply *basis* for $\\mathbf{P}$,\nif $S$ is independent and spans $\\mathbf{P}$.\n\nAll of the properties about spanning sets, independent sets, and bases\nfor vector spaces have their projective counterparts. We list some of\nthem here:\n\n1.  Every projective space has a basis.\n\n2.  If $S_1,S_2$ are independent, then\n    $\\langle S_1\\cap S_2\\rangle = \\langle S_1\\rangle \\cap \\langle S_2\\rangle$.\n\n3.  If $S$ is independent and $P\\in \\langle S\\rangle$, then there is\n    $Q\\in S$ such that $(\\lbrace P\\rbrace \\cup S)-\\lbrace Q\\rbrace $\n    spans $\\langle S\\rangle$.\n\n4.  Let $B$ be a basis for $\\mathbf{P}$. If $S$ spans $\\mathbf{P}$, then\n    $|B|\\le |S|$. If $S$ is independent, then $|S|\\le |B|$. As a result,\n    all bases for $\\mathbf{P}$ have the same cardinality.\n\n5.  Every independent subset in $\\mathbf{P}$ may be extended to a basis\n    for $\\mathbf{P}$.\n\n6.  Every spanning set for $\\mathbf{P}$ may be reduced to a basis for\n    $\\mathbf{P}$.\n\nIn light of items 1 and 4 above, we may define the *dimension* of\n$\\mathbf{P}$ to be the cardinality of its basis.\n\nOne of the main result on dimension is the dimension formula: if $U,V$\nare subspaces of $\\mathbf{P}$, then\n$$\\dim(U)+\\dim(V)=\\dim(U\\cup V)+\\dim(U\\cap V),$$ which is the\ncounterpart of the same formula for vector subspaces of a vector space\n(see ).\n\n[6]{} A.
