  "statement": "The original version of *Ramsey\u2019s theorem* states that for every\npositive integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ there is $n$ such that if edges of a\ncomplete graph on $n$ vertices are colored in two colors, then there is\neither a $k_1$-clique of the first color or $k_2$-clique of the second\ncolor.\n\nThe standard proof proceeds by induction on $k_1+k_2$. If\n$k_1,k_2\\leq 2$, then the theorem holds trivially. To prove induction\nstep we consider the graph $G$ that contains no cliques of the desired\nkind, and then consider any vertex $v$ of $G$. Partition the rest of the\nvertices into two classes $C_1$ and $C_2$ according to whether edges\nfrom $v$ are of color $1$ or $2$ respectively. By inductive hypothesis\n${\\left\\lvert C_1\\right\\rvert}$ is bounded since it contains no\n$k_1-1$-clique of color $1$ and no $k_2$-clique of color $2$. Similarly,\n${\\left\\lvert C_2\\right\\rvert}$ is bounded. QED.\n\nSimilar argument shows that for any positive integers\n$k_1,k_2,\\dotsc,k_t$ if we color the edges of a sufficiently large graph\nin $t$ colors, then we would be able to find either $k_1$-clique of\ncolor $1$, or $k_2$-clique or color $2$,\u2026, or $k_t$-clique of color $t$.\n\nThe minimum $n$ whose existence stated in Ramsey\u2019s theorem is called\n*Ramsey number* and denoted by $R(k_1,k_2)$ (and $R(k_1,k_2,\\dotsc,k_t)$\nfor multicolored graphs). The above proof shows that\n$R(k_1,k_2)\\leq R(k_1,k_2-1)+R(k_1-1,k_2)$. From that it is not hard to\ndeduce by induction that $R(k_1,k_2)\\leq\n\\binom{k_1+k_2-2}{k_1-1}$. In the most interesting case $k_1=k_2=k$ this\nyields approximately $R(k,k)\\leq (4+o(1))^k$. The lower bounds can be\nestablished by means of probabilistic construction as follows.\n\nTake a complete graph on $n$ vertices and color its edges at random,\nchoosing the color of each edge uniformly independently of all other\nedges. The probability that any given set of $k$ vertices is a\nmonochromatic clique is $2^{1-k}$. Let $I_r$ be the random variable\nwhich is $1$ if $r$\u2019th set of $k$ elements is monochromatic clique and\nis $0$ otherwise. The sum $I_r$\u2019s over all $k$-element sets is simply\nthe number of monochromatic $k$-cliques. Therefore by linearity of\nexpectation $E(\\sum I_r)=\\sum\nE(I_r)=2^{1-k}\\binom{n}{k}$. If the expectation is less than $1$, then\nthere exists a coloring which has no monochromatic cliques. A little\nexercise in calculus shows that if we choose $n$ to be no more than\n$(2+o(1))^{k/2}$ then the expectation is indeed less than $1$. Hence,\n$R(k,k)\\geq (\\sqrt{2}+o(1))^{k}$.\n\nThe gap between the lower and upper bounds has been for several decades.\nThere have been a number of improvements in $o(1)$ terms, but nothing\nbetter than $\\sqrt{2}+o(1)\\leq R(k,k)^{1/k}\\leq\n4+o(1)$ is known. It is not even known whether $\\lim_{k\\to \\infty}\nR(k,k)^{1/k}$ exists.\n\nThe behavior of $R(k,x)$ for fixed $k$ and large $x$ is equally\nmysterious. For this case Ajtai, Koml\u00f3s and Szemer\u00e9di[@cite:aks_ramsey]\nproved that $R(k,x)\\leq\nc_{k}x^{k-1}/(\\ln)^{k-2}$. The matching lower bound has only recently\nbeen established for $k=3$ by Kim [@cite:kim_ramsey_three]. Even in this\ncase the asymptotics is unknown. The combination of results of Kim and\nimprovement of Ajtai, Koml\u00f3s and Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s result by Shearer\n[@cite:shearer_independence] yields\n$\\tfrac{1}{162}(1+o(1)) k^2/\\log k \\leq R(3,k)\\leq (1+o(1))k^2/\\log k$.\n\nA lot of machine and human time has been spent trying to determine\nRamsey numbers for small $k_1$ and $k_2$.
