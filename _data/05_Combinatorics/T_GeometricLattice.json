  "definition": "A lattice is said to be *geometric* if it is\n\n1.  ,\n\n2.  , and\n\n3.  each compact element is a join of atoms.\n\nBy the definition of compactness, the last condition is equivalent to\n\u201ceach compact element is a finite join of atoms\u201d.\n\nThree examples that come to mind are\n\n-   the power set of a set;\n\n-   an incidence geometry with the empty set adjoined to form the bottom\n    element; and\n\n-   a projective geometry (the lattice of subspaces of a vector space).\n\nFrom the last two examples, one sees how the name \u201cgeometric\u201d lattice is\nderived.\n\nTo generate geometric lattices from existing ones, one has the following\n\nAny lattice interval of a geometric lattice is also geometric.\n\nLet $L$ be a geometric lattice and $I=[x,y]$ a lattice interval of $L$.\nWe first prove that $I$ is algebraic, that is, $I$ is both complete and\nthat every element is a join of compact elements. Since $L$ is complete,\nboth $\\bigvee S$ and $\\bigwedge S$ exist in $L$ for any subset\n$S\\subseteq L$. Since $x\\le s\\le y$ for each $s\\in S$, $\\bigvee S$ and\n$\\bigwedge S$ are in fact in $I$. So $I$ is a complete lattice.\n\nNow, suppose that $a\\in I$. Since $L$ is algebraic, $a$ is a join of\ncompact elements in $L$: $a=\\bigvee_i a_i$, where each $a_i$ is compact\nin $L$. Since $a_i\\le y$, the elements $b_i:=a_i\\vee x$ are in $I$ for\neach $i$. So\n$a=a\\vee x=(\\bigvee_i a_i)\\vee x=\\bigvee_i (a_i\\vee x)=\\bigvee_i b_i$.\nWe want to show that each $b_i$ is compact in $I$. Since $a_i$ is\ncompact in $L$, $a_i=\\bigvee_{k=1}^{m}\\alpha_k$, where $\\alpha_k$ are\natoms in $L$. Then\n$b_i=(\\bigvee_{k=1}^{m}\\alpha_k)\\vee x=\\bigvee_{k=1}^{m}(\\alpha_k\\vee x)$.\nLet $S$ be a subset of $I$ such that $\\alpha_k\\vee x\\le \\bigvee S$.\nSince $\\alpha_k\\le \\bigvee S$ and $\\alpha_k$ is an atom in $L$ and hence\ncompact, there is a finite subset $F\\subseteq S$ such that\n$\\alpha_k\\le \\bigvee F$. Because $F\\subseteq I$, $x\\le \\bigvee F$, and\nso $\\alpha_k\\vee x\\le \\bigvee F$, meaning that $\\alpha_k\\vee x$ is\ncompact in $I$. This shows that $b_i$, as a finite join of compact\nelements in $I$, is compact in $I$ as well. In turn, this shows that $a$\nis a join of compact elements in $I$.\n\nSince $I$ is both complete and each of its elements is a join of compact\nelements, $I$ is algebraic.\n\nNext, we show that $I$ is semimodular. If $c,d\\in I$ with\n$c\\wedge d\\prec c$ ($c\\wedge d$ is ** by $c$). Since $L$ is semimodular,\n$d\\prec c\\vee d$. As $c\\vee d$ is the least upper bound of\n$\\lbrace c,d\\rbrace$, $c\\vee d\\le y$, and thus $c\\vee d\\in I$. So $I$ is\nsemimodular.\n\nFinally, we show that every compact element of $I$ is a finite join of\natoms in $I$. Suppose $a\\in I$ is compact. Then certainly\n$a\\le \\bigvee I$. Consequently, $a\\le \\bigvee J$ for some finite subset\n$J$ of $I$. But since $L$ is atomistic, each element in $J$ is a join of\natoms in $L$. Take the join of each of the atoms with $x$, we get either\n$x$ or an atom in $I$. Thus, each element in $J$ is a join of atoms in\n$I$ and hence $a$ is a join of atoms in $I$.\n\nNote that in the above proof, $b_i$ is in fact a finite join of atoms in\n$I$, for if $\\alpha_k\\le x$, then $\\alpha_k\\vee x=x$. Otherwise,\n$\\alpha_k\\vee x$ covers $x$ (since $L$ is semimodular), which means that\n$\\alpha_k\\vee x$ is an atom in $I$.\n\n**Remark**. In matroid theory, where geometric lattices play an\nimportant role, lattices considered are generally assumed to be finite.\nTherefore, any lattice in this context is automatically complete and\nevery element is compact. As a result, any finite lattice is geometric\nif it is semimodular and atomistic.",
