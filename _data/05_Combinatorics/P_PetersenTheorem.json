  "statement": "Every finite , , 2-edge connected graph has a complete matching.\n\nUsing the notations from the Tutte theorem, we have to prove that for\nall $X\\subseteq V(G)$ the inequality $c_p(G-X)\\leq |X|$ holds. There are\nat least $3$ edges running between $X$ and an odd component of $G-X$:\nthere cannot be one edge, since $G$ is 2-edge connected, and there also\ncannot be two edges, because three edges start from all vertices of an\nodd component, so the number of edges leaving an odd component is odd.\nLet $t$ be the number of all edges between $X$ and the odd components of\n$G-X$. Now we have $t\\geq 3c_p(G-X)$. But $G$ is 3-regular, thus\n$t\\leq 3|X|$. This gives $c_p(G-X)\\leq |X|$.",
