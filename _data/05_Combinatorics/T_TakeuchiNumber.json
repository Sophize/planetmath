  "definition": "The $n$th [*Takeuchi number*]{} $T_n$ is the value of the function\n$T(n, 0, n + 1)$ which measures how many times the Takeuchi function\n$t(x, y, z)$ has to call itself to give the answer starting with\n$x = n, y = 0, z = n + 1$. For example, the second Takeuchi number is 4,\nsince $t(2, 0, 3)$ requires four recursions to obtain the answer 2. The\nfirst few Takeuchi numbers are 0, 1, 4, 14, 53, 223, 1034, 5221, 28437,\nlisted in A000651 of Sloane\u2019s OEIS. Prellberg gives a formula for the\nasymptotic growth of the Takeuchi numbers:\n$$T_n ~ cB_n\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2W(n)^2}\\right)$$, where $c$ is the\nTakeuchi-Prellberg constant (approximately 2.2394331), $B_n$ is the\n$n$th Bernoulli number and $W(x)$ is Lambert\u2019s $W$ function.\n\n[2]{} Steven R.
