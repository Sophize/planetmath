  "definition": "For any non-negative integer $n$, the [*factorial*]{} of $n$, denoted\n$n!$, can be defined by $$n!=\\prod_{r=1}^n r$$ where for $n=0$ the empty\nproduct is taken to be $1$.\n\nAlternatively, the factorial can be defined recursively by $0!=1$ and\n$n!=n(n-1)!$ for $n>0$.\n\n$n!$ is equal to the number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects. For\nexample, there are $5!$ ways to arrange the five letters A, B, C, D and\nE into a word.\n\nFor every non-negative integer $n$ we have $$\\Gamma(n+1) = n!$$ where\n$\\Gamma$ is Euler\u2019s gamma function. In this way the notion of factorial\ncan be generalized to all values except the negative integers.",
