  "statement": "Let $G(V,E)$ be any finite graph. $G$ has a complete matching if and\nonly if for all $X \\subseteq V(G)$ the inequality $c_p(G-X) \\leq |X|$\nholds, where $c_p(H)$ is the number of the components of the $H$ graph\nwith odd number of vertices. This is called the Tutte condition.\n\nIn a complete matching there is at least one edge between $X$ and the\nodd components of $G-X$, and different edges have distinct endvertices.\nSo $c_p(G-X)\\leq|X|$. This proves the necessity.\n\nThe sufficiency is proved in a few steps indirectly.\n\n1.  It is very easy to see that if $|V(G)|$ is even, then\n    $c_p(G-X)\\neq|X|-1$ and $c_p(G-X)\\neq|X|+1$. This will be used\n    later. And if the Tutte condition holds, applying it to\n    $X=\\emptyset$ gives $|V(G)|$ is even.\n\n2.  Now assume there exists a graph satisfying the Tutte condition but\n    without complete matching ,and let $G$ be such a counterexample with\n    the lowest number of vertices. There exist a set $Y\\subseteq V(G)$\n    such that $c_p(G-Y)=|Y|$, examples are the empty set and every\n    vertex. Let $Y_0$ be such set with the highest number of vertices.\n\n3.  If $G_s$ is an even component in $G-Y_0$, then adding its vertex $t$\n    to $Y_0$ gives $c_p(G-Y_0-\\{t\\})\\geq|Y_0|+1$, because it creates at\n    least one odd component. But this with the Tutte condition gives\n    $c_p(G-Y_0-\\{t\\})=|Y_0\\cup\\{t\\}|$, which contradicts the maximality\n    of $Y_0$. So there are no even components in $G-Y_0$.\n\n4.  Let $G_p$ be an odd component of $G-Y_0$, and let $t$ any of its\n    vertices. Assume there is no complete matching in $G_p-\\{t\\}$. Since\n    $G$ is minimal counterexample, there exits a set\n    $X\\subseteq G_p-\\{t\\}$ such that $c_p(G_p-\\{t\\}-X)>|X|$, but because\n    of $(1)$ it is at least $|X|+2$. Then\n    $c_p(G-X-Y_0-\\{t\\})\\geq|Y_0|-1+|X|+2=|X\\cup Y_0\\cup\\{t\\}|$, which\n    contradicts the maximality of $Y_0$. So by removing any vertex from\n    an odd component the remaining part has a complete matching.\n\n5.  Represent each odd components by one vertex, and remove the edges in\n    $Y_0$. From the definition of $Y_0$ this is a bipartite graph. If we\n    choose $p$ vertices from the representatives of the odd components,\n    they are together adjacent to at least $p$ vertices in $Y_0$,\n    otherwise we could remove less than $p$ vertices from $Y_0$ thus\n    from $V(G)$, and still get $p$ odd component, which violates the\n    Tutte condition. So there is complete matching in this reduced graph\n    because of Hall\u2019s marriage theorem.\n\n6.  The complete matching in the reduced graph covers $Y_0$ and exactly\n    one vertex in each odd component. But there is also a matching in\n    the rest of each odd component covering the rest as proven in $(4)$,\n    and from $(3)$ there are no even components. Combining these gives a\n    complete matching of $G$, which is a contradiction.",
