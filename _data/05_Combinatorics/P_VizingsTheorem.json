  "statement": "Definitions and notation {#definitions-and-notation .unnumbered}\n------------------------\n\nIn a graph or multigraph $G$, let $\\rho(\\0v)$ denote the valency of\nvertex (node) $\\0v$, and let $\\rho(G)$ denote the largest valency in $G$\n(often written just $\\rho$ on its own, $\\Delta(G)$ is another common\nnotation).\n\nLet the multiplicity $\\mu(\\0v,\\0w)$ of vertices (nodes) $\\0v$ and $\\0w$\nbe the number of parallel edges that link them, and here too let\n$\\mu(G)$ be the largest multiplicity in $G$. A graph is a multigraph for\nwhich $\\mu(G)=1$.\n\nAn [**edge coloring**]{} of a (multi)graph $G$ is a mapping from the set\n$E$ of its edges to a set $K$ of items called colors, in such a way that\nat any vertex $\\0v$, the $\\rho(\\0v)$ edges there all have a different\ncolor. An [**edge-$k$-coloring**]{} is an edge-coloring where $|K|=k$.\n\nNote that a loop (an edge joining $\\0v$ to itself) accounts for two of\nthe $\\rho(\\0v)$ edges at $\\0v$ and cannot have a color different from\nitself, so edge-colorings as defined here do not exist for pseudographs\n(structures that are allowed to have loops).\n\nThe [**chromatic index**]{} (aka [**edge-chromatic number**]{})\n${\\chi\\,}'(G)$ is the smallest number $k$ for which an edge-$k$-coloring\nof $G$ exists. This now standard notation is analogous to the\n[**chromatic number**]{} $\\chi(G)$ which refers to vertex coloring.\n\nVizing\u2019s theorem {#vizings-theorem .unnumbered}\n----------------\n\nFor any multigraph $G$ (this includes graphs), we have of course\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\ge\\; \\rho(G)$$ immediately from the definition.\nSurprisingly though, we also have\n\n[**Theorem (Vizing)**]{}$\\quad$ For any graph $G$,\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\le\\; \\rho(G)+1$$ This celebrated theorem was proved by\nV.\u00a0G.\u00a0Vizing in 1964 while still a graduate student (at Novosibirsk). It\nis a special case of\n\n[**Theorem (Vizing)**]{}$\\quad$ For any multigraph $G$,\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\le\\; \\rho(G)+\\mu(G)$$ (edge-coloring of multigraphs is\nthe subject of Vizing\u2019s doctoral thesis, 1965). The theorem was proved\nindependently by R.\u00a0P.\u00a0Gupta in 1966; nowadays various versions of the\nproofs exist. A key r\u00f4le is played by connected subgraphs $H(a,b)$ of\ncolors $a$ and $b$ that cannot be extended further. They are analogous\nto Kempe chains in face or vertex colorings, but have a simpler\nstructure: they are either paths or closed paths (the latter of even\nlength). (in the case of graphs).\n\nOre\u00a0[@Ore67] gives a sharper bound for multigraphs. Let the [**enlarged\nvalency**]{} $\\rho^+(\\0v)$ be given by\n$$\\rho^+(\\0v) \\;\\isdef\\; \\rho(\\0v) + \\max_{\\rm w} \\mu(\\0v,\\0w)$$ where\n$\\0w$ can be taken over all vertices of the graph; it effectively only\nranges over those adjacent to $\\0v$ (as $\\mu(\\0v,\\0w)$ is zero for the\nothers). Again, let $\\rho^+(G)$ denote the maximum enlarged valency\noccurring in $G$. Now\n\n[**Theorem (Ore)**]{}$\\quad$ For any multigraph $G$,\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\le\\; \\rho^+(G)$$\n\nShannon\u2019s theorem {#shannons-theorem .unnumbered}\n-----------------\n\nThe following theorem was proven in 1949 by Claude E.\u00a0Shannon. He also\ngives examples, for any value of $\\rho$, of multigraphs that actually\nattain the bound, the so-called Shannon graphs: they have three\nvertices, with $\\mu(\\0a,\\0b)=\\mu(\\0a,\\0c)=\\lfloor\\rho/2\\rfloor$ and\n$\\mu(\\0b,\\0c)=\\lceil\\rho/2\\rceil$.\n\n[**Theorem (Shannon)**]{}$\\quad$ For any multigraph $G$,\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\le\\; \\lfloor\\frac32\\rho(G)\\rfloor$$ While giving a\nmuch worse bound for graphs, it gives for some multigraphs a better\nbound than Vizing\u2019s theorem. Nevertheless, it is also possible to prove\nit from the latter\u00a0[@FW77].\n\nOnly in the context of graph colorings is [*Shannon\u2019s theorem*]{}\nunderstood to refer to the one here; in the wider world the term tends\nto refer to any of his fundamental theorems in information theory.\n\nHere too Ore\u00a0[@Ore67] gives a sharper bound based on the maximum of a\nlocal expression. Let $\\sigma(\\0v)$ be 0 if $\\0v$ has fewer than two\nneighbours, and otherwise $$\\sigma(\\0v) \\;\\isdef\\;\n  \\max_{{\\rm v}',\\,{\\rm v}''} (\\rho(\\0v) + \\rho(\\0v') + \\rho(\\0v''))$$\nwhere $\\0v'$ and $\\0v''$ range over all pairs of distinct neighbours of\n$\\0v$. Again, let $\\sigma(G)$ be its largest value in the graph.\n\n[**Theorem (Ore)**]{}$\\quad$ For any multigraph $G$,\n$${\\chi\\,}'(G) \\;\\le\\; \\max(\\rho(G),\\lfloor\\frac12\\sigma(G)\\rfloor)$$\n\nChromatic class {#chromatic-class .unnumbered}\n---------------\n\nVizing\u2019s theorem has the effect of placing each multigraph $G$ in one of\nthe classes 0, 1, 2, \u2026\u00a0$\\mu(G)$ where the class number is\n${\\chi\\,}'(G)-\\rho(G)$.\n\nFor graphs it means they split into just two classes: those that can be\nedge-colored in $\\rho(G)$ colors and those that need $\\rho(G)+1$ colors.\nThe logical name for them would be class\u00a00 and class\u00a01; unfortunately\nthe standard terminology is class\u00a01 and 2 (or I and II).\n\n[**Class I**]{} (graphs that can be edge-$\\rho$-colored) contains among\nothers\n\n-   single $n$-cycles for even $n$ $^\\dagger$\n\n-   complete graphs $K_n$ for even $n$ $^\\ddagger$\n\n-   bipartite graphs (this is Knig\u2019s theorem, 1916)\n\n-   bridgeless planar trivalent graphs (four-color theorem via Tait\n    coloring)\n\n-   planar graphs with $\\rho(G)\\ge8$ (by another theorem of Vizing)\n\n-   planar graphs with $\\rho(G)\\ge6$?? (conjecture of Vizing)\n\n[**Class II**]{} (graphs that need $\\rho+1$ colors) contains among\nothers\n\n-   single $n$-cycles for odd $n$ $^\\dagger$\n\n-   complete graphs $K_n$ for odd $n$ $^\\ddagger$\n\n-   $K_n$ for odd $n$ with a few edges missing (by a couple of theorems)\n\n-   trivalent graphs with a bridge $^\\pilcrow$\n\nbut the general classification problem has thus far eluded the best\nefforts of Vizing and many others. There are interesting links here with\npolyhedral decompositions (aka cyclic double covers) and embeddings in\nsurfaces.\n\nA(n [**edge-**]{})[**critical graph**]{} is a connected graph of class\nII but such that removing any of its edges makes it class I. As often in\ngraph theory, such a minimality condition imposes a certain amount of\nstructure on the graph. There are conjectures\u2026\n\nAlmost all graphs are in class I {#almost-all-graphs-are-in-class-i .unnumbered}\n--------------------------------\n\nLet $\\#G_n$ be the number of graphs with $n$ vertices, and\n$\\#G^{\\,\\rm I}_n$ the number of them in class\u00a0I.\n\n[**Theorem (P.\u00a0Erd\u0151s and R.\u00a0J.\u00a0Wilson)**]{}$\\quad$\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} {\\#G^{\\,\\rm I}_n \\over \\#G_n} = 1$$ So graphs of\nclass II get [*relatively*]{} rarer for larger graph sizes. The\n[*absolute*]{} numbers do still increase. For cubic graphs for instance,\nwe saw every one with a bridge is in class II. Bridgeless cubic graphs\nof class II are a bit thinner on the ground. By the four-color theorem,\nvia Tait coloring, we know all of them are non-planar. Rarer still are\nthose of them with girth at least five (and some non-triviality\nconditions); they are so hard to find that Martin Gardner dubbed them\n[**snarks**]{}. The Petersen graph is one, and a few infinite families\nof snarks have been found.\n\n$\\dagger\\quad$ $\\rho=2$, so an edge-$\\rho$-coloring must use alternating\ncolors. For odd $n$ that\u2019s impossible.\n\n$\\ddagger\\quad$ $\\rho=n-1$, note it is also the valency of every vertex.\nFix two colors $a$ and $b$. A Kempe chain $H(a,b)$ can only terminate at\na vertex where one of those colors is missing but in $K_n$ we cannot\nafford to miss any color at any vertex, so every $H(a,b)$ is a cycle of\neven length and together they visit all $n$ vertices. For odd $n$ that\u2019s\nimpossible. For even $n$ there are ways to construct the coloring (try\nit).\n\n$\\pilcrow\\;\\;$ $\\rho = 3$ and again the valency of every vertex. For the\nsame reason as in the previous note, every $H(a,b)$ or $H(c,a)$ or\n$H(b,c)$ is a cycle. Every edge must be in two such, but a bridge cannot\nbe part of a cycle.\n\n[MST73]{}\n\n, ,\\\nAcad.\u00a0Pr.\u00a01967,\\\n[*Long the standard work on its subject, but written before the theorem\nwas proven.
