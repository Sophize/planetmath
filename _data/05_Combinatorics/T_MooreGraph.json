  "definition": "Moore graphs {#moore-graphs .unnumbered}\n------------\n\nIt is easy to see that if a graph $G$ has diameter $d$ (and has any\ncycles at all), its girth $g$ can be no more than $2d+1$. For suppose\n$g\\ge2d+2$ and $O$ is a cycle of that minimum length $g$. Take two\nvertices (nodes) A and B on $O$ that are $d+1$ steps apart along $O$,\none way round; they are $g-(d+1)\n\\ge d+1$ steps apart the other way round. Now either there is no shorter\nroute between A and B (contradicting diameter $d$) or there is a shorter\nroute of length $r\\lt d+1$ creating a cycle of length $d+1+r\\lt 2d+2$\n(contradicting girth $g$).\n\n[**Definition**]{}: A [**Moore graph**]{} is a connected graph with\nmaximal girth $2d+1$ for its diameter $d$.\n\nIt can be shown that Moore graphs are regular, i.e.\u00a0all vertices have\nthe same valency. So a Moore graph is characterised by its diameter and\nvalency.\n\nMoore graphs with $d=1$, $g=3$ {#moore-graphs-with-d1-g3 .unnumbered}\n------------------------------\n\nDiameter 1 means every vertex (node) is adjacent to every other, that\nis, a complete graph. Indeed, complete graphs $K_n$ that have cycles\n($n\\ge3$) have triangles, so the girth is 3 and they are Moore graphs.\nEvery valency $v\\ge2$ occurs ($K_n$ has valency $n-1$).\n\nMoore graphs with $d=2$, $g=5$ {#moore-graphs-with-d2-g5 .unnumbered}\n------------------------------\n\nThis is the most interesting case. And that every vertex has the same\nvalency, $v$ say, and that the graph now has $n=v^2+1$ vertices in all,\nis easy here.\n\nWith some more work, it can be shown there are only 4 possible values\nfor $v$ and $n$:\n\n    $v$    $n$ graph\n  ----- ------ -------------------------\n      2      5 pentagon\n      3     10 Petersen graph\n      7     50 Hoffman\u2013Singleton graph\n     57   3250 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0???\n\nThe first three cases each have a unique solution. The existence or\notherwise of the last case is still . It has been shown that if it\nexists it has, unlike the first three, very little symmetry.\n\nThe Hoffman\u2013Singleton graph is a bit hard to draw. Here\u2019s a unified\ndescription of the three known Moore graphs of $d=2$, all indices\n(mod\u00a05):\n\n-   [**Pentagon:**]{} five vertices, which we can label\n    $P^{\\vphantom0}_k$.\n\n    Each $P^{\\vphantom0}_k$ is connected by two edges to\n    $P^{\\vphantom0}_{k\\pm1}$.\n\n-   [**Petersen:**]{} ten vertices, which we can label $P^{\\,\\circ}_k$\n    and $P^{\\,\\star}_k$.\n\n    Each $P^{\\,\\circ}_k$ is connected by two edges to\n    $P^{\\,\\circ}_{k\\pm1}$ and by one to $P^{\\,\\star}_{2k}$.\n\n    Each $P^{\\,\\star}_k$ is connected by two edges to\n    $P^{\\,\\star}_{k\\pm1}$ and by one to $P^{\\,\\circ}_{3k}$.\n\n-   [**Hoffman\u2013Singleton:**]{} fifty vertices, which we can label\n    $P^{\\,\\circ}_{n,k}$ and $P^{\\,\\star}_{m,k}$.\n\n    Each $P^{\\,\\circ}_{n,k}$ is connected by two edges to\n    $P^{\\,\\circ}_{n,k\\pm1}$ and by five to $P^{\\,\\star}_{m,mn+2k}$ for\n    all $m$.\n\n    Each $P^{\\,\\star}_{m,k}$ is connected by two edges to\n    $P^{\\,\\star}_{m,k\\pm1}$ and by five to $P^{\\,\\circ}_{n,2mn+3k}$ for\n    all $n$.\n\nThe automorphism group of the pentagon is the dihedral group with 10\nelements. The one of the Petersen graph is isomorphic to $S_5$, with 120\nelements. And the one of the HS graph is isomorphic to\n$\\hbox{PSU}(3,5)\\cdot 2$, with 252000 elements, a maximal subgroup of\nanother HS, the Higman-Sims group.\n\nMoore graphs with $d\\ge3$, $g\\ge7$ {#moore-graphs-with-dge3-gge7 .unnumbered}\n----------------------------------\n\nIn these cases, there are only Moore graphs with valency 2, graphs\nconsisting of a single $2d+1$-gon cycle. This was proven independently\nby Bannai and Ito and by Damerell.",
