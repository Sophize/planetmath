  "statement": "We recall that the degree (sometimes called valency) of a vertex $v$ of\nan undirected graph $G$ is the number $\\delta(v)$ of $v$\u2019s neighbors,\n[*i.e.*]{}, the number of vertices $z$ of $G$ such that an edge $(v,z)$\nexists.\n\nLet $G=(V,E)$ be a simple nondirected finite graph. Then\n$$\\label{eq:handshake}\n\\sum_{v\\in V}\\delta(v)=2|E|\\;.$$\n\n*Proof.* List all the edges of $G$, with their endpoints, each edge\nonce. Each vertex $v$ occurs a number of times equal to the number of\nedges $v$ is an endpoint of, [*i.e.*]{}, the number $\\delta(v)$ of its\nneighbors. On the other hand, each edge has two endpoints, thus the sum\nof all occurrences of vertices must equal twice the number of edges.\n$\\Box$\n\nA simple finite undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd\ndegree.\n\n*Proof.* By the handshake lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices\nof odd degree must be even, which is only possible if their number is\neven. $\\Box$\n\nThe following two statements about trees also follow from the handshake\nlemma. Recall that the maximum degree of a node in a finite tree cannot\nexceed the number of leaves of the tree, because each subtree of any\nnode contains at least one leaf.\n\nA finite tree with exactly three leaves is homeomorphic to $K_{1,3}$.\n\n*Proof.* A finite tree with three leaves can have no vertex of degree\ngreater than 3. By the handshake lemma, the number of vertices of odd\ndegree must be even: this forces a vertex of degree 3 to exist. Such a\nvertex is also unique, because if there were two, the tree would have at\nleast four leaves. All the other vertices, except the leaves, have\ndegree 2, and it is possible to contract them all to get $K_{1,3}$; such\na sequence of contractions is in fact a graph homeomorphism. $\\Box$\n\nA finite tree with exactly four leaves is homeomorphic to either\n$K_{1,4}$ or two joint copies of $K_{1,3}$.\n\n*Proof.* If a vertex of degree 4 exists, then no other vertex of degree\ngreater than 2 can exist, or the tree would have five or more leaves.\nOtherwise, a vertex of degree 3 must exist, or the tree would be a\nstreamline with only two leaves; by the handshake lemma, there must be\nanother one, and no more, or the tree would have at least five leaves.\nAll the other vertices, except the leaves, have degree 2, and it is\npossible to contract them all to get either $K_{1,4}$ (if there is a\nvertex of degree 4) or two joint copies of $K_{1,3}$ (if there are two\nvertices of degree 3); such a sequence of contractions is in fact a\ngraph homeomorphism. $\\Box$",
