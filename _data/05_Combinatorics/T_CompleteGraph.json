  "definition": "The *complete graph* with $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, contains all\npossible edges; that is, any two vertices are adjacent.\n\nThe complete graph of $4$ vertices, or $K_4$ looks like this:\n\n![image](k4.eps)\n\nThe number of edges in $K_n$ is the $n-1$th triangular number. Every\nvertex in $K_n$ has degree $n-1$; therefore $K_n$ has an Euler circuit\nif and only if $n$ is odd. A complete graph always has a Hamiltonian\npath, and the chromatic number of $K_n$ is always $n$.",
