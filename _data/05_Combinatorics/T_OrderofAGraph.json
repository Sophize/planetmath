  "definition": "The *order* of a graph $G$ is the number of vertices in $G$; it is\ndenoted by $|G|$. The same notation is used for the number of elements\n(cardinality) of a set. Thus, $|G| = |V(G)|$. We write $G^n$ for an\n*arbitrary graph of order n*. Similarly, $G(n,m)$ denotes an *arbitrary\ngraph of order n and size m*.",
