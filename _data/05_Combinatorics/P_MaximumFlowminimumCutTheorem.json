  "statement": "Let $G$ be a finite digraph with nonnegative weights and with exactly\none sink and exactly one source. Then\n\nI\\) For any flow $f$ on $G$ and any cut $C$ of $G$, the amount of flow\nfor $f$ is less than or equal to the weight of $C$.\n\nII\\) There exists a flow $f_0$ on $G$ and a cut $C_0$ of $G$ such that\nthe amount of the flow of $f_0$ equals the weight of $C_0$.\n\n**Proof:** (I) is easy, so we prove only (II). Write ${\\mathbb R^+}$ for\nthe set of nonnegative real numbers. Let $V$ be the set of vertices of\n$G$. Define a matrix $$\\kappa:V\\times V\\to{\\mathbb R^+}$$ where\n$\\kappa(x,y)$ is the sum of the weights (or capacities) of all the\ndirected edges from $x$ to $y$. By hypothesis there is a unique $v\\in V$\n(the source) such that $$\\kappa(x,v)=0\\qquad\\forall x\\in V$$ and a\nunique $w\\in V$ (the sink) such that\n$$\\kappa(w,x)=0\\qquad\\forall x\\in V\\;.$$ We may also assume\n$\\kappa(x,x)=0$ for all $x\\in V$. Any flow $f$ will correspond uniquely\n(see Remark below) to a matrix $$\\varphi:V\\times V\\to{\\mathbb R^+}$$\nsuch that $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\varphi(x,y)&\\le&\\kappa(x,y)\\qquad\\forall x,y\\in V \\\\\n\\sum_z\\varphi(x,z)&=&\\sum_z\\varphi(z,x)\\qquad\\forall x\\ne v,w\\end{aligned}$$\nLet $\\lambda$ be the matrix of any maximal flow, and let $A$ be the set\nof $x\\in V$ such that there exists a finite sequence\n$x_0=v,x_1,\\ldots,x_n=x$ such that for all $m$ from $1$ to $n-1$, we\nhave either $$\\label{eq:a}\n\\lambda(x_m,x_{m+1})<\\kappa(x_m,x_{m+1})$$ or $$\\label{eq:b}\n\\lambda(x_{m+1},x_m)>0\\;.$$ Write $B=V-A$.\n\nTrivially, $v\\in A$. Let us show that $w\\in B$. Arguing by\ncontradiction, suppose $w\\in A$, and let $(x_m)$ be a sequence from $v$\nto $w$ with the properties we just mentioned. Take a real number\n$\\epsilon>0$ such that\n$$\\epsilon+ \\lambda(x_m,x_{m+1})<\\kappa(x_m,x_{m+1})$$ for all the\n(finitely many) $m$ for which (\\[eq:a\\]) holds, and such that\n$$\\lambda(x_{m+1},x_m)>\\epsilon$$ for all the $m$ for which (\\[eq:b\\])\nholds. But now we can define a matrix $\\mu$ with a larger flow than\n$\\lambda$ (larger by $\\epsilon$) by:\n$$\\mu(x_m,x_{m+1})=\\epsilon+\\lambda(x_m,x_{m+1})\n\\qquad\\text{if (\\ref{eq:a}) holds}$$\n$$\\mu(x_{m+1},x_m)=\\lambda(x_{m+1},x_m)-\\epsilon\n\\qquad\\text{if (\\ref{eq:b}) holds}$$ $$\\mu(a,b)=\\lambda(a,b)\n\\qquad\\text{for all other pairs }(a,b)\\;.$$ This contradiction shows\nthat $w\\in B$.\n\nNow consider the set $C$ of pairs $(x,y)$ of vertices such that $x\\in V$\nand $y\\in W$. Since $W$ is nonempty, $C$ is a cut. But also, for any\n$(x,y)\\in C$ we have $$\\label{eq:c}\n\\lambda(x,y)=\\kappa(x,y)$$ for otherwise we would have $y\\in V$. Summing\n(\\[eq:c\\]) over $C$, we see that the amount of the flow $f$ is the\ncapacity of $C$, QED.\n\n**Remark:** We expressed the proof rather informally, because the\nterminology of graph theory is not very well standardized and cannot all\nbe found yet here at PlanetMath.
