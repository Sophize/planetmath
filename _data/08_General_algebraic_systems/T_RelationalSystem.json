  "definition": "A *relational system*, loosely speaking, is a pair $(A,R)$ where $A$ is\na set and $R$ is a set of finitary relations defined on $A$ (a finitary\nrelation is just an $n$-ary relation where $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$; when $n=1$,\nit is called a property). Since an $n$-ary operator on a set is an\n$(n+1)$-ary the set, a relational system can be thought of as a\ngeneralization of an algebraic system. We can formalize the notion of a\nrelation system as follows:\n\n> Call a set $R$ a relation set, if there is a function\n> $f:R\\to \\mathbb{N}$, the set of natural numbers. For each $r\\in R$,\n> call $f(r)$ the arity of $r$.\n>\n> Let $A$ be a set and $R$ a *relation set*. The pair $(A,R)$ is called\n> an $R$-relational system if there is a set $R_A$ such that\n>\n> -   $R_A$ is a set of finitary relations on $A$, called the *relation\n>     set* of $A$, and\n>\n> -   there is a one-to-one correspondence between $R$ and $R_A$, given\n>     by $r \\mapsto r_A$, such that the $f(r)=$ the arity of $r_A$.\n>\nSince operators and partial operators are special types of relations.\nalgebraic systems and partial algebraic systems can be treated as\nrelational systems.\n\nBelow are some exmamples of relational systems:\n\n-   any algebraic or partial algebraic system.\n\n-   a poset $(P,\\lbrace \\le_P\\rbrace)$, where $\\le_P$ is a binary\n    relation, called the partial ordering, on $P$. A lattice, generally\n    considered an algebraic system, can also be considered as a\n    relational system, because it is a poset, and that $\\le$ alone\n    defines the algebraic operations ($\\vee$ and $\\wedge$).\n\n-   a pointed set $(A,\\lbrace a\\rbrace)$ is also a relational system,\n    where a unary relation, or property, is the singled-out element\n    $a\\in A$. A pointed set is also an algebraic system, if we treat $a$\n    as the lone nullary operator (constant).\n\n-   a bounded poset $(P,\\le_P,0,1)$ is a relational system. It is a\n    poset, with two unary relations $\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$ and\n    $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$.\n\n-   a Buekenhout-Tits geometry can be thought of as a relational system.\n    It consists of a set $\\Gamma$ with two binary relations on it: one\n    is an equivalence relation $T$ called type, and the other is a\n    symmetric reflexive relation $\\#$ called incidence, such that if\n    $a\\#b$ and $aTb$, then $a=b$ (incident objects of the same type are\n    identical).\n\n-   ordered algebraic structures, such as ordered groups\n    $(G,\\lbrace \\cdot\\mbox{, }^{-1}\\mbox{, }e\\mbox{, }\\le_G\\rbrace)$ and\n    ordered rings\n    $(R,\\lbrace +\\mbox{, }-\\mbox{, }\\cdot\\mbox{, }^{-1}\\mbox{, }0\\mbox{, }\\le_R\\rbrace)$\n    are also relational systems. They are not algebraic systems because\n    of the additional ordering relations ($\\le_G$ and $\\le_R$) defined\n    on these objects. Note that these orderings are generally considered\n    total orders.\n\n-   ordered partial algebras such as ordered fields\n    $(D,\\lbrace +\\mbox{, }-\\mbox{, }\\cdot\\mbox{, }^{-1}\\mbox{, }0\\mbox{, }1\\mbox{, }\\le_F\\rbrace)$,\n    etc...\n\n-   structures that are not relational are and topological spaces,\n    because the operations involved are infinitary.\n\n**Remark**. Relational systems and algebraic systems are both examples\nof structures in model theory. Although an algebraic system is a\nrelational system in the sense discussed above, they are treated as\ndistinct entities. A structure involves three objects, a set $A$, a set\nof function symbols $F$, and a set of relation symbols $R$, so a\nrelational system is a structure where $F=\\varnothing$ and an algebraic\nsystem is a structure where $R=\\varnothing$.\n\n[7]{} G.
