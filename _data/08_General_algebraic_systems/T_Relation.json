  "definition": "### Binary Relations {#binary-relations .unnumbered}\n\nBefore describing what a *relation* is generally, let us define a more\nspecific kind of a relation: a *binary relation*. Basically, a binary\nrelation $R$ involves objects coming from two collections $A,B$, where\nthe objects are paired up so that each pair consists of an object from\n$A$, and an object from $B$.\n\nMore formally, a *binary relation* is a subset $R$ of the of two sets\n$A$ and $B$. One may write $$a\\: R\\: b$$ to indicate that the ordered\npair $(a, b)$ is an element of $R$. A subset of $A\\times A$ is simply\ncalled a binary relation on $A$. If $R$ is a binary relation on $A$,\nthen we write\n$$a_1 \\: R \\: a_2 \\: R \\: a_3 \\: \\cdots \\: a_{n-1} \\: R \\: a_n$$ to mean\n$a_1 \\: R\\: a_2, a_2\\: R\\: a_3, \\ldots,$ and $a_{n-1}\\: R \\: a_n$.\n\nGiven a binary relation $R\\subseteq A\\times B$, the *domain*\n$\\operatorname{dom}(R)$ of $R$ is the set of elements in $A$ forming\nparts of the pairs in $R$. In other words,\n$$\\operatorname{dom}(R):=\\lbrace x\\in A\\mid (x,y)\\in R \\mbox{ for some }y \\in B \\rbrace$$\nand the *range* $\\operatorname{ran}(R)$ of $R$ is the set of parts of\npairs of $R$ coming from $B$:\n$$\\operatorname{ran}(R):=\\lbrace y\\in B\\mid (x,y)\\in R \\mbox{ for some }x\\in A \\rbrace.$$\n\nAn example of a binary relation is the less-than relation on the\nintegers, i.e., $<$ $\\subseteq\\Z\\times\\Z$. $(1, 2) \\in$ $<$, but\n$(2, 1) \\notin$ $<$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  In set theory, a binary relation is simply a set of ordered pairs\n    (of sets or classes, depending on the axiom system used). Notice\n    that, unlike the previous definition, sets (or classes) $A$ and $B$\n    are not specified in advance. Given a (binary) relation $R$, the\n    domain of $R$ is the set (or class) of elements $a$ such that\n    $a R b$ for some $b$, and the range of $R$ is the set (or class) or\n    elements $b$ such that $a R b$ for some $a$. The union and the\n    domain and the range of $R$ is called the *field* of $R$.\n\n2.  It may be possible to define a relation over a class. For example,\n    if $\\mathcal{C}$ is the class of all sets, then $\\in$ can be thought\n    of as a binary relation on $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n3.  In term rewriting theory, a binary relation on a set is sometimes\n    called a *reduction*, and is written $\\to$. This is to signify that\n    $a\\to b$ means that the element $a$ is being \u201creduced\u201d to $b$ via\n    $\\to$.\n\n### Arbitrary Relations {#arbitrary-relations .unnumbered}\n\nFrom the definition of a binary relation, we can easily generalize it to\nthat of an arbitrary relation. Since a binary relation involves two\nsets, an arbitrary relation involves an arbitrary collection of sets.\nMore specifically, a *relation* $R$ is a subset of some of a collection\nof sets. In symbol, this is $$R\\subseteq \\prod_{i\\in I} A_i$$ where each\n$A_i$ is a set, indexed by some set $I$.\n\nFrom this more general definition, we see that a binary relation is just\na relation where $I$ has two elements. In addition, an *$n$-ary\nrelation* is a relation where the cardinality of $I$ is $n$ ($n$\nfinite). In symbol, we have $$R\\subseteq\\prod_{i=1}^n A_i.$$ It is not\nhard to see that any $n$-ary relation where $n>1$ can be viewed as a\nbinary relation in $n-1$ different ways, for\n$$R\\subseteq A_1\\times A_2\\times \\cdots \\times A_n= \\prod_{i=1}^j A_i\\times \\prod_{i=j+1}^n A_i,$$\nwhere $j$ ranges from $1$ through $n-1$.\n\nA common name for a $3$-ary relation is a *ternary relation*. It is also\npossible to have a *$1$-ary relation*, or commonly known as a *unary\nrelation*, which is nothing but a subset of some set.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  Following from the first remark from the previous section, relations\n    of higher arity can be inductively defined: for $n>1$, an\n    $(n+1)$-ary relation is a binary relation whose domain is an $n$-ary\n    relation. In this setting, a \u201cunary relation\u201d and relations whose\n    arity is of \u201carbitrary\u201d cardinality are not defined.\n\n2.  A relation can also be viewed as a function (which itself is a\n    relation). Let $R\\subseteq A:=\\prod_{i\\in I} A_i$. As a subset of\n    $A$, $R$ can be identified with the characteristic function\n    $$\\chi_R:A\\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace,$$ where $\\chi_R(x)=1$ iff $x\\in R$\n    and $\\chi_R(x)=0$ otherwise. Therefore, an $n$-ary relation is\n    equivalent to an $(n+1)$-ary characteristic function. From this, one\n    may say that a $0$-ary, or a *nullary relation* is a unary\n    characteristic function. In other words, a nullary relation is just\n    a an element in $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ (or truth/falsity).",
