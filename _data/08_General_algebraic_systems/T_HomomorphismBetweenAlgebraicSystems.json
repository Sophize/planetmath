  "definition": "Let $(A,O),(B,O)$ be two algebraic systems with operator set $O$. Given\noperators $\\omega_A$ on $A$ and $\\omega_B$ on $B$, with $\\omega\\in O$\nand $n=$ arity of $\\omega$, a function $f:A\\to B$ is said to be\n*compatible* with $\\omega$ if\n$$f(\\omega_A(a_1,\\ldots,a_n))=\\omega_B(f(a_1),\\ldots,f(a_n)).$$\n\nDropping the subscript, we now simply identify $\\omega\\in O$ as an\noperator for both algebras $A$ and $B$. If a function $f:A\\to B$ is\ncompatible with every operator $\\omega\\in O$, then we say that $f$ is a\n*homomorphism* from $A$ to $B$. If $O$ contains a constant operator\n$\\omega$ such that $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$ are two constants assigned by\n$\\omega$, then any homomorphism $f$ from $A$ to $B$ maps $a$ to $b$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  When $O$ is the empty set, any function from $A$ to $B$ is a\n    homomorphism.\n\n2.  When $O$ is a singleton consisting of a constant operator, a\n    homomorphism is then a function $f$ from one pointed set $(A,p)$ to\n    another $(B,q)$, such that $f(p)=q$.\n\n3.  A homomorphism defined in any one of the well known algebraic\n    systems, such as groups, modules, rings, and is consistent with the\n    more general definition given here. The essential thing to remember\n    is that a homomorphism preserves constants, so that between two\n    rings with 1, both the additive identity 0 and the multiplicative\n    identity 1 are preserved by this homomorphism. Similarly, a\n    homomorphism between two is called a $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$- because\n    it preserves both 0 and 1, the bottom and top elements of the\n    lattices.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Like the familiar algebras, once a homomorphism is defined, special\n    types of homomorphisms can now be named:\n\n    -   a homomorphism that is one-to-one is a *monomorphism*;\n\n    -   an onto homomorphism is an *epimorphism*;\n\n    -   an *isomorphism* is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism;\n\n    -   a homomorphism such that its codomain is its domain is called an\n        *endomorphism*;\n\n    -   finally, an *automorphism* is an endomorphism that is also an\n        isomorphism.\n\n-   All trivial algebraic systems (of the same type) are isomorphic.\n\n-   If $f:A\\to B$ is a homomorphism, then the image $f(A)$ is a\n    subalgebra of $B$. If $\\omega_B$ is an $n$-ary operator on $B$, and\n    $c_1,\\ldots,c_n\\in f(A)$, then\n    $\\omega_B(c_1,\\ldots,c_n)=\\omega_B(f(a_1),\\ldots,f(a_n))=f(\\omega_A(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))\\in f(A)$.\n    $f(A)$ is sometimes called the *homomorphic image* of $f$ in $B$ to\n    emphasize the fact that $f$ is a homomorphism.",
