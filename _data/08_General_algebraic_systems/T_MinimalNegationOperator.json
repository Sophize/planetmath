  "definition": "The **minimal negation operator** $\\nu$ is a multigrade operator\n$(\\nu_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where each $\\nu_k$ is a $k$-ary boolean\nfunction defined in such a way that $\\nu_k (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) = 1$ in\njust those cases where exactly one of the arguments $x_j$ is $0$.\n\nIn contexts where the initial letter $\\nu$ is understood, the minimal\nnegation operators can be indicated by argument lists in parentheses. In\nthe following text a distinctive typeface will be used for logical\nexpressions based on minimal negation operators, for example,\n$\\texttt{(x, y, z)}$ = $\\nu (x, y, z).$\n\nThe first four members of this family of operators are shown below, with\nparaphrases in a couple of other notations, where tildes and primes,\nrespectively, indicate logical negation.\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\n\\texttt{()}\n& = & \\nu_0\n& = & 0\n& = & \\operatorname{false}\n\\\\[6pt]\n\\texttt{(x)}\n& = & \\nu_1 (x)\n& = & \\tilde{x}\n& = & x^\\prime\n\\\\[6pt]\n\\texttt{(x, y)}\n& = & \\nu_2 (x, y)\n& = & \\tilde{x}y \\lor x\\tilde{y}\n& = & x^\\prime y \\lor x y^\\prime\n\\\\[6pt]\n\\texttt{(x, y, z)}\n& = & \\nu_3 (x, y, z)\n& = & \\tilde{x}yz \\lor x\\tilde{y}z \\lor xy\\tilde{z}\n& = & x^\\prime y z \\lor x y^\\prime z \\lor x y z^\\prime\n\\end{matrix}$\n\nTo express the general case of $\\nu_k$ in terms of familiar operations,\nit helps to introduce an intermediary concept:\n\n**Definition.** Let the function $\\lnot_j : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$\nbe defined for each integer $j$ in the interval $[1, k]$ by the\nfollowing equation:\n\n$$\\lnot_j (x_1, \\ldots, x_j, \\ldots, x_k) ~=~ x_1 \\land \\ldots \\land x_{j-1} \\land \\lnot x_j \\land x_{j+1} \\land \\ldots \\land x_k.$$\n\nThen $\\nu_k : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ is defined by the following\nequation:\n\n$$\\nu_k (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) ~=~ \\lnot_1 (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\lor \\ldots \\lor \\lnot_j (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\lor \\ldots \\lor \\lnot_k (x_1, \\ldots, x_k).$$\n\nIf we think of the point $x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\in \\mathbb{B}^k$ as\nindicated by the boolean product $x_1 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_k$ or the\nlogical conjunction $x_1 \\land \\ldots \\land x_k,$ then the minimal\nnegation $\\texttt{(} x_1, \\ldots, x_k \\texttt{)}$ indicates the set of\npoints in $\\mathbb{B}^k$ that differ from $x$ in exactly one coordinate.\nThis makes $\\texttt{(} x_1, \\ldots, x_k \\texttt{)}$ a discrete\nfunctional analogue of a *point omitted neighborhood* in analysis, more\nexactly, a *point omitted distance one neighborhood*. In this light, the\nminimal negation operator can be recognized as a differential\nconstruction, an observation that opens a very wide field. It also\nserves to explain a variety of other names for the same concept, for\nexample, *logical boundary operator*, *limen operator*, *least action\noperator*, or *hedge operator*, to name but a few. The rationale for\nthese names is visible in the venn diagrams of the corresponding\noperations on sets.\n\nThe remainder of this discussion proceeds on the *algebraic boolean\nconvention* that the plus sign $(+)$ and the summation symbol\n$(\\textstyle\\sum)$ both refer to addition modulo 2. Unless otherwise\nnoted, the boolean domain $\\mathbb{B} = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$ is interpreted so\nthat $0 = \\operatorname{false}$ and $1 = \\operatorname{true}.$ This has\nthe following consequences:\n\n-   The operation $x + y$ is a function equivalent to the exclusive\n    disjunction of $x$ and $y,$ while its fiber of $1$ is the relation\n    of inequality between $x$ and $y.$\n\n-   The operation $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^k x_j$ maps the bit sequence\n    $(x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$ to its *parity*.\n\nThe following properties of the minimal negation operators\n$\\nu_k : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ may be noted:\n\n-   The function $\\texttt{(x, y)}$ is the same as that associated with\n    the operation $x + y$ and the relation $x \\ne y.$\n\n-   In contrast, $\\texttt{(x, y, z)}$ is not identical to $x + y + z.$\n\n-   More generally, the function $\\nu_k (x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ for $k > 2$\n    is not identical to the boolean sum $\\textstyle\\sum_{j=1}^k x_j.$\n\n-   The inclusive disjunctions indicated for the $\\nu_k$ of more than\n    one argument may be replaced with exclusive disjunctions without\n    affecting the meaning, since the terms disjoined are already\n    disjoint.\n\nTruth tables\n============\n\nTable 1 is a truth table for the sixteen boolean functions of type\n$f : \\mathbb{B}^3 \\to \\mathbb{B}$, each of which is either a boundary of\na point in $\\mathbb{B}^3$ or the complement of such a boundary.\n\n[|c|c|c|c|c|]{}\\\n$L_1$ & $L_2$ & & $L_3$ & $L_4$\\\nDecimal & Binary & & Sequential & Parenthetical\\\n& & $p =$ & 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 &\\\n& & $q =$ & 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 &\\\n& & $r =$ & 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 &\\\n$f_{104}$ & $f_{01101000}$ & & 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 &\n$\\texttt{(~p~,~q~,~r~)}$\\\n$f_{148}$ & $f_{10010100}$ & & 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 &\n$\\texttt{(~p~,~q~,(r))}$\\\n$f_{146}$ & $f_{10010010}$ & & 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{(~p~,(q),~r~)}$\\\n$f_{97}$ & $f_{01100001}$ & & 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{(~p~,(q),(r))}$\\\n$f_{134}$ & $f_{10000110}$ & & 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{((p),~q~,~r~)}$\\\n$f_{73}$ & $f_{01001001}$ & & 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{((p),~q~,(r))}$\\\n$f_{41}$ & $f_{00101001}$ & & 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{((p),(q),~r~)}$\\\n$f_{22}$ & $f_{00010110}$ & & 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{((p),(q),(r))}$\\\n$f_{233}$ & $f_{11101001}$ & & 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{(((p),(q),(r)))}$\\\n$f_{214}$ & $f_{11010110}$ & & 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{(((p),(q),~r~))}$\\\n$f_{182}$ & $f_{10110110}$ & & 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{(((p),~q~,(r)))}$\\\n$f_{121}$ & $f_{01111001}$ & & 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{(((p),~q~,~r~))}$\\\n$f_{158}$ & $f_{10011110}$ & & 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 &\n$\\texttt{((~p~,(q),(r)))}$\\\n$f_{109}$ & $f_{01101101}$ & & 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 &\n$\\texttt{((~p~,(q),~r~))}$\\\n$f_{107}$ & $f_{01101011}$ & & 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 &\n$\\texttt{((~p~,~q~,(r)))}$\\\n$f_{151}$ & $f_{10010111}$ & & 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 &\n$\\texttt{((~p~,~q~,~r~))}$\\\n\nCharts and graphs\n=================\n\nThis Section focuses on visual representations of minimal negation\noperators. A few bits of terminology are useful in describing the\npictures, but the formal details are tedious reading, and may be\nfamiliar to many readers, so the full definitions of the terms marked in\nbold are relegated to a Glossary at the end of the article.\n\nTwo ways of visualizing the space $\\mathbb{B}^k$ of $2^k$ points are the\n*hypercube* picture and the *venn diagram* picture. The hypercube\npicture associates each point of $\\mathbb{B}^k$ with a unique point of\nthe $k$-dimensional hypercube. The venn diagram picture associates each\npoint of $\\mathbb{B}^k$ with a unique \u201ccell\u201d of the venn diagram on $k$\n\u201ccircles\u201d.\n\nIn addition, each point of $\\mathbb{B}^k$ is the unique point in the\n**fiber of truth** $[|s|]$ of a **singular proposition**\n$s : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$, and thus it is the unique point where\na **singular conjunction** of $k$ **literals** is equal to 1.\n\nFor example, consider two cases at opposite vertices of the $k$-cube:\n\n-   The point $(1, 1, \\ldots, 1, 1)$ with all 1\u2019s as coordinates is the\n    point where the conjunction of all posited variables evaluates to 1,\n    namely, the point where:\n\n    $$x_1 ~ x_2 ~\\ldots~ x_{k-1} ~ x_k ~=~ 1$$\n\n-   The point $(0, 0, \\ldots, 0, 0)$ with all 0\u2019s as coordinates is the\n    point where the conjunction of all negated variables evaluates to 1,\n    namely, the point where:\n\n    $$\\texttt{(} x_1 \\texttt{)(} x_2 \\texttt{)} \\ldots \\texttt{(} x_{k-1} \\texttt{)(} x_k \\texttt{)} ~=~ 1$$\n\nTo pass from these limiting examples to the general case, observe that a\nsingular proposition $s : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ can be given\ncanonical expression as a conjunction of literals,\n$s = e_1 ~ e_2 ~\\ldots~ e_{k-1} ~ e_k$. Then the proposition\n$\\nu(e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_{k-1}, e_k)$ is 1 on the points adjacent to the\npoint where $s$ is 1, and 0 everywhere else on the cube.\n\nFor example, consider the case where $k = 3$. Then the minimal negation\noperation $\\nu(p, q, r)$ \u2014 written more simply as $\\texttt{(p, q, r)}$ \u2014\nhas the following venn diagram:\n\n  ----------------------------------\n    ![image](VennDiagram_JOF_PQR)\n   Figure 2. \u00a0 $\\texttt{(p, q, r)}$\n  ----------------------------------\n\nFor a contrasting example, the boolean function expressed by the form\n$\\texttt{((p),(q),(r))}$ has the following venn diagram:\n\n  --------------------------------------\n      ![image](VennDiagram_JOT_PQR)\n   Figure 3. \u00a0 $\\texttt{((p),(q),(r))}$\n  --------------------------------------\n\nGlossary of basic terms\n=======================\n\n-   A **boolean domain** $\\mathbb{B}$ is a generic 2-element set, say,\n    $\\mathbb{B} = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$, whose elements are interpreted as logical\n    values, usually but not invariably with 0 = *false* and 1 = *true*.\n\n-   A **boolean variable** $x$ is a variable that takes its value from a\n    boolean domain, as $x \\in \\mathbb{B}$.\n\n-   In situations where boolean values are interpreted as logical\n    values, a boolean-valued function $f : X \\to \\mathbb{B}$ or a\n    boolean function $g : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ is frequently\n    called a **proposition**.\n\n-   Given a sequence of $k$ boolean variables, $x_1, \\ldots, x_k$, each\n    variable $x_j$ may be treated either as a basis element of the space\n    $\\mathbb{B}^k$ or as a coordinate projection\n    $x_j : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$.\n\n-   This means that the $k$ objects $x_j$ for $j$ = $1$ to $k$ are just\n    so many boolean functions $x_j : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$,\n    subject to logical interpretation as a set of *basic propositions*\n    that generate the complete set of $2^{2^k}$ propositions over\n    $\\mathbb{B}^k$.\n\n-   A **literal** is one of the $2k$ propositions\n    $x_1, \\ldots, x_k, \\texttt{(} x_1 \\texttt{)}, \\ldots, \\texttt{(} x_k \\texttt{)}$,\n    in other words, either a *posited* basic proposition $x_j$ or a\n    *negated* basic proposition $\\texttt{(} x_j \\texttt{)}$, for some\n    $j$ = $1$ to $k$.\n\n-   In mathematics generally, the **fiber** of a point $y$ under a\n    function $f : X \\to Y$ is defined as the inverse image $f^{-1}(y)$.\n\n-   In the case of a boolean-valued function $f : X \\to \\mathbb{B}$,\n    there are just two fibers:\n\n    > The fiber of 0 under $f$, defined as $f^{-1}(0)$, is the set of\n    > points where $f$ is 0.\n    >\n    > The fiber of 1 under $f$, defined as $f^{-1}(1)$, is the set of\n    > points where $f$ is 1.\n\n-   When 1 is interpreted as the logical value *true*, then $f^{-1}(1)$\n    is called the **fiber of truth** in the proposition $f$. Frequent\n    mention of this fiber makes it useful to have a shorter way of\n    referring to it. This leads to the definition of the notation\n    $[|f|] = f^{-1}(1)$ for the fiber of truth in the proposition $f$.\n\n-   A **singular boolean function** $s : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ is\n    a boolean function whose fiber of 1 is a single point of\n    $\\mathbb{B}^k$.\n\n-   In the interpretation where 1 equals *true*, a singular boolean\n    function is called a **singular proposition**.\n\n-   Singular boolean functions and singular propositions serve as\n    functional or logical representatives of the points in\n    $\\mathbb{B}^k$.\n\n-   A **singular conjunction** in $(\\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B})$ is a\n    conjunction of $k$ literals that includes just one conjunct of the\n    pair $\\{ x_j, ~ \\nu(x_j) \\}$ for each $j$ = $1$ to $k$.\n\n-   A singular proposition $s : \\mathbb{B}^k \\to \\mathbb{B}$ can be\n    expressed as a singular conjunction:\n\n    > $\\begin{array}{lll}\n    > s & = & e_1 ~ e_2 ~\\ldots~ e_{k-1} ~ e_k\n    > \\\\\n    > \\text{where} & e_j & = x_j\n    > \\\\\n    > \\text{or}    & e_j & = \\nu(x_j)\n    > \\\\\n    > \\text{for}   & j   & = 1 ~\\text{to}~ k\n    > \\end{array}$",
