  "definition": "In this entry, all algebraic systems are of the same type. For each\nalgebraic system, we drop the associated operator set for simplicity.\n\nLet $A_i$ be algebraic systems indexed by $i\\in I$. $B$ is called a\n*subdirect product* of $A_i$ if\n\n1.  $B$ is a subalgebra of the direct product of $A_i$.\n\n2.  for each $i\\in I$, $\\pi_i(B)=A_i$.\n\nIn the second condition, $\\pi_i$ denotes the projection homomorphism\n$\\prod A_i \\to A_i$. By restriction, we may consider $\\pi_i$ as\nhomomorphisms $B\\to A_i$. When $B$ is isomorphic to $\\prod A_i$, then\n$B$ is a *trivial subdirect product* of $A_i$.\n\nThis generalizes the notion of a direct product, since in many\ninstances, an algebraic system can not be decomposed into a direct\nproduct of algebras.\n\nWhen all $A_i=C$ for some algebraic system $C$ of the same type, then\n$B$ is called a *subdirect power* of $C$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  A very simple example of a subdirect product is the following: let\n    $A_1=A_2=\\lbrace 1,2,3\\rbrace$. Then the subset\n    $B=\\lbrace (x,y)\\in A_1\\times A_2 \\mid x\\le y \\rbrace$ is a\n    subdirect product of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ (considered as\n    algebraic systems with no operators).\n\n2.  Let $B$ is a subdirect product of $A_i$, and $p_i:=(\\pi_i)_B$, the\n    restriction of $\\pi_i$ to $B$. Then $B/\\ker(p_i)\\cong A_i$. In\n    addition, $$\\bigcap \\lbrace \\ker(p_i)\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace=\\Delta,$$\n    where $\\Delta$ is the diagonal relation. To see the last equality,\n    suppose $a,b\\in B$ with $a\\equiv b \\pmod {p_i}$. Then\n    $a(i)=\\pi_i(a)=p_i(a)=p_i(b)=\\pi_i(b)=b(i)$. Since this is true for\n    every $i\\in I$, $a=b$.\n\n3.  Conversely, if $A$ is an algebraic system and\n    $\\lbrace \\mathfrak{C}_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a set of congruences\n    on $A$ such that\n    $$\\bigcap \\lbrace \\mathfrak{C}_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace=\\Delta.$$ Then\n    $A$ is isomorphic to a subdirect product of $A/\\mathfrak{C}_i$.\n\n4.  An algebraic system is said to be *subdirectly irreducible* if,\n    whenever $\\mathfrak{C}_i$ are congruences on $A$ and\n    $\\bigcap \\lbrace \\mathfrak{C}_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace=\\Delta$, then one\n    of $\\mathfrak{C}_i=\\Delta$.\n\n5.  **Birkhoff\u2019s Theorem on the Decomposition of an Algebraic System**.\n    Every algebraic system is isomorphic to a subdirect product of\n    subdirectly irreducible algebraic systems. This works only when the\n    algebraic system is finitary.",
