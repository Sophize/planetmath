  "definition": "### Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n\nFix a set $A$. A *property* $\\mathcal{P}$ of $n$-ary relations on a set\n$A$ may be thought of as some subset of the set of all $n$-ary relations\non $A$. Since an $n$-ary relation is just a subset of $A^n$,\n$\\mathcal{P}\\subseteq P(A^n)$, the powerset of $A^n$. An $n$-ary\nrelation is said to have property $\\mathcal{P}$ if $R \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nFor example, the transitive property is a property of binary relations\non $A$; it consists of all transitive binary relations on $A$. Reflexive\nand symmetric properties are sets of reflexive and symmetric binary\nrelations on $A$ correspondingly.\n\nLet $R$ be an $n$-ary relation on $A$. By the *closure* of an $n$-ary\nrelation $R$ with respect to property $\\mathcal{P}$, or the\n$\\mathcal{P}$-closure of $R$ for short, we mean the smallest relation\n$S\\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $R\\subseteq S$. In other words, if\n$T\\in \\mathcal{P}$ and $R\\subseteq T$, then $S\\subseteq T$. We write\n$\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{P}}(R)$ for the $\\mathcal{P}$-closure of\n$R$.\n\nGiven an $n$-ary relation $R$ on $A$, and a property $\\mathcal{P}$ on\n$n$-ary relations on $A$, does $\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{P}}(R)$\nalways exist? The answer is no. For example, let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the\nanti-symmetric property of binary relations on $A$, and $R=A^2$. For\nanother example, take $\\mathcal{P}$ to be the irreflexive property, and\n$R=\\Delta$, the diagonal relation on $A$.\n\nHowever, if $A^n \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ is closed under\narbitrary intersections, then $\\mathcal{P}$ is a complete lattice\naccording to , and, as a result, $\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{P}}(R)$\nexists for any $R\\subseteq A^n$.\n\n### Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive Closures {#reflexive-symmetric-and-transitive-closures .unnumbered}\n\nFrom now on, we concentrate on binary relations on a set $A$. In\nparticular, we fix a binary relation $R$ on $A$, and let $\\mathcal{X}$\nthe reflexive property, $\\mathcal{S}$ the symmetric property, and\n$\\mathcal{T}$ be the transitive property on the binary relations on $A$.\n\nArbitrary intersections are closed in $\\mathcal{X}$, $\\mathcal{S}$, and\n$\\mathcal{T}$. Furthermore, if $R$ is any binary relation on $A$, then\n\n-   $R^=:=\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{X}}(R)=R\\cup \\Delta$, where\n    $\\Delta$ is the diagonal relation on $A$,\n\n-   $R^{\\leftrightarrow}:=\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{S}}(R)=R\\cup R^{-1}$,\n    where $R^{-1}$ is the converse of $R$, and\n\n-   $R^+:=\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathcal{T}}(R)$ is given by\n    $$\\bigcup_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}} R^n = R\\cup (R\\circ R) \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\underbrace{(R\\circ \\cdots \\circ R)}_{\\displaystyle{n}\\mbox{-fold power}} \\cup \\cdots ,$$\n    where $\\circ$ is the relational composition operator.\n\n-   $R^*:=R^{=+}=R^{+=}$.\n\n$R^=$, $R^{\\leftrightarrow}$, $R^+$, and $R^*$ are called the *reflexive\nclosure*, the *symmetric closure*, the *transitive closure*, and the\n*reflexive transitive closure* of $R$ respectively. The last item in the\nproposition permits us to call $R^*$ the *transitive reflexive closure*\nof $R$ as well (there is no difference to the order of taking closures).\nThis is true because $\\Delta$ is transitive.\n\n**Remark**. In general, however, the order of taking closures of a\nrelation is important. For example, let $A=\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, and\n$R=\\lbrace (a,b)\\rbrace$. Then\n$R^{\\leftrightarrow +}=A^2\\ne \\lbrace (a,b),(b,a)\\rbrace = R^{+ \\leftrightarrow}$.",
