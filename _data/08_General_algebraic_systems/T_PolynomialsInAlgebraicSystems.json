  "definition": "Polynomials in an Algebraic System {#polynomials-in-an-algebraic-system .unnumbered}\n----------------------------------\n\nLet $(A,O)$ be an algebraic system. Given any non-negative integer $n$,\nlet $S$ be a set of functions from $A^n$ to $A$, satisfying the\nfollowing criteria:\n\n1.  the projection $\\pi_i:A^n\\to A$ is an element of $S$ for each $i$\n    between $1$ and $n$.\n\n2.  for every $0$-ary operator symbol $c\\in O$, the corresponding\n    element $c_A\\in A$ is an element of $S$.\n\n3.  for any $m$-ary operator $\\omega_A$ on $A$, and any\n    $p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\in S$, the function\n    $\\omega_A(p_1,\\ldots,p_m):A^n\\to A$, given by\n    $$\\omega_A(p_1,\\ldots,p_m)(a_1,\\ldots,a_n):=\\omega_A(p_1(a_1,\\ldots,a_n),\\ldots, p_m(a_1,\\ldots,a_n))$$\n    is an element of $S$.\n\nTake the intersection of all such sets and call it $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$.\nThen $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$ is the smallest set satisfying the above two\nconditions. We call an element of $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$ an *$n$-ary\npolynomial* of the algebra $A$. A *polynomial* of $A$ is some $n$-ary\npolynomial of $A$. Two polynomials $p,q$ are said to be *equivalent* if\nthey have the same arity $n$, and for any $\\textbf{a}\\in A^n$,\n$p(\\textbf{a})=q(\\textbf{a})$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n-   Let $G$ be a group. Then $f(x)=x$ is a unary polynomial. In general,\n    a unary polynomial of $G$ has the form $x^n$, $n\\ge 1$. For a binary\n    polynomial, first note that $f(x,y)=x$ and $g(x,y)=y$ are both\n    binary. For this, a binary polynomial of $G$ looks like\n    $$x^{n_1}y^{m_1}\\cdots x^{n_k}y^{m_k},$$ where $n_1,m_k\\ge 0$ and\n    the rest are positive integers. If $G$ is abelian, a binary\n    polynomial has the simplified form $x^ny^m$, and more generally, an\n    $n$-ary polynomial of an abelian group has the form\n    $$x_1^{n_1}\\cdots x_k^{n_k}.$$\n\n-   Let $R$ be a ring. $f(x)=x$ is a unary polynomial, so are $g(x)=nx$\n    and $h(x)=x^m$ where $n,m$ are non-negative integers. In general, a\n    unary polynomial of $R$ looks like\n    $$n_mx^{m}+n_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\\cdots + n_1x+n_0,$$ where $n_i$ are\n    non-negative integers with $n_m>0$, and $m$ is any positive integer.\n    This is the form of a polynomial that is familiar to most people.\n\n-   Continuing from the example above, note that, however,\n    $$a_mx^{m}+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\\cdots + a_1x+a_0$$ where $a_i\\in R$ is in\n    general *not* a polynomial under this definition. This is an example\n    of an algebraic function in an algebraic system.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   $\\textbf{P}_0(A)$ is non-empty iff $O$ contains constant symbols\n    (nullary function symbols).\n\n-   By virtue of the definition, $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$ is an algebraic\n    system for each non-negative integer $n$.\n\nPolynomial Symbols {#polynomial-symbols .unnumbered}\n------------------\n\nIf we have two algebras $A,B$ of the same type, then, by the definition\nabove, a polynomial of $A$ may be considered as a polynomial of $B$, and\nvice versa. Putting this formally, we introduce *polynomial symbols* for\na class $K$ of algebras of the same type $O$. Let\n$X=\\lbrace x_1,x_2,\\ldots\\rbrace$ be a countably infinite set of\nvariables, or symbols. For any non-negative integer $n$, consider a set\n$S$ consisting of the following elements:\n\n1.  $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$,\n\n2.  every nullary operator symbol,\n\n3.  if $\\omega\\in O$ is $m$-ary and $p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\in S$, then\n    $\\omega(p_1, \\ldots, p_m)\\in S$.\n\nTake the intersection of all such sets and we end up with a set\nsatisfying the two conditions again, call it $\\textbf{P}_n(O)$. Any\nelement of $\\textbf{P}_n(O)$ is called an *$n$-ary polynomial symbol* of\n$K$. A *polynomial symbol* of $K$ is just some $n$-ary polynomial\nsymbol. In model theory, a polynomial symbol is nothing more than a over\n$X$ in the $O$-language.\n\nNow, suppose $A\\in K$. For a given non-negative integer $n$, consider\nthe function $f_A:\\textbf{P}_n(O)\\to \\textbf{P}_n(A)$, defined\nrecursively by\n\n1.  $f_A(x_i):=\\pi_i$,\n\n2.  $f_A(c):=c_A$,\n\n3.  $f_A(\\omega(p_1,\\ldots,p_n)):=\\omega_A(f_A(p_1),\\ldots,f_A(p_n))$.\n\nThen by the constructions of $\\textbf{P}_n(O)$ and $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$,\n$f_A$ is a surjection. Any polynomial $p$ of $A$ is said to be *induced*\nby a polynomial symbol $q$ of $K$ if $f_A(q)=p$. We usually write\n$p=q_A$ to denote that the polynomial $p$ (of $A$) is induced by the\npolynomial symbol $q$ (of $K$). It is not hard to see that, between two\nalgebras of the same type, there is a one-to-one correspondence between\ntheir respective polynomials the same arities. However, equivalence of\npolynomials in one algebra does not translate to equivalence in another.\n\n**Example**. $x\\vee(y\\wedge z)$ and $(x\\vee y)\\wedge (x\\vee z)$ are both\npolynomials symbols in the class of lattices. In the subclass of\ndistributive lattices, the induced polynomials are equivalent. However,\nin the subclass of modular lattices, the equivalence no longer holds.\n\n**Remark**. Like $\\textbf{P}_n(A)$, $\\textbf{P}_n(O)$ is also an\nalgebraic system, called the $n$-ary *polynomial algebra*, or\n*absolutely free algebra*, of $O$. Furthermore, the function $f_A$ above\nis an algebra homomorphism.\n\n[9]{} G. Gr\u00e4tzer: [*Universal Algebra*]{}, 2nd Edition, Springer, New\nYork (1978). S. Burris, H.P.
