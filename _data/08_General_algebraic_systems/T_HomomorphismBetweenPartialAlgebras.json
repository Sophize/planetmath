Similar to the definition\nof homomorphisms between algebras, a homomorphism\n$\\phi: \\boldsymbol{A}\\to \\boldsymbol{B}$ between two partial algebras of\ntype $\\tau$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ that satisfies the equation\n$$\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))= f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$$\nfor every $n$-ary function symbol $f\\in \\tau$. However, because\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ are not everywhere defined\nin their respective domains, care must be taken as to what the equation\nmeans.\n\n1.  $\\phi$ is a *homomorphism* if, given that\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined, so is\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$, and equation (1)\n    is satisifed.\n\n2.  $\\phi$ is a *full homomorphism* if it is a homomorphism and, given\n    that $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined and in\n    $\\phi(A)$, for $b_i\\in \\phi(A)$, there exist $a_i\\in A$ with\n    $b_i=\\phi(a_i)$, such that $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is\n    defined.\n\n3.  $\\phi$ is a *strong homomorphism* if it is a homomorphism and, given\n    that $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$ is defined,\n    so is $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$.\n\nWe have the following implications:\n\n> strong homomorphism $\\rightarrow$ full homomorphism $\\rightarrow$\n> homomorphism.\n\nFor example, field homomorphisms are strong homomorphisms.\n\nHomomorphisms preserve constants: for each constant symbol $f$ in\n$\\tau$, $\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}) = f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$. In fact, when\nrestricted to constants, $\\phi$ is a bijection between constants of\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$ and constants of $\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nWhen $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is an algebra (all partial operations are total),\na homomorphism from $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is always strong, so that all three\nnotions of homomorphisms coincide.\n\nAn *isomorphism* is a bijective homomorphism\n$\\phi: \\boldsymbol{A}\\to \\boldsymbol{B}$ such that its inverse\n$\\phi^{-1}: \\boldsymbol{B}\\to \\boldsymbol{A}$ is also a homomorphism. An\n*embedding* is an injective homomorphism. Isomorphisms and full\nembeddings are strong.\n\n### Homomorphic Images {#homomorphic-images .unnumbered}\n\nThe various types of homomorphisms and the various types of subalgebras\nare related. Suppose $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are partial\nalgebras of type $\\tau$. Let $\\phi:A\\to B$ be a function, and\n$C=\\phi(A)$. For each $n$-ary function symbol $f\\in \\tau$, define\n$n$-ary partial operation $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ on $C$ as follows:\n\n> for $b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\in C$, $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is\n> defined iff the set\n> $$D:=\\lbrace (a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\in A^n \\mid \\phi(a_i)=b_i\\rbrace \\cap \\operatorname{dom}(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}})$$\n> is non-empty, where $\\operatorname{dom}(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}})$ is the\n> domain of definition of $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$, and when this is the\n> case,\n> $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n):=\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))$,\n> for some $(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)\\in D$.\n\nIf $\\phi$ preserves constants (if any), and $f_C$ is non-empty for each\n$f\\in \\tau$ then $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a partial algebra of type $\\tau$.\n\nFix an arbitrary $n$-ary symbol $f\\in \\tau$. The following are the basic\nproperties of $\\boldsymbol{C}$:\n\n$\\phi$ is a homomorphism iff $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a weak subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nSuppose first that $\\phi$ is a homomorphism. If $n=0$, then\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}} \\in A$, and\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}} = \\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}) \\in C$. If $n>0$, then\nfor some $a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\in A$, $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$\nis defined, and consequently\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1), \\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$ is defined, and is\nequal to $\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)) \\in C$. By the\ndefinition for $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ above,\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(\\phi(a_1), \\ldots, \\phi(a_n)):=\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n))$.\nThis shows that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a $\\tau$-algebra.\n\nTo furthermore show that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a weak subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$, assume $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is\ndefined. Then there are $a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\in A$ with $b_i=\\phi(a_i)$ such\nthat $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined. Since $\\phi$ is a\nhomomorphism, $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots,\\phi(a_n))$, and\nhence $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$, is defined. Furthermore,\n$f_C(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)=\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))=f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots,\\phi(a_n))=f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$.\nThis shows that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is weak.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose now that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a weak\nsubalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$. Suppose $a_1,\\ldots, a_n\\in A$ and\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined. Let\n$b_i=\\phi(a_i)\\in C$. Then, by the definition of $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}$,\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined and is equal to\n$\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))$. Since $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is\nweak, $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined and is equal to\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$. As a result,\n$\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))=f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)=f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)= f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$.\nHence $\\phi$ is a homomorphism.\n\n$\\phi$ is a full homomorphism iff $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a relative\nsubalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nSuppose first that $\\phi$ is full. Since $\\phi$ is a homomorphism,\n$\\boldsymbol{C}$ is weak. Suppose $b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\in C$ such that\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined and is in $C$. Since\n$\\phi$ is full, there are $a_i\\in A$ such that $b_i = \\phi(a_i)$ and\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined, and\n$\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n))=f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))=f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$,\nso that $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$ is defined and thus\n$\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a relative subalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nConversely, suppose that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a relative subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$. Then $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a weak subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$ and $\\phi$ is a homomorphism. To show that $\\phi$ is\nfull, suppose that $b_i\\in C$ such that\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined in $C$. Then\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined in $C$ and is equal to\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$. This means that there are\n$a_i\\in A$ such that $b_i=\\phi(a_i)$, and\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined, showing that\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ is full.\n\n$\\phi$ is a strong homomorphism iff $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nSuppose first that $\\phi$ is strong. Since $\\phi$ is full,\n$\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a relative subalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$. Suppose\nnow that for $b_i\\in C$, $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is\ndefined. Since $b_i=\\phi(a_i)$ for some $a_i \\in A$, and since $\\phi$ is\nstrong, $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is defined. This means\nthat\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)= f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))=\\phi(f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))$,\nwhich is in $C$. So $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nGoing the other direction, suppose now that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a\nsubalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a relative\nsubalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{B}$, $\\phi$ is full. To show that $\\phi$ is\nstrong, suppose $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$ is\ndefined. Then $f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$ is\ndefined and is equal to\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(\\phi(a_1),\\ldots, \\phi(a_n))$. By definition of\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{C}}$, $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)$ is therefore\ndefined. So $\\phi$ is strong.\n\n**Definition**. Let $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ be partial\nalgebras of type $\\tau$. If $\\phi:\\boldsymbol{A}\\to \\boldsymbol{B}$ is a\nhomomorphism, then $\\boldsymbol{C}$, as defined above, is a partial\nalgebra of type $\\tau$, and is called the *homomorphic image* of $A$ via\n$\\phi$, and is sometimes written $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{A})$.\n\n[7]{} G.
