  "definition": "An algebraic system, loosely speaking, is a set, together with some\noperations on the set. Before formally defining what an algebraic system\nis, let us recall that a $n$-ary operation (or operator) on a set $A$ is\na function whose domain is $A^n$ and whose range is a subset of $A$.\nHere, $n$ is a non-negative integer. When $n=0$, the operation is\nusually called a nullary operation, or a constant, since one element of\n$A$ is singled out to be the (sole) value of this operation. A finitary\noperation on $A$ is just an $n$-ary operation for some non-negative\ninteger $n$.\n\n**Definition**. An *algebraic system* is an ordered pair $(A,O)$, where\n$A$ is a set, called the underlying set of the algebraic system, and $O$\nis a set, called the operator set, of finitary operations on $A$.\n\nWe usually write $\\boldsymbol{A}$, instead of $(A,O)$, for brevity.\n\nA prototypical example of an algebraic system is a group, which consists\nof the underlying set $G$, and a set $O$ consisting of three operators:\na constant $e$ called the multiplicative identity, a unary operator\ncalled the multiplicative inverse, and a binary operator called the\nmultiplication.\n\nFor a more comprehensive listing of examples, please see this .\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   An algebraic system is also called an algebra for short. Some\n    authors require that $A$ be non-empty. Note that $A$ is\n    automatically non-empty if $O$ contains constants. A *finite\n    algebra* is an algebra whose underlying set is finite.\n\n-   By definition, all operators in an algebraic system are finitary. If\n    we allow $O$ to contain infinitary operations, we have an\n    *infinitary algebraic system*. Other generalizations are possible.\n    For example, if the operations are allowed to be multivalued, the\n    algebra is said to be a *multialgebra*. If the operations are not\n    everywhere defined, we get a *partial algebra*. Finally, if more\n    than one underlying set is involved, then the algebra is said to be\n    *many-sorted*.\n\nThe study of algebraic systems is called the theory of universal\nalgebra. The first important thing in studying algebraic system is to\ncompare systems that are of the same \u201ctype\u201d. Two algebras are said to\nhave the same *type* if there is a one-to-one correspondence between\ntheir operator sets such that an $n$-ary operator in one algebra is\nmapped to an $n$-ary operator in the other algebra. A more formal way of\ndoing this is to define what a *type* is:\n\n**Definition**. A *type* is a set $\\tau$, whose elements are called\noperator symbols, such that there is a function\n$a:\\tau \\to \\mathbb{N}\\cup \\lbrace 0\\rbrace$. Given an operator symbol\n$f$, its image $a(f)$ is called the arity of $f$.\n\n**Remark**. It is often the practice to well-order $\\tau$, and write\n$\\tau$ as a sequence of non-negative integers\n$\\langle a(f_1), a(f_2), \\ldots, \\rangle$. When $\\tau$ is finite, the\nconvention is to order the sequence in non-increasing order:\n$a(f_1)\\ge a(f_2)\\ge \\cdots \\ge a(f_n)$.\n\n**Definition**. An algebraic system $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is said to be of\ntype $\\tau$ if there is a bijection between $O$ and $\\tau$ so that every\noperator symbol $f$ in $\\tau$ corresponds to an operator\n$f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ of arity $a(f)$ in $O$. When the algebra\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$ is said to be of type $\\tau$, we also say that\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$ is a $\\tau$-algebra.\n\nFor example, a group is an algebraic system of type\n$\\langle 2,1,0\\rangle$, where $2$ is the arity of the group\nmultiplication, $1$ is the arity of the group inverse, and $0$ is the\narity of the group multiplicative identity.\n\n[7]{} . . : [ ** ]{}. \u201c\u201d.
