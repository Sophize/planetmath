  "definition": "Unlike an algebraic system, where there is only one way to define a\nsubalgebra, there are several ways to define a subalgebra of a partial\nalgebra.\n\nSuppose $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are partial algebras of\ntype $\\tau$:\n\n1.  $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a *weak subalgebra* of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ if\n    $B\\subseteq A$, and $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ is a subfunction of\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ for every operator symbol $f\\in \\tau$.\n\n    In words, $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a weak subalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{A}$\n    iff $B\\subseteq A$, and for each $n$-ary symbol $f\\in \\tau$, if\n    $b_1,\\ldots, b_n \\in B$ such that $f_B(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined,\n    then $f_A(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is also defined, and is equal to\n    $f_B(b_1, \\ldots, b_n)$.\n\n2.  $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a *relative subalgebra* of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ if\n    $B\\subseteq A$, and $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ is a for every operator\n    symbol $f\\in \\tau$.\n\n    In words, $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a relative subalgebra of\n    $\\boldsymbol{A}$ iff $B\\subseteq A$, and for each $n$-ary symbol\n    $f\\in \\tau$, given $b_1,\\ldots, b_n \\in B$, $f_B(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$\n    is defined iff $f_A(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is and belongs to $B$, and\n    they are equal.\n\n3.  $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a *subalgebra* of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ if\n    $B\\subseteq A$, and $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ is a of\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ for every operator symbol $f\\in \\tau$.\n\n    In words, $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a subalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ iff\n    $B\\subseteq A$, and for each $n$-ary symbol $f\\in \\tau$, given\n    $b_1,\\ldots, b_n \\in B$, $f_B(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined iff\n    $f_A(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is, and they are equal.\n\nNotice that if $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a weak subalgebra of\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$, then every constant of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a constant\nof $\\boldsymbol{A}$, and vice versa.\n\nEvery subalgebra is a relative subalgebra, and every relative subalgebra\nis a weak subalgebra. But the converse is false for both statements.\nBelow are two examples.\n\n1.  Let $F$ be a field. Then every subalgebra of $F$ is a subfield, and\n    every relative subalgebra of $F$ is a subring.\n\n2.  Let $A$ be the set of all non-negative integers, and $-_A$ the\n    ordinary subtraction on integers. Consider the partial algebra\n    $(A, -_A)$.\n\n    -   Let $B=A$ and $-_B$ the usual subtraction on integers, but\n        $x-_B y$ is only defined when $x,y\\in B$ have the same parity.\n        Then $(B, -_B)$ is a weak subalgebra of $(A, -_A)$.\n\n    -   Let $C$ be the set of all positive integers, and $-_C$ the\n        ordinary subtraction. Then $(C,-_C)$ is a relative subalgebra of\n        $(A,-_A)$.\n\n    -   Let $D$ be the set $\\lbrace 0,1,\\ldots, n\\rbrace$ and $-_D$ the\n        ordinary subtraction. Then $(D,-_D)$ is a subalgebra of\n        $(A,-_A)$.\n\n    Notice that $(B,-_B)$ is not a relative subalgebra of $(A,-_A)$,\n    since $7-_B 6$ is not defined, even though $7 -A 6 = 1\\in B$, and\n    and $(C,-_C)$ is not a subalgebra of $(A,-_A)$, since $1 -_C 1$ is\n    not defined in $C$, even though $1 -A 1$ is defined in $A$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  A weak subalgebra $\\boldsymbol{B}$ of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is a relative\n    subalgebra iff given $b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\in B$ such that\n    $f_A(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined and is in $B$, then\n    $f_B(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined. A relative subalgebra\n    $\\boldsymbol{B}$ of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is a subalgebra iff whenever\n    $f_A(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined for $b_i\\in B$, it is in $B$.\n\n2.  Let $\\boldsymbol{A}$ be a partial algebra of type $\\tau$, and\n    $B\\subseteq A$. For each $n$-ary function symbol $f\\in \\tau$, define\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ on $B$ as follows:\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined in $B$ iff\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)$ is defined in $A$ and\n    $f_{\\boldsymbol{A}}(b_1,\\ldots, b_n)\\in B$. This turns\n    $\\boldsymbol{B}$ into a partial algebra. However, $\\boldsymbol{B}$\n    may not be of type $\\tau$, since $f_{\\boldsymbol{B}}$ may not be\n    defined at all on $B$. When $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is a partial algebra of\n    type $\\tau$, it is a relative subalgebra of $\\boldsymbol{A}$.\n\n3.  When $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is an algebra, all three notions of\n    subalgebras are equivalent (assuming that the partial operations on\n    a weak subalgebra are all total).\n\n[7]{} G.
