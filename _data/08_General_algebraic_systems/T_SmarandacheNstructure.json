  "definition": "In any of knowledge, a *Smarandache* $n$-*structure*, for\n$n \\geqslant 2$, on a set $S$ means a weak structure $w_0$ on $S$ such\nthat there exists a chain of proper subsets\n$P_{n-1} \\subset P_{n-2} \\subset \\cdots \\subset  P_2 \\subset P_1 \\subset  S$\nwhose corresponding structures satisfy the inverse inclusion chain\n$w_{n-1} \\succ w_{n-2} \\succ \\dots \\succ w_2 \\succ w_1 \\succ w_0$, where\n$\\succ$ signifies strictly stronger (i.e., structure satisfying more\naxioms).\n\nBy *proper subset* one understands a subset different from the empty\nset, from the idempotent if any, and from the whole set.\n\nNow one defines the *weak structure*:\n\nLet $A$ be a set, $B$ a proper subset of it, $\\phi$ an operation on $A$,\nand $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_{k+m}$ be $k+m$\nindependent axioms, where $k, m \\geqslant 1$. If the operation $\\phi$ on\nthe set $A$ satisfies the axioms $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ and does not\nsatisfy the axioms $a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_{k+m}$, while on the subset $B$\nthe operation $\\phi$ satisfies the axioms\n$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_{k+m}$, one says that\nstructure $w_A=(A, \\phi)$ is *weaker* than structure $w_B=(B, \\phi)$ and\none writes $w_A \\prec w_B$, or one says that $w_B$ is *stronger* than\nstructure $w_A$ and one writes $w_B \\succ w_A$. But if $\\phi$ satisfies\nthe same axioms on $A$ as on $B$ one says that structures $w_A$ and\n$w_B$ are equal and one writes $w_A=w_B$. When $\\phi$ satisfies the same\naxioms or less axioms on $A$ than on $B$ one says that structures $w_A$\nis *weaker than or equal* to structure $w_B$ and one writes\n$w_A \\preceq w_B$, or $w_B$ is *stronger than or equal* to $w_B$ and one\nwrites $w_B \\succeq w_A$. For example a semigroup is a structure weaker\nthan a group structure.\n\nThis definition can be extended to structures with many operations\n$(A, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_r)$ for $r \\geqslant 2$. Thus, let $A$\nbe a set and $B$ a proper subset of it. a) If\n$(A, \\phi_{i}) \\preceq (B, \\phi_{i})$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq r$, then\n$(A, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_r) \\preceq (B, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_r)$.\nb) If $\\exists i_0 \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, r\\}$ such that\n$(A, \\phi_{i_0}) \\prec (B, \\phi_{i_0})$ and\n$(A, \\phi_i) \\preceq (B, \\phi_i)$ for all $i \\ne i_0$, then\n$(A, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_r) \\prec (B, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_r)$.\nIn this case, for two operations, a ring is a structure weaker than a\nfield structure.\n\nThis definition comprises large classes of structures, some more\nimportant than others.\n\nAs a particular case, in abstract algebra, a *Smarandache 2-algebraic\nstructure* (two levels only of structures in algebra) on a set $S$, is a\nweak algebraic structure $w_0$ on $S$ such that there exists a proper\nsubset $P$ of $S$, which is embedded with a stronger algebraic structure\n$w_1$. For example: a *Smarandache semigroup* is a semigroup (different\nfrom a group) which has a proper subset that is a group. Other examples:\na *Smarandache groupoid of first order* is a groupoid (different from a\nsemigroup) which has a proper subset that is a semigroup, while a\n*Smarandache groupoid of second order* is a groupoid (different from a\nsemigroup) which has a proper subset that is a group.
