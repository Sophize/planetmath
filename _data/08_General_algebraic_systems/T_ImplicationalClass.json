  "definition": "In this entry, we extend the notion of an equational class (or a\nvariety) to a more general notion known as an implicational class (or a\nquasivariety). Recall that an equational class $K$ is a class of\nalgebraic systems satisfying a set $\\Sigma$ of \u201cequations\u201d and that $K$\nis the smallest class satisfying $\\Sigma$. Typical examples are the\nvarieties of groups, rings, or lattices.\n\nAn implicational class, loosely speaking, is the *smallest* class of\nalgebraic systems satisfying a set of \u201cimplications\u201d, where an\nimplication has the form $P\\to Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are some sentences.\nFormally, we define an *equational implication* in an algebraic system\nto be a sentence of the form\n$$(\\forall x_1)\\cdots (\\forall x_n)(e_1\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_p \\to e_q),$$\nwhere each $e_i$ is an identity of the form\n$f_i(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=g_i(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ for some $n$-ary polynomials\n$f_i$ and $g_i$, and $i=1,\\ldots,p,q$.\n\n**Definition**. A class $K$ of algebraic systems of the same type\n(signature) is called an *implicational class* if there is a set\n$\\Sigma$ of equational implications such that\n$$K=\\lbrace A \\mbox{ is a structure }\\mid A \\mbox{ is a model in } \\Sigma\\rbrace=\\lbrace A\\mid (\\forall q\\in \\Sigma)\\to (A\\models q)\\rbrace.$$\n\n**Examples**\n\n1.  Any equational class is implicational. Each identity $p=q$ can be\n    thought of as an equational implication $(p=p)\\to (p=q)$. In other\n    words, every algebra satisfying the identity also satisfies the\n    corresponding equational implication, and vice versa.\n\n2.  The class of all Dedekind-finite rings. In addition to satisfying\n    the identities for being a (unital) ring, each ring also satisfies\n    the equational implication\n    $$(\\forall x)(\\forall y)(xy=1)\\to (yx=1).$$\n\n3.  The class of all cancellation semigroups. In addition to satisfying\n    the identities for being a semigroup, each semigroup also satisfies\n    the implications\n    $$(\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\forall z)(xy=xz)\\to (y=z)\\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad (\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\forall z)(yx=zx)\\to (y=z).$$\n\n4.  The class $K$ of all torsion free abelian groups. In addition to\n    satisfying the identities for being abelian groups, each group also\n    satisfies the set of all implications\n    $$\\lbrace \\forall x (nx=0)\\to (x=0) \\mid n \\mbox{ is a positive integer}\\rbrace.$$\n\nThere is an equivalent formulation of an implicational class. Again, let\n$K$ be a class of algebraic systems of the same type (signature) $\\tau$.\nDefine the following four \u201coperations\u201d on *the* classes of algebraic\nsystems of type $\\tau$:\n\n1.  $I(K)$ is the class of all isomorphic copies of algebras in $K$,\n\n2.  $S(K)$ is the class of all subalgebras of algebras in $K$,\n\n3.  $P(K)$ is the class of all product of algebras in $K$ (including the\n    empty products, which means $P(K)$ includes the trivial algebra),\n    and\n\n4.  $U(K)$ is the class of all ultraproducts of algebras in $K$.\n\nSuppose $X$ is any one of the operations above, we say that $K$ is\n*closed* under operation $X$ if $X(K)\\subseteq K$.\n\n**Definition**. $K$ is said to be an *algebraic class* if $K$ is closed\nunder $I$, and $K$ is said to be a *quasivariety* if it is algebraic and\nis closed under $S,P,U$.\n\nIt can be shown that a class $K$ of algebraic systems of the same type\nis implicational iff it is a quasivariety. Therefore, we may use the two\nterms interchangeably.\n\nAs we have seen earlier, a variety is a quasivariety. However, the\nconverse is not true, as can be readily seen in the last example above,\nsince a homomorphic image of a torsion free abelian is in general not\ntorsion free: the homomorphic image of\n$\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_n$,\nhence not torsion free.",
