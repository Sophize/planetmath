  "definition": "A function of one variable is said to be *algebraic* if it satisfies a\npolynomial equation whose coefficients are polynomials in the same\nvariable. Namely, the function $f(x)$ is algebraic if $y=f(x)$ is a\nsolution of an equation of the form\n$$p_n(x) y^n + \\cdots + p_1(x) y + p_0(x) = 0,$$ where the\n$p_0(x), p_1(x), \\ldots, p_n(x)$ are polynomials in $x$. A function that\nsatisfies no such equation is said to be *transcendental*.\n\nThe graph of an algebraic function is an *algebraic curve*, which is,\nloosely speaking, the zero set of a polynomial in two variables.\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n--------\n\nAny rational function $f(x) = P(x)/Q(x)$ is algebraic, since $y=f(x)$ is\na solution to $Q(x)y - P(x) = 0$.\n\nThe function $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ is algebraic, since $y=f(x)$ is a solution\nto $y^2 - x = 0$. The same is true for any power function $x^{n/m}$,\nwith $n$ and $m$ integers, it satisfies the equation $y^m-x^n=0$.\n\nIt is known that the functions $e^x$ and $\\ln x$ are transcendental.\nMany special functions, such as Bessel functions, elliptic integrals,\nand others are known to be transcendental.\n\n**Remark**. There is also a version of an algebraic function defined on\nalgebraic systems. Given an algebraic system $A$, an *$n$-ary algebraic\nfunction* on $A$ is an $n$-ary operator $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ on $A$ such\nthat there is an $p(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1},\\ldots, x_{n+m})$ on $A$ for\nsome non-negative integer $m$, and elements $a_1,\\ldots, a_m\\in A$ such\nthat $$f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = p(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,a_1,\\ldots, a_m).$$\n\nEquivalently, given an algebraic system $A$, if we associate each\nelement $a$ of $A$ a corresponding symbol, also written $a$, we may form\nan algebraic system $A'$ from $A$ by adjoining every symbol $a$ to the\ntype of $A$ considered as a unary operator symbol, and leaving\neverything else the same. Then an algebraic function on $A$ is just a\npolynomial on $A'$ (and vice versa).\n\nFor example, in a ring $R$, a function $f$ on $R$ given by\n$f(x)=a_nx^n+\\cdots + a_1x+a_0$ where $a_i\\in R$ is a unary algebraic\nfunction on $R$, as $f(x)=p(x,a_0,\\ldots,a_n)$, where $p$ is an\n$(n+2)$-ary polynomial on $R$ given by\n$p(x,x_0,\\ldots,x_n)=x_nx^n+\\cdots + x_1x+x_0$.\n\n[9]{} G.
