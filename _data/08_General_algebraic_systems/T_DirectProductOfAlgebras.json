  "definition": "In this entry, let $O$ be a fixed operator set. All algebraic systems\nhave the same type (they are all $O$-algebras).\n\nLet $\\lbrace A_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be a set of algebraic systems of the\nsame type ($O$) indexed by $I$. Let us form the Cartesian product of the\nunderlying sets and call it $A$: $$A:=\\prod_{i\\in I} A_i.$$ Recall that\nelement $a$ of $A$ is a function from $I$ to $\\bigcup A_i$ such that for\neach $i\\in I$, $a(i)\\in A_i$.\n\nFor each $\\omega\\in O$ with arity $n$, let $\\omega_{A_i}$ be the\ncorresponding $n$-ary operator on $A_i$. Define $\\omega_A: A^n\\to A$ by\n$$\\omega_A(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)(i)=\\omega_{A_i}(a_1(i),\\ldots,a_n(i))\\quad\\mbox{ for all }i\\in I.$$\nOne readily checks that $\\omega_A$ is a well-defined $n$-ary operator on\n$A$. $A$ equipped with all $\\omega_A$ on $A$ is an $O$-algebra, and is\ncalled the *direct product* of $A_i$. Each $A_i$ is called a *direct\nfactor* of $A$.\n\nIf each $A_i=B$, where $B$ is an $O$-algebra, then we call $A$ the\ndirect power of $B$ and we write $A$ as $B^I$ (keep in mind the\nisomorphic identifications).\n\nIf $A$ is the direct product of $A_i$, then for each $i\\in I$ we can\nassociate a homomorphism $\\pi_i:A\\to A_i$ called a *projection* given by\n$\\pi_i(a)=a(i)$. It is a homomorphism because\n$\\pi_i(\\omega_A(a_1,\\ldots, a_n))=\\omega_A(a_1,\\ldots, a_n)(i)=\\omega_{A_i}(a_1(i),\\ldots,a_n(i))=\\omega_{A_i}(\\pi_i(a_1),\\ldots, \\pi_i(a_n))$.\n\n**Remark**. The direct product of a single algebraic system is the\nalgebraic system itself. An *empty direct product* is defined to be a\ntrivial algebraic system (one-element algebra).",
