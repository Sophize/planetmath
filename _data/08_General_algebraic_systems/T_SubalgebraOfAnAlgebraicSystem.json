  "definition": "Let $(A,O)$ be an algebraic system ($A\\ne \\varnothing$ is the underlying\nset and $O$ is the set of operators on $A$).\n\n**Subalgebras of an Algebra**\n\nLet $B$ be a non-empty subset of $A$. $B$ is *closed* under operators of\n$A$ if for each $n$-ary operator $\\omega_A$ on $A$, and any\n$b_1,\\ldots,b_n\\in B$, we have $\\omega_A(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\in B$.\n\nSuppose $B$ is closed under operators of $A$. For each $n$-ary operator\n$\\omega_A$ on $A$, we define $\\omega_B:B^n\\to B$ by\n$\\omega_B(b_1,\\ldots,b_n):= \\omega_A(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$. Each of these\noperators is well-defined and is called a *restriction* (of the\ncorresponding $\\omega_A$). Furthermore, $(B,O)$ is a well-defined\nalgebraic system, and is called the *subalgebra* of $(A,O)$. When\n$(B,O)$ is a subalgebra of $(A,O)$, we also say that $(A,O)$ is an\n*extension* of $(B,O)$.\n\n$(A,O)$ is clearly a subalgebra of itself. Any other subalgebra of\n$(A,O)$ is called a *proper subalgebra*.\n\n**Remark**. If $(A,O)$ contains constants, then any subalgebra of\n$(A,O)$ must contain the exact same constants. For example, the ring\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ of integers is an algebraic system with no proper\nsubalgebras. Indeed, if $R$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{Z}$, $1\\in R$, so\n$R=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince we are operating under the same operator set, we can, for\nconvenience, drop $O$ and simply call $A$ an algebra, $B$ a subalgebra\nof $A$, etc... If $B_1,B_2$ are subalgebras of $A$, then $B_1\\cap B_2$\nis also a subalgebra. In fact, given any set of subalgebras $B_i$ of\n$A$, their intersection $\\bigcap B_i$ is also a subalgebra.\n\n**Generating Set of an Algebra**\n\nLet $C$ be any subset of an algebra $A$. Consider the collection $[C]$\nof all subalgebras of $A$ containing $C$. This collection is non-empty\nbecause $A\\in [C]$. The intersection of all these subalgebras is again a\nsubalgebra containing the set $C$. Denote this subalgebra by\n$\\langle C\\rangle$. $\\langle C\\rangle$ is called the subalgebra\n*spanned* by $C$, and $C$ is called the *spanning set* of\n$\\langle C\\rangle$. Conversely, any subalgebra $B$ of $A$ has a spanning\nset, namely itself: $B=\\langle B\\rangle$.\n\nGiven a subalgebra $B$ of $A$, a minimal spanning set $X$ of $B$ is\ncalled a *generating set* of $B$. By minimal we mean that the set\nobtained by deleting any element from $X$ no longer spans $B$. When $B$\nhas a generating set $X$, we also say that $X$ *generates* $B$. If $B$\ncan be generated by a finite set, we say that $B$ is *finitely\ngenerated*. If $B$ can be generated by a single element, we say that $B$\nis *cyclic*.\n\n**Remark**. $\\langle \\varnothing\\rangle =$ the subalgebra generated by\nthe constants of $A$. If no such constants exist,\n$\\langle \\varnothing \\rangle :=\\varnothing$.\n\nFrom the discussion above, the set of subalgebras of an algebraic system\nforms a complete lattice. Given subalgebras $A_i$, $\\bigvee A_i$ is the\nintersection of all $A_i$, and $\\bigvee A_i$ is the subalgebra\n$\\langle \\bigcup A_i\\rangle$. The lattice of all subalgebras of $A$ is\ncalled the *subalgebra latttice* of $A$, and is denoted by\n$\\operatorname{Sub}(A)$.",
