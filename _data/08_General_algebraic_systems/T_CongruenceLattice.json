  "definition": "The set $\\operatorname{Con}(A)$ of all congruences on an algebraic\nsystem $A$ is a complete lattice that is a sublattice (called the\n*congruence lattice* of $A$) of the lattice of equivalence relations on\n$A$.\n\nIt is not hard to see that ${\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$ is a topped\nintersection structure. As a result, ${\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$ is a\ncomplete lattice. Since it is also a subset of the lattice $E(A)$ of\nequivalence relations on $A$, the only remaining item to show is that it\nis a sublattice of $E(A)$. In other words, we need to show that if\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is a family of congruence relations on $A$, so is\n$\\Theta:=\\bigvee \\mathcal{C}$.\n\nFor convenience, let us introduce some notational devices:\n\n-   $\\mathbf{n}:=\\lbrace 1,\\ldots,n\\rbrace$;\n\n-   for any $a_k,b_k\\in A$ and $\\Theta_k\\in{\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$,\n    where $k\\in \\mathbf{n}$, we mean\n    $$(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\equiv (b_1,\\ldots, b_n)\\pmod{(\\Theta_1,\\ldots,\\Theta_n)}$$\n    by $a_k\\equiv b_k\\pmod {\\Theta_k}$, for each $k\\in \\mathbf{n}$;\n\n-   $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\equiv (b_1,\\ldots, b_n)\\pmod{\\Theta}$ means\n    $a_k\\equiv b_k\\pmod \\Theta$, for each $k\\in \\mathbf{n}$;\n\n-   Finally, when $c_k\\equiv c_{k+1}\\pmod {\\Theta_k}$, where\n    $k\\in \\mathbf{n-1}$, we write\n    $$c_1\\stackrel{\\Theta_1}{\\equiv} c_2\\stackrel{\\Theta_2}{\\equiv} \\cdots \\stackrel{\\Theta_{n-1}}{\\equiv }c_n.$$\n    Let us call this an (of $n$).\n\nBack to the proof. Let $\\omega$ be an $n$-ary operator on $A$ and\n$(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\equiv (b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\pmod \\Theta$. We want to show\nthat $\\omega(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\equiv \\omega(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\pmod \\Theta$.\n\nThe proof now breaks up into two main steps:\n\nFor each $i\\in \\mathbf{n}$, $a_i\\equiv b_i\\pmod \\Theta$ means we have a\nfinite\n$$a_i=c_1\\stackrel{F_1}{\\equiv} c_2\\stackrel{F_2}{\\equiv} \\cdots \\stackrel{F_{p-1}}{\\equiv }c_p=b_i,$$\nwhere each $F_i$ is a congruence in $\\mathcal{C}$, and each $c_i\\in A$.\nNow the lengths of the sequences may vary by $i$. The idea is to show\nthat we can in fact pick the sequences so that they all have the same\nlength.\n\nTo see this, take the first two pairs of congruent elements\n$a_1\\equiv b_1\\pmod \\Theta$ and $a_2\\equiv b_2\\pmod \\Theta$, and expand\nthem into two finite\n\n1.  $a_1=c_1\\stackrel{F_1}{\\equiv} c_2\\stackrel{F_2}{\\equiv} \\cdots \\stackrel{F_{p-1}}{\\equiv }c_p=b_1$,\n    and\n\n2.  $a_2=d_1\\stackrel{G_1}{\\equiv} d_2\\stackrel{G_2}{\\equiv} \\cdots \\stackrel{G_{q-1}}{\\equiv }d_q=b_2$,\n\nwhere $c_i,d_j\\in A$ and $F_i,G_j\\in \\mathcal{C}$. If $q<p$, we may\nlengthen the second chain so it has the same length as the first one:\n$$a_2=d_1\\stackrel{G_1}{\\equiv} d_2 \\cdots \\stackrel{G_{q-1}}{\\equiv }d_q \\stackrel{G_q}{\\equiv} d_{q+1}\\stackrel{G_{q+1}}{\\equiv} \\cdots \\stackrel{G_{p-1}}{\\equiv }d_p,$$\nwhere $G_{q-1}=G_q=\\cdots =G_{p-1}$ and $d_q=\\cdots=d_p=b$.\n\nThe above argument and an induction step on $n$ show that we can indeed\nmake all the \u201cexpanded\u201d the same length. As a result, without loss of\ngenerality, we assume that all the expanded chains have the same length,\nsay $r+1$.\n\nComplete the proof.\n\nInstead of writing all $n$ chains, let us use our notational device, and\nwe have the following *single* (again, we may write it in this fashion\nbecause all chains are now assumed to have the same finite length of\n$r+1$): $$\\xymatrix{\n(c_{11},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[rr]^-{(F_{11},\\ldots,F_{1n})} && (c_{21},\\ldots,c_{2n})\\ar@3{-}[rr]^-{(F_{21},\\ldots,F_{2n})} && \\cdots\\ar@3{-}[rr]^-{(F_{r1},\\ldots,F_{rn})} && (c_{r+1,1},\\ldots,c_{r+1,n})\n}$$ where each $c_{ij}\\in A$, each $F_{ij}\\in\\mathcal{C}$, with\n$(i,j)\\in (\\mathbf{r+1})\\times \\mathbf{n}$, and that\n$(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)=(c_{11},\\ldots,c_{1n})$ and\n$(c_{r+1,1},\\ldots,c_{r+1,n})=(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$.\n\nLook at the first congruence pair\n$\\xymatrix{(c_{11},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[rr]^-{(F_{11},\\ldots,F_{1n})} && (c_{21},\\ldots,c_{2n})}$.\nThis can be expanded into an of length $n$ as follows: $$\\xymatrix{\n(c_{11},c_{12},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{11}} & (c_{21},c_{12},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{12}} & \\cdots \\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{1n}} & (c_{21},c_{22},\\ldots,c_{2n})\n}$$ The idea is to replace the coordinates one at a time, in sequence,\nfrom the first to the last, until all $n$ coordinates are completely\nreplaced from $(c_{11},\\ldots, c_{1n})$ to $(c_{21},\\ldots,c_{2n})$.\n\nNow, since each $F_{1j}$ is a congruence, apply $\\omega$ to each\n$n$-tuple to get a new $$\\xymatrix{\n\\omega(c_{11},c_{12},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{11}} & \\omega(c_{21},c_{12},\\ldots,c_{1n})\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{12}} & \\cdots \\ar@3{-}[r]^-{F_{1n}} & \\omega(c_{21},c_{22},\\ldots,c_{2n})\n}.$$ But this chain implies that\n$\\omega(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)=\\omega(c_{11},\\ldots,c_{in})\\equiv \\omega(c_{21},\\ldots,c_{2n})\\pmod \\Theta$.\nSo what we have shown is that the images of the first congruence pair\nare congruent modulo $\\Theta$. But this process can be easily applied to\nsubsequent congruence pairs, so that we end up with $$\\xymatrix{\n\\omega(a_1,\\ldots,a_2)\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{\\Theta} & \\omega(c_{21},\\ldots,c_{2n})\\ar@3{-}[r]^-{\\Theta} & \\cdots \\ar@3{-}[r]^-{\\Theta} & \\omega(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\n}.$$ As $\\Theta$ is an equivalence relation,\n$\\omega(a_1,\\ldots,a_2)\\equiv \\omega(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\pmod \\Theta$,\ncompleting the proof.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Furthermore, it can be shown that ${\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$ is an\n    algebraic lattice. The compact elements of ${\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$\n    are finite joins of so-called *principal congruences*.\n\n-   Conversely, it can be shown (by Gr\u00e4tzer) that every algebraic\n    lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebraic\n    system.\n\n-   If $A$ is a lattice, then ${\\operatorname{Con}(A)}$ is distributive.\n    The converse statement, that every distributive algebraic lattice is\n    isomorphic to a congruence lattice, has recently been proven to be\n    false by F.
