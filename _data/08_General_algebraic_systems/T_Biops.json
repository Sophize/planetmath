  "definition": "Let $S$ be a set and $n \\in \\mathbf{N}$. Set\n$\\mathbf{N}_n := \\{i \\in \\mathbf{N} | i < n \\}$. If there exists a map\n$\\cdot : \\mathbf{N}_n \\to (S^2 \\to S) : i \\mapsto \\cdot_i$ where\n$\\cdot_i : S^2 \\to S : (a, b) \\mapsto a \\cdot_i b$ is a binary\noperation, then I shall say that $(S, \\cdot)$ is an *$n$-biops*. In\nother words, an $n$-biops is an algebraic system with $n$ binary\noperations defined on it, and the operations are labelled\n$0,1,\\ldots, n-1$.\n\nLet $(S, \\cdot)$ be an $n$-biops. If $\\cdot$ has the property $p$, then\nI shall say that $(S, \\cdot)$ is a $p$ $n$-biops.\n\nFor example if $(S, \\cdot)$ is an $n$-biops and $\\cdot$ is\n$0$-commutative, $0$-associative, $0$-alternative or\n$(0, 1)$-distributive, then I shall say that $(S, \\cdot)$ is a\n$0$-commutative $n$-biops, $0$-associative $n$-biops, $0$-alternative\n$n$-biops or $(0, 1)$-distributive $n$-biops respectively.\n\nIf an $n$-biops $B$ is $i$-$p$ for each $i \\in \\mathbf{N}_n$ then I\nshall say that $B$ is a $p$ $n$-biops.\n\nA $0$-associative $1$-biops is called a semigroup. A semigroup with\nidentity element is called a monoid. A monoid with inverses is called a\ngroup.\n\nA $(0, 1)$-distributive $2$-biops $(S, +, \\cdot)$, such that both\n$(S, +)$ and $(S, \\cdot)$ are monoids, is called a rig.\n\nA $(0, 1)$-distributive $2$-biops $(S, +, \\cdot)$, such that $(S, +)$ is\na group and $(S, \\cdot)$ is a monoid, is called a ring.\n\nA rig with $0$-inverses is a ring.\n\nA $0$-associative $2$-biops $(S, \\cdot, /)$ with $0$-identity such that\nfor every $\\{a, b\\} \\subset S$ we have\n$$b = (b / a) \\cdot a = (b \\cdot a) / a$$ is called a group.\n\nA $3$-biops $(S, \\cdot, /, \\backslash)$ such that for every\n$\\{a, b\\} \\subset S$ we have\n$$a \\backslash (a \\cdot b) = a \\cdot (a \\backslash b) = b = (b / a) \\cdot a = (b \\cdot a) / a$$\nis called a quasigroup.\n\nA quasigroup such that for every $\\{a, b\\} \\subset S$ we have\n$a / a = b \\backslash b$ is called a loop.\n\nA $0$-associative loop is a group.",
