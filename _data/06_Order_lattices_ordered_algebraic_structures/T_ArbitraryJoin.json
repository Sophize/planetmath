  "definition": "Let $P$ be a poset and $A\\subseteq P$. The *join* of $A$ is the supremum\nof $A$, if it exists. It is denoted by\n$$\\bigvee A \\qquad\\mbox{ or }\\qquad \\bigvee_{i\\in I}a_i\\qquad\\mbox{ or }\\qquad \\bigvee \\lbrace a_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace,$$\nif the elements of $A$ are indexed by a set $I$:\n$$A=\\lbrace a_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace.$$ In other words,\n$\\bigvee A = \\sup A$, where the equality is directed in the sense that\none side is defined iff the other side is, and when this is the case,\nboth sides are equal. Dually, one defines the *meet* of $A$ to be the\ninfimum of $A$, if it exists. The meet of $A$ is denoted by\n$\\bigwedge A$.\n\n**Remark**. The concepts of $\\bigvee$ and $\\sup$ of an ordered set are\nidentical. Besides being notationally distinct, $\\bigvee$ is often used\nin order theory, while $\\sup$ is more prevalent in analysis. Moreover,\n$\\bigvee$ is generally being viewed as a (partial) function on the\npowerset $2^P$ of the poset $P$, while $\\sup$ is frequently seen as an\noperation on sequences (or more generally nets) of elements of $P$.\n\n1.  As was remarked, given a poset $P$, let us view $\\bigvee: 2^P\\to P$\n    as a partial function. Then $\\bigvee$ is defined for all singletons.\n    In fact $\\bigvee \\lbrace a\\rbrace =a$ for all $a\\in P$. Dually,\n    $\\bigwedge \\lbrace a\\rbrace =a$.\n\n2.  If $\\bigvee$ is defined for all doubletons, then it is defined for\n    all finite subsets of $P$. In this case, $P$ is called a\n    join-semilattice. Dually, $P$ is a meet-semilattice is $\\bigwedge$\n    is defined for all doubletons.\n\n3.  If $A\\subseteq B$, then $\\bigvee A\\le \\bigvee B$, provided that both\n    joins exist. We also have a dual statement: $A\\subseteq B$ implies\n    that $\\bigwedge B\\le \\bigwedge A$, provided that both meets exist.\n\n4.  $\\bigvee \\varnothing$ exists iff $P$ has a bottom $0$, and when this\n    is the case, $\\bigvee \\varnothing=0$. This is essentially the result\n    of the previous bulleted statement. Dually, $P$ has a top $1$ iff\n    $\\bigwedge \\varnothing$ exists, and when this is the case\n    $\\bigwedge \\varnothing = 1$.\n\n5.  Simiarly $\\bigvee P=1$ and $\\bigwedge P=0$, where the equality is\n    directed on both sides.\n\n6.  It can be shown that if $\\bigvee$ is a total function from $2^P$ to\n    $P$, then $P$ is a complete lattice. (see proof ).\n\n7.  Let $P$ be a poset such that $\\bigvee$ is defined for all subsets\n    (of $P$) of cardinality $\\mathfrak{m}$, is it true that $\\bigvee$ is\n    defined for all subsets of cardinality $\\le \\mathfrak{m}$? The\n    answer is no, even when $\\mathfrak{m}$ is finite. A counterexample\n    can be constructed as follows. $$\\xymatrix @!=1pt {\n    & 1 \\ar@{.}[d] \\ar@{-}[rrdd] & & \\\\\n    & \\ar@{-}[rd] \\ar@{-}[ld] & &  \\\\\n    a & & b & c\n    }$$ Let $C$ be an infinite chain with a top element $1$ (this can be\n    found by taking the set of natural numbers and dualize the usual\n    order). Adjoin three elements $a,b,c$ to $C$ so that $a$ and $b$ are\n    below all elements of $C$, and $c$ is covered by $1$, and no two of\n    $a,b,c$ are comparable. This new poset $P$ has the property that any\n    three distinct elements have a join. For example,\n    $\\bigvee \\lbrace a,b,c\\rbrace = 1$. However,\n    $\\bigvee \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ does not exist.",
