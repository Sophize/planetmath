  "statement": "Let $P$ be a poset of height $h$. Then $P$ can be partitioned into $h$\nantichains and furthermore at least $h$ antichains are required.\n\nInduction on $h$. If $h=1$, then no elements of $P$ are comparable, so\n$P$ is an antichain. Now suppose that $P$ has height $h\\geq 2$ and that\nthe theorem is true for $h-1$. Let $A_1$ be the set of maximal elements\nof $P$. Then $A_1$ is an antichain in $P$ and $P-A_1$ has height $h-1$\nsince we have removed precisely one element from every chain. Hence,\n$P-A_1$ can be paritioned into $h-1$ antichains $A_2,A_3,\\dots A_h$. Now\nwe have the partition $A_1\\cup A_2\\cup\\dots\\cup A_h$ of $P$ into $h$\nantichains as desired.\n\nThe necessity of $h$ antichains is trivial by the pigeonhole principle;\nsince $P$ has height $h$, it has a chain of length $h$, and each element\nof this chain must be placed in a different antichain of our partition.",
