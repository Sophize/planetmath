  "definition": "A lattice $L$ is called a *generalized Boolean algebra* if\n\n-   $L$ is distributive,\n\n-   $L$ is relatively complemented, and\n\n-   $L$ has $0$ as the bottom.\n\nClearly, a Boolean algebra is a generalized Boolean algebra. Conversely,\na generalized Boolean algebra $L$ with a top $1$ is a Boolean algebra,\nsince $L=[0,1]$ is a bounded distributive complemented lattice, so each\nelement $a\\in L$ has a unique complement $a'$ by distributivity. So $'$\nis a unary operator on $L$ which makes $L$ into a de Morgan algebra. A\ncomplemented de Morgan algebra is, as a result, a Boolean algebra.\n\nAs an example of a generalized Boolean algebra that is not Boolean, let\n$A$ be an infinite set and let $B$ be the set of all finite subsets of\n$A$. Then $B$ is generalized Boolean: order $B$ by inclusion, then $B$\nis a distributive as the operation is inherited from $P(A)$, the\npowerset of $A$. It is also relatively complemented: if $C\\in [X,Y]$\nwhere $C,X,Y\\in B$, then $(Y-C)\\cup X$ is the relative complement of $C$\nin $[X,Y]$. Finally, $\\varnothing$ is, as usual, the bottom element in\n$B$. $B$ is not a Boolean algebra, because the union of all the\nsingletons (all in $B$) is $A$, which is infinite, thus not in $B$.\n\nOne property of a generalized Boolean algebra $L$ is the following: if\n$y$ and $z$ are complements of $x\\in [a,b]$, then $y=z$; in other words,\nrelative complements are uniquely determined. This is true because in\nany distributive lattice, complents are uniquely determined. As $L$ is\ndistributive, so is each lattice interval $[a,b]$ in $L$.\n\nIn fact, because of the existence of $0$, we can actually construct the\nrelative complement. Let $b-x$ denote the unique complement of $x$ in\n$[0,b]$. Then $(b-x)\\vee a$ is the unique complement of $x\\in [a,b]$:\n$x\\wedge ((b-x)\\vee a)=(x\\wedge (b-x))vee (x\\wedge a)=0\\vee a=a$ and\n$x\\vee ((b-x)\\vee a)=(x\\vee (b-x))\\vee a=b\\vee a=b$.\n\nConversely, if $L$ is a distributive lattice with $0$ such that any\nlattice interval $[0,a]$ is complemented, then $L$ is a generalized\nBoolean algebra. Again, $(b-x)\\vee a$ provides the necessary complement\nof $x$ in $[a,b]$.",
