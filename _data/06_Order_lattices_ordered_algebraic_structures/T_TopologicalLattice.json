  "definition": "A *topological lattice* is a lattice $L$ equipped with a topology\n$\\mathcal{T}$ such that the meet and join operations from $L\\times L$\n(with the product topology) to $L$ are continuous.\n\nLet $(x_i)_{i\\in I}$ be a net in $L$. We say that $(x_i)$ converges to\n$x\\in L$ if $(x_i)$ is eventually in any open neighborhood of $x$, and\nwe write $x_i\\to x$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   If $(x_i)$ and $(y_j)$ are nets, indexed by $I,J$ respectively, then\n    $(x_i\\wedge y_j)$ and $(x_i\\vee y_j)$ are nets, both indexed by\n    $I\\times J$. This is clear, and is stated in preparation for the\n    proposition below.\n\n-   If $x_i\\to x$ and $y_j\\to y$, then $x_i\\wedge y_j\\to x\\wedge y$ and\n    $x_i \\vee y_j\\to x\\vee y$.\n\n    Let\u2019s show the first convergence, and the other one follows\n    similarly. The function $f:x\\mapsto (x,y) \\mapsto x\\wedge y$ is a\n    continuous function, being the composition of two continuous\n    functions. If $x\\wedge y\\in U$ is open, then $x\\in f^{-1}(U)$ is\n    open. As $x_i\\to x$, there is an $i_0 \\in I$ such that\n    $x_i\\in f^{-1}(U)$ for all $i\\ge i_0$, which means that\n    $x_i\\wedge y=f(x_i)\\in U$. By the same token, for each $i\\in I$, the\n    function $g_i: y\\mapsto (x_i,y)\\mapsto x_i\\wedge y$ is a continuous\n    function. Since $x_i\\wedge y\\in U$ is open, $y\\in g^{-1}(U)$ is\n    open. As $y_j\\to y$, there is a $j_0\\in J$ such that\n    $y_j\\in g^{-1}(U)$ for all $j\\ge j_0$, or\n    $x_i\\wedge y_j=g_i(y_j) \\in U$, for all $i\\ge i_0$ and $j\\ge j_0$.\n    Hence $x_i\\wedge y_j\\to x\\wedge y$.\n\n-   For any net $(x_i)$, the set $A=\\lbrace a\\in L \\mid x_i\\to a\\rbrace$\n    is a sublattice of $L$.\n\n    If $a,b\\in A$, then $x_i=x_i\\wedge x_i\\to a\\wedge b$. So\n    $a\\wedge b\\in A$. Similarly $a\\vee b\\in A$.\n\nThere are two approaches to finding examples of topological lattices.\nOne way is to start with a topological space $X$ such that $X$ is\npartially ordered, then find two continuous binary operations on $X$ to\nform the meet and join operations of a lattice. The real numbers\n$\\mathbb{R}$, with operations defined by\n$a\\wedge b= \\operatorname{inf}\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ and\n$a\\vee b =\\operatorname{sup}\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$, is one such an example.\nThis can be easily generalized to the space of real-valued continuous\nfunctions, since, given any two real-valued continuous functions $f$ and\n$g$, $$f\\vee g:=\\max(f,g)\\mbox{ and }f\\wedge g:=\\min(f,g)$$ are\nwell-defined real-valued continuous functions as well (in fact, it is\nenough to say that for any continuous function $f$, its absolute value\n$|f|$ is also continuous, so that $$\\max(f,0)=\\frac{1}{2}(f+|f|),$$ and\nthus $$\\max(f,g)= \\max(f-g,0)+g\\mbox{ and }\\min(f,g)=f+g-\\max(f,g)$$ are\nboth continuous as well).\n\nThe second approach is to start with a general lattice $L$ and define a\ntopology $\\mathcal{T}$ on the subsets of the underlying set of $L$, with\nthe hope that both $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ are continuous under\n$\\mathcal{T}$. The obvious example using this second approach is to take\nthe discrete topology of the underlying set. Another way is to impose\nconditions, such as requiring that the lattice be meet and join\ncontinuous. Of course, finding a topology on the underlying set of a\nlattice may not guarantee a topological lattice.",
