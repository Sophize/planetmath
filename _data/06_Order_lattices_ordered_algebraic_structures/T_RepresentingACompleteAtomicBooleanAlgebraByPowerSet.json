  "definition": "It is a known fact that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field\nof sets (of some set) (proof ). In this entry, we show that,\nfurthermore, if a Boolean algebra is atomic and complete, then it is\nisomorphic to *the* field of sets of some set, in other words, the\npowerset of some set, viewed as a Boolean algebra via the usual\nset-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement.\n\nThe proof is based on the following function, defined for any atomic\nBoolean algebra:\n\n**Definition**. Let $B$ be an atomic Boolean algebra, and $X$ *the* set\nof its atoms. Define $f: B\\to P(X)$ by\n$$f(x):=\\lbrace a \\mid a\\le x \\rbrace.$$\n\nIt is easy to see that $f(x)=\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ iff $x$ is an atom of\n$B$.\n\n$f(x)$ and $f(x')$ are complement of one another in $X$.\n\nFor any $a\\in X$, $a\\le 1=x\\vee x'$, so that $a\\le x$ or $a\\le x'$, or\n$a\\in f(x)$ or $a\\in f(x')$. This shows that $f(x)\\cup f(x')=X$. If\n$a\\in f(x)\\cap f(x')$, then $a\\le x$ and $a\\le x'$, so that\n$a\\le x\\wedge x'=0$, which is impossible, since $a$ is an atom, and by\ndefinition, must be greater than $0$.\n\n$f$ is a Boolean algebra homomorphism.\n\nFirst, $f(x') = X-f(x)$ by the last proposition.\n\nNext,\n$f(x\\vee y)= \\lbrace a \\mid a\\le x\\vee y \\rbrace = \\lbrace a \\mid a\\le x \\mbox{ or } a\\le y\\rbrace$\nsince $a$ is an atom. But the right hand side equals\n$\\lbrace a\\mid a\\le x\\rbrace \\cup \\lbrace a\\mid a\\le y \\rbrace = f(x)\\cup f(y)$,\nwe see that $f$ preserves $\\vee$.\n\nFinally, $f(0)=\\lbrace a\\mid a\\le 0\\rbrace = \\varnothing$ since any atom\nmust be greater than $0$.\n\nHence, $f$ is a Boolean algebra homomorphism.\n\n$f$ is an injection.\n\nSuppose $f(x)=\\varnothing$. If $x\\ne 0$, then there must be some atom\n$a$ such that $a\\le x$. But this implies that $f(x)\\ne \\varnothing$, a\ncontradiction. Hence $x=0$ and $f$ is injective.\n\n$f$ is conditionally complete, in the sense that if $\\bigvee A$ is\ndefined for any $A\\subseteq B$, then\n$$f(\\bigvee A)=\\bigcup \\lbrace f(x)\\mid x\\in A\\rbrace.$$\n\nSuppose $y=\\bigvee A$ and $Y=f(y)$. Let\n$Z=\\bigcup \\lbrace f(x) \\mid x\\in A \\rbrace$. We want to show that\n$Y=Z$. If $a\\in Y$, then $a\\le y$, or $a\\le x$ for some $x \\in A$, since\n$a$ is an atom. So $a\\in f(x)\\subseteq Z$. Conversely, if $a\\in Z$, then\n$a\\in f(x)$, or $a\\le x$ for some $x\\in A$. This means that\n$a\\le x \\le \\bigvee A =y$, and therefore $a\\in f(y)=Y$.\n\nIf $B$ is complete, so is $f$. Moreover, $f$ is surjective.\n\nThe first sentence is a direct consequence of the previous proposition.\nFor the second setnence, let $Y\\in P(X)$. Let $y=\\bigvee Y$. $x$ exists\nbecause $B$ is complete. So\n$f(y)=f(\\bigvee Y) = \\bigcup \\lbrace f(x) \\mid x \\in Y \\rbrace = \\bigcup \\lbrace \\lbrace x\\rbrace \\mid x\\in Y\\rbrace = Y$,\nsince each $x\\in Y$ is an atom.\n\nRewording the above proposition, we have\n\nAny complete atomic Boolean algebra is isomorphic (as complete Boolean\nalgebras) to the powerset of some set, namely, the set of all of its\natoms.\n\nA useful application of this representation theorem is the following:\n\nThe cardinality of a finite Boolean algebra is a power of $2$.\n\nEvery finite Boolean algebra is complete and atomic, and hence\nisomorphic to the powerset of a set, which is also finite, and the\nresult follows.\n\n**Remark**. The proof does not depend on the representation of a Boolean\nalgebra by a field of sets.",
