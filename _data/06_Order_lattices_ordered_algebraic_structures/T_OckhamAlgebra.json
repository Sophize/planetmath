  "definition": "A lattice $L$ is called an *Ockham algebra* if\n\n1.  $L$ is distributive\n\n2.  $L$ is bounded, with $0$ as the bottom and $1$ as the top\n\n3.  there is a unary operator $\\neg$ on $L$ with the following\n    properties:\n\n    1.  $\\neg$ satisfies the de Morgan\u2019s laws; this means that:\n\n        -   $\\neg (a\\vee b)=\\neg a\\wedge \\neg b$ and\n\n        -   $\\neg (a\\wedge b)=\\neg a\\vee \\neg b$\n\n    2.  $\\neg 0=1$ and $\\neg 1=0$\n\nSuch a unary operator is an example of a dual endomorphism. When\napplied, $\\neg$ interchanges the operations of $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$, and\n$0$ and $1$.\n\nAn Ockham algebra is a generalization of a Boolean algebra, in the sense\nthat $\\neg$ replaces $'$, the complement operator, on a Boolean algebra.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   An intermediate concept is that of a De Morgan algebra, which is an\n    Ockham algebra with the additional requirement that\n    $\\neg (\\neg a)=a$.\n\n-   In the category of Ockham algebras, the morphism between any two\n    objects is a $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$- $f$ that preserves $\\neg$:\n    $f(\\neg a)=\\neg f(a)$. In fact, $f(0)=f(\\neg 1)=\\neg f(1)=\\neg 1=0$,\n    so that it is safe to drop the assumption that $f$ preserves $0$.\n\n[8]{} T.S. Blyth, J.C.
