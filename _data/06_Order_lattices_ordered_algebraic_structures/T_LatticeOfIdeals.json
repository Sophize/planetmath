  "definition": "Let $R$ be a ring. Consider the set $L(R)$ of all left ideals of $R$.\nOrder this set by inclusion, and we have a partially ordered set. In\nfact, we have the following:\n\n$L(R)$ is a complete lattice.\n\nFor any collection $S=\\lbrace J_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ of (left) ideals of\n$R$ ($I$ is an index set), define\n$$\\bigwedge S:=\\bigcap S\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad\\bigvee S=\\sum_i J_i,$$\nthe sum of ideals $J_i$. We assert that $\\bigwedge S$ is the greatest\nlower bound of the $J_i$, and $\\bigvee S$ the least upper bound of the\n$J_i$, and we show these facts separately\n\n-   First, $\\bigwedge S$ is a left ideal of $R$: if\n    $a,b\\in \\bigwedge S$, then $a,b\\in J_i$ for all $i\\in I$.\n    Consequently, $a-b\\in J_i$ and so $a-b\\in \\bigwedge S$. Furthermore,\n    if $r\\in R$, then $ra\\in J_i$ for any $i\\in I$, so\n    $ra\\in \\bigwedge S$ also. Hence $\\bigwedge S$ is a left ideal. By\n    construction, $\\bigwedge S$ is clearly contained in all of $J_i$,\n    and is clearly the largest such ideal.\n\n-   For the second part, we want to show that $\\bigvee S$ actually\n    exists for arbitrary $S$. We know the existence of $\\bigvee S$ if\n    $S$ is finite. Suppose now $S$ is infinite. Define $J$ to be the set\n    of finite sums of elements of $\\bigcup_i J_i$. If $a,b\\in J$, then\n    $a+b$, being a finite sum itself, clearly belongs to $J$. Also,\n    $-a\\in J$ as well, since the additive inverse of each of the\n    additive components of $a$ is an element of $\\bigcup_i J_i$. Now, if\n    $r\\in R$, then $ra\\in J$ too, since multiplying each additive\n    component of $a$ by $r$ (on the left) lands back in $\\bigcup_i J_i$.\n    So $J$ is a left ideal. It is evident that $J_i\\subseteq J$. Also,\n    if $M$ is a left ideal containing each $J_i$, then any finite sum of\n    elements of $J_i$ must also be in $M$, hence $J\\subseteq M$. This\n    implies that $J$ is the smallest ideal containing each of the $J_i$.\n    Therefore $S$ exists and is equal to $J$.\n\nIn summary, both $\\bigvee S$ and $\\bigwedge S$ are well-defined, and\nexist for finite $S$, so $L(R)$ is a lattice. Additionally, both\noperations work for arbitrary $S$, so $L(R)$ is complete.\n\nFrom the above proof, we see that the sum $S$ of ideals $J_i$ can be\nequivalently interpreted as\n\n-   the \u201cideal\u201d of finite sums of the elements of $J_i$, or\n\n-   the \u201cideal\u201d generated by (elements of) $J_i$, or\n\n-   the join of ideals $J_i$.\n\nA special sublattice of $L(R)$ is the lattice of finitely generated\nideals of $R$. It is not hard to see that this sublattice comprises\nprecisely the compact elements in $L(R)$.\n\nLooking more closely at the above proof, we also have the following:\n\n$L(R)$ is an algebraic lattice.\n\nAs we have already shown, $L(R)$ is a complete lattice. If $J$ is any\n(left) ideal of $R$, by the previous remark, each $J$ is the sum (or\njoin) of ideals generated by individual elements of $J$. Since these\nideals are principal ideals (generated by a single element), they are\ncompact, and therefore $L(R)$ is algebraic.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   One can easily reconstruct all of the above, if $L(R)$ is the set of\n    *right ideals*, or even *two-sided ideals* of $R$. We may\n    distinguish the three notions: $l.L(R),r.L(R),$ and $L(R)$ as the\n    lattices of left, right, and two-sided ideals of $R$.\n\n-   When $R$ is commutative, $l.L(R)=r.L(R)=L(R)$. Furthermore, it can\n    also be shown that $L(R)$ has the additional structure of a\n    quantale.\n\n-   There is also a related result on lattice theory: the set\n    $\\operatorname{Id}(L)$ of lattice ideals in a upper semilattice $L$\n    with bottom $0$ forms a complete lattice. For a proof of this, see .\n\n-   However, the more general case is not true: the set of order ideals\n    in a poset is a dcpo.",
