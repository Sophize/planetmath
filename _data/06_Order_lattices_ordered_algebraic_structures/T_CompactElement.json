  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set and $\\mathcal{T}$ be a topology on $X$, a well-known\nconcept is that of a compact set: a set $A$ is compact if every open\ncover of $A$ has a finite subcover. Another way of putting this,\nsymbolically, is that if $$A\\subseteq \\bigcup \\mathcal{S},$$ where\n$\\mathcal{S}\\subset \\mathcal{T}$, then there is a finite subset\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of $\\mathcal{S}$, such that\n$$A\\subseteq \\bigcup \\mathcal{F}.$$\n\nA more general concept, derived from above, is that of a *compact\nelement* in a lattice. Let $L$ be a lattice and $a\\in L$. Then $a$ is\nsaid to be *compact* if\n\n> *whenever a subset $S$ of $L$ such that $\\bigvee S$ exists and\n> $a\\le \\bigvee S$, then there is a finite subset $F\\subset S$ such that\n> $a\\le \\bigvee F$.*\n\nIf we let $\\mathcal{D}$ to be the collection of closed subsets of $X$,\nand partial order $\\mathcal{D}$ by inclusion, then $\\mathcal{D}$ becomes\na lattice with meet and join defined by set theoretic intersection and\nunion. It is easy to see that an element $A\\in\\mathcal{D}$ is a compact\nelement iff $D$ is a compact closed subset in $X$.\n\nHere are some other common examples:\n\n1.  Let $C$ be a set and $2^C$ the subset lattice (power set) of $C$.\n    The compact elements of $2^C$ are the finite subsets of $C$.\n\n2.  Let $V$ be a vector space and $L(V)$ be the subspace lattice of $V$.\n    Then the compact elements of $L(V)$ are exactly the finite\n    dimensional subspaces of $V$.\n\n3.  Let $G$ be a group and $L(G)$ the subgroup lattice of $G$. Then the\n    compact elements are the finitely generated subgroups of $G$.\n\n4.  Note in all of the above examples, atoms are compact. However, this\n    is not true in general. Let\u2019s construct one such example. Adjoin the\n    symbol $\\infty$ to the lattice $\\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers (with\n    linear order), so that $n<\\infty$ for all $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. So\n    $\\infty$ is the top element of $\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\lbrace \\infty\\rbrace$\n    (and $1$ is the bottom element!). Next, adjoin a symbol $a$ to\n    $\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\lbrace \\infty\\rbrace$, and define the meet and join\n    properties with $a$ by\n\n    -   $a\\vee n=\\infty$, $a\\wedge n=1$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and\n\n    -   $a\\vee\\infty =\\infty$, $a\\wedge\\infty = a$.\n\n    The resulting set $L=\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\lbrace \\infty,a\\rbrace$ is a\n    lattice where $a$ is a non-compact atom.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   As we have seen from the examples above, compactness is closely\n    associated with the concept of finiteness, a compact element is\n    sometimes called a *finite element*.\n\n-   Any finite join of compact elements is compact.\n\n-   An element $a$ in a lattice $L$ is compact iff for any subset $D$ of\n    $L$ such that $\\bigvee D$ exists and $a\\le \\bigvee D$, then there is\n    an element $d\\in D$ such that $a\\le d$.\n\n-   As the last example indicates, not all atoms are compact. However,\n    in an algebraic lattice, atoms are compact. The first three examples\n    are all instances of algebraic lattices.\n\n-   A compact element may be defined in an arbitrary poset $P$: $a\\in P$\n    is compact iff $a$ is way below itself: $a\\ll a$.\n\n[8]{} G.
