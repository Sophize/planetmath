  "definition": "### Orthogonality Relations {#orthogonality-relations .unnumbered}\n\nLet $L$ be an orthocomplemented lattice and $a,b\\in L$. $a$ is said to\nbe *orthogonal* to $b$ if $a\\le b^{\\perp}$, denoted by $a\\perp b$. If\n$a\\le b^{\\perp}$, then $b=b^{\\perp\\perp}\\le a^{\\perp}$, so $\\perp$ is a\nsymmetric relation on $L$. It is easy to see that, for any $a,b\\in L$,\n$a\\perp b$ implies $a\\wedge b=0$, and $a\\perp a^{\\perp}$.\n\nFor any $a\\in L$, define\n$M(a):=\\lbrace c\\in L\\mid c\\perp a\\mbox{ and }1=c \\vee a\\rbrace$. An\nelement of $M(a)$ is called an *orthogonal complement* of $a$. We have\n$a^{\\perp}\\in M(a)$, and any orthogonal complement of $a$ is a\ncomplement of $a$.\n\nIf we replace the $1$ in $M(a)$ by an arbitrary element $b\\ge a$, then\nwe have the set\n$$M(a,b):=\\lbrace c\\in L\\mid c\\perp a\\mbox{ and }b=c \\vee a\\rbrace.$$ An\nelement of $M(a,b)$ is called an *orthogonal complement* of $a$\n*relative to* $b$. Clearly, $M(a)=M(a,1)$. Also, for $a,c\\le b$,\n$c\\in M(a,b)$ iff $a\\in M(c,b)$. As a result, we can define a symmetric\nbinary operator $\\oplus$ on $[0,b]$, given by $b=a\\oplus c$ iff\n$c\\in M(a,b)$. Note that $b=b\\oplus 0$.\n\nBefore the main definition, we define one more operation:\n$b-a:=b\\wedge a^{\\perp}$. Some properties: (1) $a-a=0$, $a-0=a$,\n$0-a=0$, $a-1=0$, and $1-a=a^{\\perp}$; (2) $b-a=a^{\\perp}-b^{\\perp}$;\nand (3) if $a\\le b$, then $a\\perp (b-a)$ and $a\\oplus (b-a)\\le b$.\n\n### Definition {#definition .unnumbered}\n\nA lattice $L$ is called an *orthomodular lattice* if\n\n1.  $L$ is orthocomplemented, and\n\n2.  (*orthomodular law*) if $x\\le y$, then $y=x\\oplus (y-x)$.\n\nThe orthomodular law can be restated as follows: if $x\\le y$, then\n$y=x\\vee (y\\wedge x^{\\perp})$. Equivalently, $x\\le y$ implies\n$y=(y\\wedge x)\\vee (y\\wedge x^{\\perp})$. Note that the equation is\nautomatically true in an arbitrary distributive lattice, even without\nthe assumption that $x\\le y$.\n\nFor example, the lattice $\\mathbb{C}(H)$ of closed subspaces of a\nhilbert space $H$ is orthomodular. $\\mathbb{C}(H)$ is modular iff $H$ is\nfinite dimensional. In addition, if we give the set $\\mathbb{P}(H)$ of\n(bounded) projection operators on $H$ an ordering structure by defining\n$P\\le Q$ iff $P(H)\\le Q(H)$, then $\\mathbb{P}(H)$ is lattice isomorphic\nto $\\mathbb{C}(H)$, and hence orthomodular.\n\nA simple example of an orthocomplemented lattice that is not\northomodular is the benzene:\n\n$$\\xymatrix {\n& 1 \\ar@{-}[ld] \\ar@{-}[rd] & \\\\\nb \\ar@{-}[d] & & a^{\\perp} \\ar@{-}[d] \\\\\na \\ar@{-}[rd] & & b^{\\perp} \\ar@{-}[ld] \\\\\n& 0 & }$$\n\nNote that $a\\le b$, but $a\\vee (b\\wedge a^{\\perp})=a\\vee 0=a\\ne b$.\n\nAn nice example of an orthomodular lattice that is not modular can be\nfound in the reference below.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Orthomodular lattices were first studied by John von Neumann and\n    Garett Birkhoff, when they were trying to develop the by studying\n    the structure of the lattice $\\mathbb{P}(H)$ of projection operators\n    on a Hilbert space $H$. However, the term was coined by Irving\n    Kaplansky, when it was realized that $\\mathbb{P}(H)$, while\n    orthocomplemented, is not modular. Rather, it satisfies a variant of\n    the modular law as indicated above.\n\n-   More generally, an *orthomodular poset* $P$ is an orthocomplemented\n    poset such that\n\n    1.  given any pair of orthogonal elements $x,y\\in P$\n        ($x\\le y^{\\perp}$), their greatest lower bound exists ($x\\vee y$\n        exists). Simply put, $x\\perp y$ implies $x\\vee y\\in P$.\n\n    2.  for any $x,y\\in P$ such that $x\\le y$, the orthomodular law\n        holds (the right hand side of the orthomodular law exists via\n        the first condition).\n\n    From this definition, we see that an orthomodular lattice is just an\n    orthomodular poset that is also a lattice.\n\n[8]{} L.
