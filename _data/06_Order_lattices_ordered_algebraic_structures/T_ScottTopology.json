  "definition": "Let $P$ be a dcpo. A subset $U$ of $P$ is said to be *Scott open* if it\nsatisfies the following two conditions:\n\n1.  $U$ an upper set: ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}U=U$, and\n\n2.  if $D$ is a directed set with $\\bigvee D\\in U$, then there is a\n    $y\\in D$ such that $(\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ ) \\cap D\\subseteq U$.\n\nCondition 2 is equivalent to saying that $U$ has non-empty intersection\nwith $D$ whenever $D$ is directed and its supremum is in $U$.\n\nFor example, for any $x\\in P$, the set $U(x):=P-(\\ {\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\ )$\nis Scott open: if $y\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}U(x)$, then there is $z\\in U(x)$\nwith $z\\le y$. Since $z\\notin {\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$,\n$y\\notin {\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$. So $y\\in U(x)$, or that $U(x)$ is upper. If\n$D$ is directed and $e\\le x$ for all $e\\in D$, then $d:=\\bigvee D\\le x$\nas well. Therefore, $d\\in U(x)$ implies $e\\in U(x)$ for some $e\\in D$.\nHence $U(x)$ is Scott open.\n\nThe collection $\\sigma(P)$ of all Scott open sets of $P$ is a topology,\ncalled the *Scott topology* of $P$, named after its inventor Dana Scott.\nLet us prove that $\\sigma(P)$ is indeed a topology:\n\nWe verify each of the axioms of an open set:\n\n-   Clearly $P$ itself is Scott open, and $\\varnothing$ is vacuously\n    Scott open.\n\n-   Suppose $U$ and $V$ are Scott open. Let $W=U\\cap V$ and\n    $b\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}W$. Then for some $a\\in W$, $a\\le b$. Since\n    $a\\in U\\cap V$, $b\\in\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}U=U$ and\n    $b\\in\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}V=V$. This means $b\\in W$, so $W$ is an upper\n    set. Next, if $D$ is directed with $\\bigvee D\\in W$, then,\n    $\\bigvee D \\in U\\cap V$. So there are $y,z\\in D$ with\n    $(\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ ) \\cap D\\subseteq U$ and\n    $(\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}z\\ ) \\cap D\\subseteq V$. Since $D$ is directed,\n    there is $t\\in D$ such that\n    $t\\in (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ ) \\cap (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}z\\ )$. So\n    $(\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}t\\ )\\cap D\\subseteq (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ ) \\cap (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}z\\ )\\cap D = \\big( (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ )\\cap D \\big)\\cap \\big( (\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}z\\ )\\cap D\\big)\\subseteq U\\cap V=W$.\n    This means that $W$ is Scott open.\n\n-   Suppose $U_i$ are open and $i\\in I$ an index set. Let\n    $U=\\bigcup \\lbrace U_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ and\n    $b\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}U$. So $a\\le b$ for some $a\\in U$. Since\n    $a\\in U_i$ for some $i\\in I$, $b\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}U_i=U_i$ as $U_i$\n    is upper. Hence $b\\in U_i\\subseteq U$, or that $U$ is upper. Next,\n    suppose $D$ is directed with $\\bigvee D\\in U$. Then\n    $\\bigvee D\\in U_i$ for some $i\\in I$. Since $U_i$ is Scott open,\n    there is $y\\in D$ with\n    $(\\ {\\uparrow\\!\\!}y\\ ) \\cap D\\subseteq U_i \\subseteq U$, so $U$ is\n    Scott open.\n\nSince the Scott open sets satisfy the axioms of a topology, $\\sigma(P)$\nis a topology on $P$.\n\n**Examples**. If $P$ is the unit interval: $P=[0,1]$, then $P$ is a\ncomplete chain, hence a dcpo. Any Scott open set has the form $(a,1]$ if\n$0<a\\le 1$, or $[0,1]$. If $P=[0,1]\\times [0,1]$, the unit square, then\n$P$ is a dcpo as it is already a continuous lattice. The Scott open sets\nof $P$ are any upper subset of $P$ that is also an open set in the usual\nsense.\n\n[8]{} G. Gierz, K. H. Hofmann, K. Keimel, J. D. Lawson, M. W. Mislove,\nD. S.
