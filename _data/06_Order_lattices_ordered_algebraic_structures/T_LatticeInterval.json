  "definition": "**Definition**. Let $L$ be a lattice. A subset $I$ of $L$ is called a\n*lattice interval*, or simply an ** if there exist elements $a,b\\in L$\nsuch that $$I=\\lbrace t\\in L\\mid a\\le t\\le b\\rbrace:=[a,b].$$\n\nThe elements $a,b$ are called the endpoints of $I$. Clearly $a,b\\in I$.\nAlso, the endpoints of a lattice interval are unique: if $[a,b]=[c,d]$,\nthen $a=c$ and $b=d$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   It is easy to see that the name is derived from that of an interval\n    on a number line. From this analogy, one can easily define lattice\n    intervals without one or both endpoints. Whereas an interval on a\n    number line is linearly ordered, a lattice interval in general is\n    not. Nevertheless, a lattice interval $I$ of a lattice $L$ is a\n    sublattice of $L$.\n\n-   A bounded lattice is itself a lattice interval: $[0,1]$.\n\n-   A *prime interval* is a lattice interval that contains its endpoints\n    and nothing else. In other words, if $[a,b]$ is prime, then any\n    $c\\in [a,b]$ implies that either $c=a$ or $c=b$. Simply put, $b$\n    covers $a$. If a lattice $L$ contains $0$, then for any $a\\in L$,\n    $[0,a]$ is a prime interval iff $a$ is an atom.\n\n-   Since no operations of meet and join are used, all of the above\n    discussion can be generalized to define an interval in a poset.\n\n-   Given a lattice $L$, let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all\n    lattice intervals without endpoints, we can form a topolgy on $L$\n    with $\\mathcal{B}$ as the subbasis. This does not insure that\n    $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are continuous, so that $L$ with this\n    topological structure may not be a topological lattice.\n\n-   **Locally Finite Lattice**. A lattice that is derived based on the\n    concept of lattice interval is that of a locally finite lattice. A\n    lattice $L$ is locally finite iff every one of its interval is\n    finite. Unless the lattice is finite, a locally finite lattice, if\n    infinite, is either topless or bottomless.",
