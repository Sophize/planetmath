  "definition": "Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space (over some field) with\ndimension $n$. Let $PG(V)$ be its lattice of subspaces, also known as\nthe projective geometry of $V$. It is well-known that we can associate\neach element $a\\in PG(V)$ a unique integer $\\dim(a)$, namely, the\ndimension of the $a$ as a subspace of $V$. $\\dim$ can be seen as a\nfunction from $PG(V)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. One property of $\\dim$ is that\nfor every $i$ between $0$ and $n$, there is an $a\\in PG(V)$ such that\n$\\dim(a)=i$. If we normalize $\\dim$ by dividing its values by $n$, then\nwe get a function $d: PG(V)\\to [0,1]$. As $n$ (the dimension of $V$)\nincreases, the range of $d$ begins to \u201cfill up\u201d $[0,1]$. Of course, we\nknow this is impossible as long as $V$ is finite dimensional.\n\nis there a \u201cgeometry\u201d on which a \u201cdimension function\u201d is defined so that\nit is onto the closed unit interval $[0,1]$?\n\nThe answer is yes, and the geometry is the so-called \u201ccontinuous\ngeometry\u201d. However, like projective geometries, it is really just a\nlattice (with some special conditions). A continuous geometry $L$ is a\ngeneralization of a projective geometry so that a \u201ccontinuous\u201d dimension\nfunction $d$ can be defined on $L$ such that for every real number\n$r\\in [0,1]$ there is an $a\\in L$ such that $d(a)=r$. Furthermore, $d$\ntakes infinite independent joins to infinite sums:\n$$d(\\bigvee_{i=1}^{\\infty} a_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} d(a_i)\\mbox{ whenever }a_{j+1}\\wedge (\\bigvee_{i=1}^{j} a_i)=0\\mbox{ for }j\\ge 1.$$\n\n**Definition**. A *continuous geometry* is a lattice $L$ that is\ncomplemented, modular, meet continuous, and join continuous.\n\nFrom a continuous geometry $L$, it can be shown that the relation\n$\\thicksim$ on elements of $L$ is a transitive relation (Von Neumann).\nSince $\\thicksim$ is also reflexive and symmetric, it is an equivalence\nrelation. In a projective geometry, perspective elements are exactly\nsubspaces having the same dimension. From this equivalence relation, one\ncan proceed to define a \u201cdimension\u201d function from $L$ into $[0,1]$.\n\nContinuous geometry was introduced by Von Neumann in the 1930\u2019s when he\nwas working on the theory of operator algebras in Hilbert spaces. Write\n$PG(n-1)$ the projective geometry of dimension $n-1$ over $D$ (lattice\nof left (right) subspaces of left (right) $n$-dimensional vector space\nover $D$). Von Neumann found that $PG(n-1)$ can be embedded into\n$PG(2n-1)$ in such a way that not only the lattice operations are\npreserved, but the values of the \u201cnormalized dimension function\u201d $d$\ndescribed above are also preserved. In other words, if\n$\\phi:PG(n-1)\\to PG(2n-1)$ is the embedding, and $d_{n}$ is the\ndimension function on $PG(n-1)$ and $d_{2n}$ is the dimension function\non $PG(2n-1)$, then $d_{n}(a)=d_{2n}(\\phi(a))$. As a result, we get a\nchain of embeddings\n$$PG(1)\\hookrightarrow PG(3)\\hookrightarrow  \\cdots \\hookrightarrow  PG(2^n-1) \\hookrightarrow  \\cdots.$$\nTaking the union of these lattices, we get a lattice $PG(\\infty)$, which\nis complemented and modular, which has a \u201cnormalized dimension function\u201d\n$d$ into $[0,1]$ whose values take the form $p/2^m$ ($p,m$ positive\nintegers). This $d$ is also a valuation on $PG(\\infty)$, turning it into\na metric lattice, which in turn can be completed to a lattice $CG(D)$.\nThis $CG(D)$ is the first example of a continuous geometry having a\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d dimension function.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Any continuous geometry is a complete lattice and a topological\n    lattice if order convergence is used to define a topology on it.\n\n-   An *irreducible continuous geometry* is a continuous geometry whose\n    center is trivial (consisting of just $0$ and $1$). It turns out\n    that an irreducible continuous geometry is just $CG(D)$ for some\n    division ring $D$.\n\n-   (Kaplansky) Any orthocomplemented complete modular lattice is a\n    continuous geometry.\n\n[8]{} J. von Neumann, [*Continuous Geometry*]{}, Princeton, (1960).
