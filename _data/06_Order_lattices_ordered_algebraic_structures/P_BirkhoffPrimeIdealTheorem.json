  "statement": "**Birkhoff Prime Ideal Theorem**. Let $L$ be a distributive lattice and\n$I$ a proper lattice ideal of $L$. Pick any element $a\\notin I$. Then\nthere is a prime ideal $P$ in $L$ such that $I\\subseteq P$ and\n$a\\notin P$.\n\nIf $I$ is prime, then we are done. Let\n$S:=\\lbrace J\\mid J\\mbox{ is an ideal in }L\\mbox{, and }a\\notin J\\rbrace$.\nThen $I\\in S$. Order $S$ by inclusion. This turns $S$ into a poset. Let\n$C$ be a chain in $S$. Let $K=\\bigcup C$. If $x,y\\in K$, then $x\\in J_1$\nand $y\\in J_2$ for some ideals $J_1,J_2\\in C$. Since $C$ is a chain, we\nmay assume that $J_1\\subseteq J_2$, so that $x\\in J_2$ as well. This\nmeans $x\\vee y\\in J_2\\subseteq K$. Next, assume $x\\in K$ and $y\\le x$.\nThen $x\\in J$ for some ideal $J\\in C$, so that $y\\in J\\subseteq K$ also.\nThis shows that $K$ is an ideal. If $a\\in K$, then $a\\in J$ for some\n$J\\in C\\subseteq S$, contradicting the definition of $S$. So $a\\notin K$\nand $K\\in S$ also. This shows that every chain in $S$ has an upper\nbound. We can now appeal to Zorn\u2019s lemma, and conclude that $S$ has a\nmaximal element, say $P$.\n\nWe now want to show that $P$ is the candidate that we are seeking: $P$\nis a prime ideal in $L$ and $a\\notin P$. Since $P\\in S$, $P$ is an ideal\nsuch that $a\\notin P$. So the only thing left to prove is that $P$ is\nprime. This amounts to showing that if $x\\wedge y\\in P$, then $x\\in P$\nor $y\\in P$. Suppose not: $x,y\\notin P$. Let $Q_1$ be the ideal\ngenerated by elements of $P$ and $x$, and $Q_2$ the ideal generated by\n$P$ and $y$. Since $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ properly contain $P$, $a\\in Q_1$ and\n$a\\in Q_2$. Write $a\\le p_1\\vee x$ and $a\\le p_2\\vee y$, where\n$p_1,p_2\\in P$. Then $a\\vee p_2\\le (p_1\\vee p_2)\\vee x$ and\n$a\\vee p_1\\le (p_1\\vee p_2)\\vee y$. Take the meet of these two\nexpressions, and we obtain\n$(a\\vee p_2) \\wedge (a\\vee p_1)\\le ((p_1\\vee p_2)\\vee x)\\wedge((p_1\\vee p_2)\\vee y)$.\nSince $L$ is distributive, on the left hand side, we get\n$a\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)$. On the right hand side, we have\n$(p_1\\vee p_2)\\vee (x\\wedge y)\\in P$. As the left hand side is less than\nor equal to the right hand side, we get that\n$a\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)\\in P$. Since $a\\le a\\vee (p_1\\wedge p_2)\\in P$,\n$a\\in P$, a contradiction. Therefore, $P$ is prime and the proof is\ncomplete.\n\nIn the proof, we use the fact that, an element $a\\in L$ belongs to the\nideal generated by ideals $I_k$ iff $a$ is less than or equal to a\nfinite join of elements, each of which belongs to some $I_k$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n1.  The theorem can be generalized: if we use a subset\n    $S\\cap I=\\varnothing$ instead of an element $a\\notin I$, there is a\n    prime ideal $P$ containing $I$ but excluding $S$.\n\n2.  Birkhoff\u2019s prime ideal theorem has been shown to be equivalent to\n    the axiom of choice, under ZF.",
