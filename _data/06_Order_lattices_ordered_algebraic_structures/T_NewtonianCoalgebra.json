  "definition": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring. A *Newtonian coalgebra* over $R$ is an\n$R$-module $C$ which is simultaneously a coalgebra with comultiplication\n$\\Delta\\colon C\\to C\\otimes C$ and an algebra with multiplication\n$\\cdot\\colon C\\otimes C\\to C$ such that $\\Delta$ is a derivation over\n$\\cdot$, that is, such that the identity\n$$\\Delta(u\\cdot v) = \\Delta(u)\\cdot v + u\\cdot\\Delta(v)$$ holds for any\n$u$ and $v$ in $C$. Newtonian coalgebras were introduced by Joni and\nRota in\u00a0[@JoRo], where they were called *infinitesimal coalgebras*. They\nreserved the term \u201cNewtonian coalgebra\u201d for the special case of the\ncoalgebra of divided differences. This example was studied in more\ndetail by Hirschhorn and Raphael\u00a0[@HiRa]. Joni and Rota also showed that\nNewtonian coalgebras provide a language which can explain iterated\ndifferentiation of trigonometric functions as well as Fa\u00e0 di Bruno\u2019s\nformula. See also the paper of Nichols and Sweedler\u00a0[@NiSw] for more on\ntrigonometric coalgebras.\n\nA Newtonian coalgebra cannot have both a unit and a counit, so no\nNewtonian coalgebra is a Hopf algebra. However, Aguiar\u00a0[@Ag] developed a\nnotion of antipode that makes sense for Newtonian coalgebras, leading to\nwhat he calls an infinitesimal Hopf algebra. Ehrenborg and\nReaddy\u00a0[@EhRe_coproducts] used Newtonian coalgebras to give an algebraic\nstructure to the , a poset invariant generalizing the $f$-vector of\npolytopes.\n\nOne example of a Newtonian coalgebra is the free associative algebra\n$R\\langle\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$ of polynomials on the\nnoncommuting variables $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ with coefficients\nin $R$. The product is the ordinary noncommutative polynomial product,\nand the comultiplication is defined by setting\n$$\\Delta(u_1\\cdots u_n) = \\sum_{j\\in[n]} u_1\\cdots u_{i-1}\\otimes u_{i+1}\\cdots u_n$$\nfor each monomial and extending by linearity.\n\n[99]{} M.\u00a0Aguiar, Infinitesimal Hopf algebras.
