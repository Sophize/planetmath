  "definition": "Let $P_1,P_2$ be two . A function $f:P_1\\to P_2$ is said to be *Scott\ncontinuous* if for any directed set $D\\subseteq P_1$,\n$f(\\bigvee D)=\\bigvee f(D)$.\n\nFirst, observe that $f$ is monotone. If $a\\le b$, then\n$f(b)=f(\\bigvee \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace)=\\bigvee \\lbrace f(a),f(b)\\rbrace$,\nso that $f(a)\\le f(b)$. As a result, if $D$ is directed, so is $f(D)$.\n\n$f:P_1\\to P_2$ is Scott continuous iff it is continuous when $P_1$ and\n$P_2$ are equipped with the Scott topologies.\n\nBefore proving this, let\u2019s make one additional observation:\n\nIf $f$ is continuous (under Scott topologies), then $f$ is monotone.\n\nSuppose $a\\le b\\in P_1$. We wish to show that $f(a)\\le f(b)$, or\n$f(a)\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b)$. Assume the contrary. Consider\n$U=P_2-{\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b)$. Then $f(a)\\in U$ and $U$ is Scott open,\nhence $a\\in f^{-1}(U)$ is Scott open also. Since $a\\le b$ and\n$f^{-1}(U)$ is upper, $b\\in f^{-1}(U)$, which implies\n$f(b)\\in U=P_2-{\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b)$, a contradiction. Therefore,\n$f(a)\\le f(b)$.\n\nNow the proof of the proposition.\n\nSuppose first that $f$ is Scott continuous. Take an open set $U\\in P_2$.\nWe want to show that $V:=f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $P_1$. In other words,\n$V$ is upper and that $V$ has non-empty intersection with any directed\nset $D\\in P_1$ whenever its supremum $\\bigvee D$ lies in $V$. If\n$a\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}V$, then some $b\\in V$ with $b\\le a$, which implies\n$f(b)\\le f(a)$. Since $f(b)\\in U$, $f(a)\\in {\\uparrow\\!\\!}U=U$, so\n$a\\in f^{-1}(U)=V$, $V$ is upper. Now, suppose $\\bigvee D \\in V$. So\n$\\bigvee f(D)=f(\\bigvee D)\\in U$. Since $f(D)$ is directed, there is\n$y\\in f(D)\\cap U$, which means there is $x\\in P_1$ such that $f(x)=y$\nand $x \\in D\\cap V$. This shows that $V$ is Scott open.\n\nConversely, suppose $f$ is continuous (inverse of a Scott open set is\nScott open). Let $D$ be a directed subset of $P_1$ and let\n$d=\\bigvee D$. We want to show that $f(d)=\\bigvee f(D)$. First, for any\n$e\\in D$, we have that $e\\le d$ so that $f(e)\\le f(d)$ since $f$ is\nmonotone. This shows $\\bigvee f(D)\\le f(d)$. Now suppose $r$ is any\nupper bound of $f(D)$. We want to show that $f(d)\\le r$, or\n$f(d)\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}r$. Assume not. Then $f(d)$ lies in\n$U:=P_2-{\\downarrow\\!\\!}r$, a Scott open set. So\n$\\bigvee D=d\\in f^{-1}(U)$, also Scott open, which implies some $e\\in D$\nwith $e\\in f^{-1}(U)$, or $f(e)\\in U$. This means $f(e) \\not\\le r$, a\ncontradiction. Thus $f(d)\\le r$, and the proof is complete.\n\n**Remark**. This notion of continuity is attributed to Dana Scott when\nhe was trying to come up with a model for the formal system of untyped\nlambda calculus.\n\n[8]{} G. Gierz, K. H. Hofmann, K. Keimel, J. D.
