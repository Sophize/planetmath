  "statement": "Let $T:X\\rightarrow X$ be a continuous tranformation in a compact metric\nspace $X$. Then, there exists some point $x \\in X$ that is recurrent to\n$T$, that is, there exists a sequence $(n_k)_k$ such that\n$T^{n_k}(x)\\rightarrow x$ when $k\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nSeveral proofs of this theorem are available. It may be obtained from\ntopological arguments together with Zorn\u2019s lemma. It is also a\nconsequence of Krylov-Bogolyubov theorem, or existence of invariant\nprobability measures theorem, which asserts that every continuous\ntransformation in a compact metric space admits an invariant probability\nmeasure, and an application of Poincar\u00e9 Recurrence theorem to that\ninvariant probability measure yields Birkhoff Recurrence theorem.\n\nThere is also a generalization of Birkhoff recurrence theorem for\nmultiple commuting transformations, known as Birkhoff Multiple\nRecurrence theorem.",
