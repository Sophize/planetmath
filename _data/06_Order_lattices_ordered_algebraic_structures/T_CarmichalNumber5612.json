  "definition": "561 is the smallest Carmichael number in the ring of integers. However\nit is only a pseudoprime in the ring of Gaussian integers. We can use\npari to find the bases to which 561 is a pseudoprime. I found it is\npseudoprime to bases 12 + i, 22 +i, 33 + i and 44 + i. Needless to say\nit is a pseudoprime to other bases too. More on this later.",
