  "definition": "A *poset*, or *partially ordered set*, consists of a set $P$ and a\nbinary relation $\\le$ on $P$ which satisfies the following properties:\n\n-   $\\le$ is , so $a\\le a$ always holds;\n\n-   $\\le$ is *antisymmetric*, so if $a\\le b$ and $b\\le a$ hold, then\n    $a=b$; and\n\n-   $\\le$ is , so if $a\\le b$ and $b\\le c$ hold, then $a\\le c$ also\n    holds.\n\nThe relation $\\le$ is called a *partial order* on $P$. In practice,\n$(P,\\le)$ is usually conflated with $P$; if a distinction is needed, $P$\nis called the *ground set* or *underlying set* of $(P,\\le)$. The binary\nrelation $<$ defined by removing the diagonal from $\\le$ (i.e. $a<b$ iff\n$a\\leq b$ and $a\\neq b$) satisfies the following properties:\n\n-   $<$ is *irreflexive*, so if $a<b$ holds, then $b<a$ does not hold;\n    and\n\n-   $<$ is *transitive*.\n\nSince $\\le$ is reflexive, it can be uniquely recovered from $<$ by\nadding the diagonal. For this reason, an irreflexive and transitive\nbinary relation $<$ (called a *strict partial order*) also defines a\nposet, by means of the associated relation $\\le$ described above (which\nis called *weak partial order*).\n\nSince every partial order is reflexive and transitive, every poset is a\npreorder. The notion of partial order is stricter than that of preorder,\nLet $Q$ be the structure with ground set $Q=\\{a,b\\}$ and binary relation\n$\\preceq\\, = \\{(a,a),(a,b),(b,a),(b,b)\\}$. A diagram of this structure,\nomitting loops, is displayed below. $$\\xymatrix{\nb\\ar@/^/[d] \\\\\na\\ar@/^/[u]\n}$$ Observe that the binary relation on $Q$ is reflexive and transitive,\nso $Q$ is a preorder. On the other hand, $a\\preceq b$ and $b\\preceq\na$, while $a\\ne b$. So the binary relation on $Q$ is not antisymmetric,\nimplying that $Q$ is not a poset.\n\nSince every total order is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive,\nevery total order is a poset. The notion of partial order is weaker than\nthat of total order. A total order must obey the trichotomy law, which\nstates that for any $a$ and $b$ in the order, either $a\\le b$ or\n$b\\le a$. Let $P$ be the structure with ground set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ and\nbinary relation $\\le\\, = \\{(a,a),(a,b),(a,c),(b,b),(c,c)\\}$. A diagram\nof this structure, omitting loops, is displayed below. $$\\xymatrix{\nb &                 & c \\\\\n  & a\\ar[ul]\\ar[ur] &\n}$$ Observe that the binary relation on $P$ is reflexive, antisymmetric,\nand transitive, so $P$ is a poset. On the other hand, neither $b\\le\nc$ nor $c\\le b$ holds in $P$. Thus $P$ fails to satisfy the trichotomy\nlaw and is not a total order.\n\nThe failure of the trichotomy law for posets motivates the following\nterminology. Let $P$ be a poset. If $a\\le b$ or $b\\le a$ holds in $P$,\nwe say that $a$ and $b$ are *comparable*; otherwise, we say they are\n*incomparable*. We use the notation $a\\shortparallel b$ to indicate that\n$a$ and $b$ are incomparable.\n\nIf $(P,\\le_P)$ and $(Q,\\le_Q)$ are posets, then a function\n$\\varphi\\colon P\\to Q$ is said to be *order-preserving*, or *monotone*,\nprovided that it preserves inequalities. That is, $\\varphi$ is\norder-preserving if whenever $a\\le_P b$ holds, it follows that\n$\\varphi(a)\\le_Q\\varphi(b)$ also holds. The identity function on the\nground set of a poset is order-preserving. If $(P,\\le_P)$, $(Q,\\le_Q)$,\nand $(R,\\le_R)$ are posets and $\\varphi\\colon P\\to Q$ and\n$\\psi\\colon Q\\to R$ are order-preserving functions, then the composition\n$\\psi\\circ\\varphi\\colon P\\to R$ is also order-preserving.\n\nPosets together with order-preserving functions form a category, which\nwe denoted by $\\mathbf{Poset}$. Thus an order-preserving function\nbetween the ground sets of two posets is sometimes also called a\n*morphism of posets*. The category of posets has . Moreover, every poset\ncan itself be viewed as a category, and it turns out that a morphism of\nposets is the same as a functor between the two posets.\n\nExamples of posets {#examples-of-posets .unnumbered}\n==================\n\nThe two extreme posets are the chain, in which any two elements are\ncomparable, and the antichain, in which no two elements are comparable.\nA poset with a singleton underlying set is necessarily both a chain and\nan antichain, but a poset with a larger underlying set cannot be both.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers. Inductively define a\nbinary relation $\\le$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ by the following rules:\n\n-   for any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the relation $0\\le n$ holds; and\n\n-   whenever $m\\le n$, the relation $m+1\\le n+1$ also holds.\n\nThen $(\\mathbb{N},\\le)$ is a chain, hence a poset. This structure can be\nnaturally embedded in the larger chains of the integers, the rational\nnumbers, and the real numbers.\n\nThe next example shows that nontrivial antichains exist.\n\nLet $P$ be a set with cardinality greater than $1$. Let $\\le$ be the\ndiagonal of $P$. Thus $\\le$ represents equality, which is trivially a\npartial order relation (which is also the intersection of all partial\norderings on $P$). By construction, $a\\le b$ in $P$ if and only $a=b$.\nThus no two elements of $P$ are comparable.\n\nSo far the only posets we have seen are chains and antichains. Most\nposets are neither. The following construction gives many such examples.\n\nIf $X$ is any set, the powerset $P=P(X)$ of $X$ is partially ordered by\ninclusion, that is, by the relation $A\\le B$ if and only if\n$A\\subseteq B$.\n\nThere are important structure theorems for posets concerning chains and\nantichains. One of the foundational results is Dilworth\u2019s theorem. This\ntheorem was massively generalized by Greene and Kleitman.\n\nA final example shows that one can manufacture a poset from an existing\none.\n\nLet $P$ be a poset ordered by $\\le$. The *dual poset* of $P$ is defined\nas follows: it has the same underlying set as $P$, whose order is\ndefined by $a\\le'b$ iff $b\\le a$. It is easy to see that $\\le'$ is a\npartial order. The dual of $P$ is usually denoted by $P^{\\partial}$.\n\nGraph-theoretical view of posets {#graph-theoretical-view-of-posets .unnumbered}\n================================\n\nLet $P$ be a poset with strict partial order $<$. Then $P$ can be viewed\nas a directed graph with vertex set the ground set of $P$ and edge set\n$<$. For example, the following diagram displays the Boolean algebra\n$B_2$ as a directed graph. $$\\xymatrix{\n             & \\{0,1\\}                        &              \\\\\n\\{0\\}\\ar[ur] &                                & \\{1\\}\\ar[ul] \\\\\n             & \\emptyset\\ar[ul]\\ar[uu]\\ar[ur] &\n}$$ If $P$ is a sufficiently complicated poset, then drawing all of the\nedges of $P$ can obscure rather than reveal the structure of $P$. For\nthis reason it is convenient to restrict attention to a subrelation of\n$<$ from which $<$ can be uniquely recovered.\n\nWe describe a method of constructing a canonical subgraph of $P$ from\nwhich the partial order can be recovered as long as every interval of\n$P$ has finite height. If $a$ and $b$ are elements of $P$, then we say\nthat $b$ *covers* $a$ if $a<b$ and there are no elements of $P$ strictly\nlarger than $a$ but strictly smaller than $b$, that is, if\n$[a,b]=\\{a,b\\}$. Two elements are said to be *consecutive* if one covers\nanother. Define a binary relation $<:$ on $P$ by\n$$a <: b \\text{\\ if and only if $b$ covers $a$.}$$ By construction, the\nbinary relation $<:$ is a subset of $<$. Since $<$ is transitive, the of\n$<:$ is also contained in $<$.\n\nSuppose every interval of $P$ has finite height. Then $<$ is the\ntransitive closure of $<:$.\n\nWe prove this by induction on height. By definition of $<:$, if $a<b$\nand the height of $[a,b]$ is 1, then $a<:b$.\n\nAssume for induction that whenever $a<b$ and the height of $[a,b]$ is at\nmost $n$, then $(a,b)$ is in the transitive closure of $<:$. Suppose\nthat $a<b$ and that the height of $[a,b]$ is $n+1$. Since every chain in\n$[a,b]$ is finite, it contains an element $c$ which is strictly larger\nthan $a$ and with respect to this property. Therefore $[a,c]=\\{a,c\\}$,\nfrom which we conclude that $a<:c$. Since the interval $[c,b]$ is a\nproper subinterval of $[a,b]$, it has height at most $n$, so by the\ninduction assumption we conclude that $(c,b)$ is in the transitive\nclosure of $<:$. Since $(a,c)$ and $(c,b)$ are in the transitive closure\nof $<:$, so is $(a,b)$. Hence whenever $a<b$ and the height of $[a,b]$\nis at most $n+1$, then $(a,b)$ is in the transitive closure of $<:$.\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nIn the same way we associated a graph to $<$ we can associate a graph to\n$<:$. The graph is usually called the Hasse diagram of the poset. Below\nwe display the graph associated to the cover relation $<:$ of $B_2$.\n$$\\xymatrix{\n             & \\{0,1\\}                 &              \\\\\n\\{0\\}\\ar[ur] &                         & \\{1\\}\\ar[ul] \\\\\n             & \\emptyset\\ar[ul]\\ar[ur] &              \n}$$ For simplicity, the Hasse diagram of a poset is usually drawn as an\nundirected graph. Elements which are higher in the partial order\nrelation are drawn physically higher. Since a strict partial order is\nacyclic, this can be done uniquely and the partial order can be\nrecovered from the drawing.\n\n[1]{} Gr\u00e4tzer, G., *General lattice theory*, 2nd ed., Birkh\u00e4user, 1998.\n\nStanley, R., *Enumerative Combinatorics*, vol. 1, 2nd ed., Cambridge\nUniversity Press, Cambridge, 1996.",
