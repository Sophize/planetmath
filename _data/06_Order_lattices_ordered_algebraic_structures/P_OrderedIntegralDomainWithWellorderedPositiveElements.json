  "statement": "If $(R,\\,\\leq)$ is an integral domain and if the set\n$R_+ = \\{r\\in R: \\,\\,0 < r\\}$ of its is well-ordered, then $R$ and $R_+$\ncan be expressed as sets of multiples of the unity as follows:\n\n-   $R   = \\{m\\cdot 1: \\,\\,m\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$,\n\n-   $R_+ = \\{n\\cdot 1: \\,\\,n\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+\\}$.\n\nThe theorem may be interpreted so that such an integral domain is\nisomorphic with the ordered ring $\\mathbb{Z}$ of rational integers.",
