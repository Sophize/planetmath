  "statement": "For an ordered group, having one is to an Archimedean property. In this\nentry, we use multiplicative notation for groups.\n\n**Lemma** An ordered group has rank one if and only if, for every two\nelements $x$ and $y$ such that $x < y < 1$, there exists an integer\n$n > 1$ such that $y^n < x$.\n\n[*Proof*]{} Suppose that the Archimedean property is satisfied and that\n$F$ is an isolated subgroup of $G$. We shall show that if $F$ contains\nany element other than the identity, then $F = G$. First note that there\nmust exist an $x \\in F$ such that $x < 1$. By assumption, there must\nexist an element $x' \\in F$ such that $x' \\neq 1$. By conclusion 1 of\nthe basic theorem on ordered groups, either $x' < 1$, or $x' > 1$ (since\nwe assumed that the case $x' = 1$ is excluded). If $x' < 1$, set\n$x = x'$. If not, by conclusion 5, if $x' > 1$, then we will have\n$x'^{-1} < 0$ and therefore will set $x = x'^{-1}$ when $x > 1$.\n\nLet $y$ be any element of $G$. There are five possibilities:\n\n1.  $y = 1$\n\n2.  $x = y$\n\n3.  $x < y < 1$\n\n4.  $y < x < 1$\n\n5.  $1 < y$\n\nWe shall show that in each of these cases, $y \\in F$.\n\n1.  Trivial \u2014 1 is an element of every group.\n\n2.  Trivial \u2014 $x$ is assumed to belong to $F$\n\n3.  Since $F$ is an isolated subgroup, $y \\in G$.\n\n4.  By the Archimedean property,there exists an integer $n$ such that\n    $x^n < y < 1$. Since $x^n \\in F$ and $F$ is , it follows that\n    $y \\in F$.\n\n5.  $1 < y$ By conclusion 5 of the basic theorem on ordered groups,\n    $y^{-1} < 1$. By conclusion 1 of the same theorem, either\n    $y^{-1} < x$ or $y^{-1} = 1$ or $x < y$. In each of these three\n    cases, it follows that $y^{-1} \\in F$ from what we have already\n    shown. Since $F$ is a group, $y^{-1} \\in F$ implies $y \\in F$.\n\nThis shows that the only isolated subgroups of $G$ are the two trivial\nsubgroups (i.e. the group $\\{1\\}$ and $G$ itself), and hence $G$ has\nrank one.\n\nNext, suppose that $G$ does not enjoy the Archimedean property. Then\nthere must exist $x \\in G$ and $y \\in G$ such that $x < y^n < 1$ for all\nintegers $n > 0$. Define the sets $F_n$ as\n$$F_n = \\{ z \\in G \\mid y^n \\leqq z \\leqq y^{-n} \\}$$ and define\n$F = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty F_n$.\n\nWe shall show that $F$ is a subgroup of $G$. First, note that, by a\ncorollary of the basic theorem on ordered groups, $y^n < 1 < y$, so\n$1 \\in F_n$ for all $n$, hence $1 \\in F$. Second, suppose that\n$z \\in F_n$. Then $y^n \\leqq z \\leqq y^{-n}$. By conclusion 5 of the\nbasic theorem, $y^n \\leqq z$ implies $z^{-1} \\leqq y^{-n}$ and\n$z \\leqq y^{-n}$ implies $y^n \\leqq z^{-1}$. Thus,\n$y^n \\leqq z^{-1} \\leqq y^{-n}$, so $z^{-1} \\in F_n$. Hence, if\n$z \\in F$, then $z^{-1} \\in F$. Third, suppose that $z \\in F$ and\n$w \\in F$. Then there must exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that\n$z \\in F_n$ and $w \\in F_m$, so $$y^n \\leqq z \\leqq y^{-n}$$ and\n$$y^m \\leqq w \\leqq y^{-m}.$$ Using conclusion 4 of the main theorem\nrepeatedly, we conclude that $$y^{m+n} \\leqq z w \\leqq y^{-m-n}$$ so\n$z w \\in F_{m+n}$. Hence, if $z \\in F$ and $w \\in F$, then $zw \\in F$.\nthis the proof that $F$ is a subgroup of $G$.\n\nNot only is $F$ a subgroup of $G$, it is an isolated subgroup. Suppose\nthat $f \\in F$ and $g \\in G$ and $f \\leqq g \\leqq 1$. Since $f \\in F$,\nthere must exist an $n$ such that $f \\in F_n$, hence $y^n \\leqq f$. By\nconclusion 2 of the basic theorem on ordered groups, $y^n \\leqq f$ and\n$f \\leqq g$ imply $y^n \\leqq g$. Combining this with the facts that\n$g \\leqq 1$ and $1 \\leqq y^{-n}$, we conclude that\n$y^n \\leqq g \\leqq y^{-n}$, so $g \\in F_n$. Hence $g \\in F$.\n\nNote that $F$ is not trivial since $y \\notin F$. The reason for this is\nthat $x \\notin F_n$ for any $n$ because we assumed that $x < y^n$ for\nall $n$. Hence, the order of the group $G$ must be at least 2 because\n$F$ and $\\{ 1 \\}$ are two examples of isolated subgroups of $F$.",
