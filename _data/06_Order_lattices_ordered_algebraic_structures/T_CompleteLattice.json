Thus $L$ is a bounded lattice,\nwith $1$ as its greatest element and $0$ as its least element. Moreover,\n$1$ is the infimum of the empty set, and $0$ is the supremum of the\nempty set.\n\nGeneralizations {#generalizations .unnumbered}\n===============\n\nA *countably complete lattice* is a poset $P$ such that every countable\nsubset of $P$ has both a supremum and an infimum in $P$.\n\nLet $\\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal. A $\\kappa$-complete lattice is a\nlattice $L$ such that for every subset $A\\subseteq L$ with\n$|A|\\le \\kappa$, both $\\bigvee A$ and $\\bigwedge A$ exist. (Note that an\n$\\aleph_0$-complete lattice is the same as a countably complete\nlattice.)\n\nEvery complete lattice is a for every infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, and in\nparticular is a countably complete lattice. Every countably complete\nlattice is a bounded lattice.",
