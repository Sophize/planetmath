  "definition": "### Cartesian Ordering {#cartesian-ordering .unnumbered}\n\nLet $(P_1,\\le_1)$ and $(P_2,\\le_2)$ be posets. Let $P=P_1\\times P_2$,\nthe Cartesian product of the underlying sets. Next, define a binary\nrelation $\\le$ on $P$, given by\n$$(a,b)\\le (c,d)\\qquad\\mbox{ iff }\\qquad a\\le_1 c\\mbox{ and }b\\le_2 d.$$\nThen $\\le$ is a partial order on $P$. $(P,\\le)$ is called the *product\nof posets* $(P_1,\\le_1)$ and $(P_2,\\le_2)$. The ordering $\\le$ is called\nthe *Cartesian ordering*. As it is customary, we write $P$ to mean\n$(P,\\le)$.\n\nIf $P_1$ and $P_2$ are antichains, their product is also an antichain.\nIf they are both join semilattices, then their product $P$ is a join\nsemilattice as well. The join of $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are given by\n$$(a,b)\\vee (c,d)=(a\\vee_1 c,b\\vee_2 d).$$ Conversely, if the product\n$P$ of two posets $P_1$ and $P_2$ is a join semilattice, then $P_1$ and\n$P_2$ are both join semilattices. If $(a,b)\\vee (c,d)=(e,f)$, then $e$\nis the upper bound of $a$ and $c$. If $g\\le e$ is an upper bound of $a$\nand $c$, then $(g,f)$ is an upper bound of $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, whence\n$(g,f)=(e,f)$, or $g=e$. So $g=a\\vee_1 c$. Similarly, $f=b\\vee_2 d$.\nDually, $P=P_1\\times P_2$ is a meet semilattice (and consequently, a\nlattice) iff both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are. Equivalently, the product of\n(semi)lattices can be defined purely algebraically (using $\\vee$ and\n$\\wedge$ only).\n\nAnother simple fact about the product of posets is the following: the\nproduct is never a chain unless one of the posets is trivial (a\nsingleton). To see this, let $P=P_1\\times P_2$ and $(a,b),(c,d)\\in P$.\nThen $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are comparable, say $(a,b)\\le (c,d)$, which\nimplies $a\\le_1 c$ and $b\\le_2 d$. Also, $(c,b)$ and $(a,d)$ are\ncomparable. But since $b\\le_2 d$, we must have $(c,b)\\le (a,d)$, which\nmeans $c\\le_1 a$, showing $a=c$, or $P_1=\\lbrace a\\rbrace$.\n\n**Remark**. The product of two posets can be readily extended to any\nfinite product, countably infinite product, or even arbitrary product of\nposets. The definition is similar to the one given above and will not be\nrepeated here.\n\nAn example of a product of posets is the , which is defined as the free\nabelian group over $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $n$ generators. But from a poset\nperspective, it can be viewed as a product of $n$ chains, each order\nisomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. As we have just seen earlier, this product\nis a lattice, and hence the name \u201clattice\u201d in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n### Lexicographic Ordering {#lexicographic-ordering .unnumbered}\n\nAgain, let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be posets. Form the Cartesian product of\n$P_1$ and $P_2$ and call it $P$. There is another way to partial order\n$P$, called the *lexicographic order*. Specifically,\n$$(a,b)\\le (c,d)\\quad\\mbox{ iff }\\quad\\begin{cases}\na\\le c\\mbox{, or }\\\\\na=c\\mbox{ and }b\\le d.\n\\end{cases}$$ More generally, if $\\lbrace P_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a\ncollection of posets indexed by a set $I$ that is linearly ordered, then\nthe Cartesian product $P:=\\prod P_i$ also has the lexicographic order:\n\n> $(a_i)\\le (b_i)$ iff there is some $k\\in I$ such that $a_j=b_j$ for\n> all $j< k$ and $a_k\\le b_k$.\n\nWe show that this is indeed a partial order on $P$:\n\nThe three things we need to verify are\n\n-   (Reflexivity). Clearly, $(a_i)\\le (a_i)$, since $a_i\\le a_i$ for any\n    $i\\in I$.\n\n-   (Transitivity). If $(a_i)\\le (b_i)$ and $(b_i)\\le (c_i)$, then for\n    some $k,\\ell\\in I$ we have that\n\n    1.  $a_j=b_j$ for all $j<k$ and $a_k\\le b_k$, and\n\n    2.  $b_j=c_j$ for all $j<\\ell$ and $b_{\\ell}\\le c_{\\ell}$.\n\n    Since $I$ is a total order, $k$ and $\\ell$ are comparable, say\n    $k\\le \\ell$, so that $a_j=b_j=c_j$ for all $k<\\ell$ and\n    $a_k\\le b_k\\le c_k$. Since $P_k$ is partially ordered, $a_k\\le c_k$\n    as well. Therefore $(a_i)\\le (c_i)$.\n\n-   (Antisymmetry). Finally, suppose $(a_i)\\le (b_i)$ and\n    $(b_i)\\le (a_i)$. If $(a_i)\\ne (b_i)$, then $(a_i)\\le (b_i)$ implies\n    that we can find $k\\in I$ such that $a_j=b_j$ for all $j<k$ and\n    $a_k<b_k$. By the same token, $(b_i)\\le (a_i)$ implies the existence\n    of $\\ell\\in I$ with $b_j=a_j$ for all $j<\\ell$ and\n    $b_{\\ell}<a_{\\ell}$. Since $I$ is linearly ordered, we can again\n    assume that $k\\le \\ell$. But then this means that either $k<\\ell$,\n    in which case $b_k=a_k$, a contradiction, or $k=\\ell$, in which case\n    we have that $a_k<b_k=b_{\\ell}<a_{\\ell}=a_k$, another contradiction.\n    Therefore $(a_i)=(b_i)$.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
