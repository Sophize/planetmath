  "definition": "Let $L$ be a lattice. An *ideal* $I$ of $L$ is a non-empty subset of $L$\nsuch that\n\n1.  $I$ is a sublattice of $L$, and\n\n2.  for any $a\\in I$ and $b\\in L$, $a\\wedge b\\in I$.\n\nNote the similarity between this definition and the definition of an in\na ring (except in a ring with 1, an ideal is almost never a subring)\n\nSince the fact that $a\\wedge b\\in I$ for $a,b\\in I$ in the first\ncondition is already implied by the second condition, we can replace the\nfirst condition by a weaker one:\n\n> for any $a,b\\in I$, $a\\vee b\\in I$.\n\nAnother equivalent characterization of an ideal $I$ in a lattice $L$ is\n\n1.  for any $a,b\\in I$, $a\\vee b\\in I$, and\n\n2.  for any $a\\in I$, if $b\\le a$, then $b\\in I$.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick proof. In fact, all we need to show is that the two\nsecond conditions are equivalent for $I$. First assume that for any\n$a\\in I$ and $b\\in L$, $a\\wedge b\\in I$. If $b\\le a$, then\n$b=a\\wedge b\\in I$. Conversely, since $a\\wedge b\\le a\\in I$,\n$a\\wedge b\\in I$ as well.\n\n**Special Ideals**. Let $I$ be an ideal of a lattice $L$. Below are some\ncommon types of ideals found in lattice theory.\n\n-   $I$ is *proper* if $I\\ne L$.\n\n-   If $L$ contains $0$, $I$ is said to be *non-trivial* if $I\\ne 0$.\n\n-   $I$ is a *prime ideal* if it is proper, and for any\n    $a\\wedge b\\in I$, either $a\\in I$ or $b\\in I$.\n\n-   $I$ is a *maximal ideal* of $L$ if $I$ is proper and the only ideal\n    having $I$ as a proper subset is $L$.\n\n-   **ideal generated by a set**. Let $X$ be a subset of a lattice $L$.\n    Let $S$ be the set of all ideals of $L$ containing $X$. Since\n    $S\\ne\\varnothing$ ($L\\in S$), the intersection $M$ of all elements\n    in $S$, is also an ideal of $L$ that contains $X$. $M$ is called the\n    *ideal generated by* $X$, written $(X]$. If $X$ is a singleton\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$, then $M$ is said to be a *principal ideal*\n    generated by $x$, written $(x]$. (Note that this construction can be\n    easily carried over to the construction of a *sublattice generated\n    by* a subset of a lattice).\n\n**Remarks**. Let $L$ be a lattice.\n\n1.  Given any subset $X\\subset L$, let $X'$ be the set consisting of all\n    finite joins of elements of $X$, which is clearly a directed set.\n    Then ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}X'$, the down set of $X'$, is $(X]$. Any\n    element of $(X]$ is less than or equal to a finite join of elements\n    of $X$.\n\n2.  If $L$ is a distributive lattice, every maximal ideal is prime.\n    Suppose $I\\subseteq L$ is maximal and $a\\wedge b\\in I$ with\n    $a\\notin I$. Then the ideal generated by $I$ and $a$ must be $L$, so\n    that $b\\le p\\vee a$ for some $p\\in I$. Then\n    $b=b\\wedge b\\le (p\\vee a)\\wedge b=(p\\wedge b)\\vee (a\\wedge b)\\in I$,\n    which means $b\\in I$. So $I$ is prime.\n\n3.  If $L$ is a complemented lattice, every prime ideal is maximal.\n    Suppose $I\\subseteq L$ is prime and $a\\notin I$. Let $b$ be a\n    complement of $a$, then $b\\in I$, for otherwise,\n    $0=a\\wedge b\\notin I$, a contradiction. Let $J$ be the ideal\n    generated by $I$ and $a$, then $1\\le b\\vee a\\in J$, so $J=L$.\n\n4.  Combining the two results above, in a Boolean algebra, an ideal is\n    prime iff it is maximal.\n\n**Examples**. In the lattice $L$ below,\n\n$$\\xymatrix{\n& 1 \\ar@{-}[ld] \\ar@{-}[rd] \\\\\na \\ar@{-}[rd] & & b \\ar@{-}[ld] \\\\\n& c \\ar@{-}[d] & \\\\\n& d \\ar@{-}[ld] \\ar@{-}[rd] & \\\\\ne \\ar@{-}[rd] & & f \\ar@{-}[ld] \\\\\n& 0\n}$$\n\nBesides $L$ and $\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$, below are all proper ideals of $L$:\n\n-   $M=\\lbrace a, c, d, e, f, 0\\rbrace$,\n\n-   $N=\\lbrace b, c, d, e, f, 0\\rbrace$,\n\n-   $R=\\lbrace c, d, e, f, 0\\rbrace$,\n\n-   $S=\\lbrace d, e, f, 0\\rbrace$,\n\n-   $T=\\lbrace e, 0\\rbrace$, and\n\n-   $U=\\lbrace f, 0\\rbrace$.\n\nOut of these, $M,N,S,T,U$ are prime, and $M,N$ are maximal. The ideal\ngenerated by, say $\\lbrace c,e\\rbrace$, is $R$. Looking more closely, we\nsee that $R$ can actually be generated by $c$, and so is principal. In\nfact, all ideals in $L$ are principal, generated by their maximal\nelements. It is not hard to see, that in a lattice $L$ with acc\n(ascending chain condition), all ideals are principal:\n\n. First, let\u2019s show that an ideal $I$ in a lattice $L$ with acc has at\nleast one maximal element. Suppose $a\\in I$. If $a$ is not maximal in\n$I$, there is a $a_1\\in I$ such that $a\\le a_1$. If $a_1$ is not maximal\nin $I$, repeat the process above so we get a chain\n$a\\le a_1\\le a_2\\le\\ldots$ in $I$. Eventually this chain terminates\n$a_n=a_{n+1}=\\cdots$. Thus $b=a_n$ is maximal in $I$. Next, suppose that\n$I$ has two distinct maximal elements. Then their join is again in $I$,\ncontradicting maximality. So $b$ is unique and all elements $c$ such\nthat $c\\le b$ must be in $I$. Therefore, $I=(b]$.\n\nFinally, an example of a sublattice that is not an ideal is the subset\n$\\lbrace b, c, d, e, 0\\rbrace$.",
