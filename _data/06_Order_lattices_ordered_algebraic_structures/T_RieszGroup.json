  "definition": "Let $G$ be a po-group and $G^+$ the positive cone of $G$. The following\nare equivalent:\n\n1.  $G$, as a poset, sastisfies the Riesz interpolation property;\n\n2.  if $x,y_1,y_2\\in G^+$ and $x\\le y_1y_2$, then $x=z_1z_2$ with\n    $z_i\\le y_i$ for some $z_i\\in G^+$, $i=1,2$.\n\nThe second property above, put it plainly, says that any positive\nelement that is bounded from above by a product of positive elements,\ncan be \u201cdecomposed\u201d as a product of positive elements. This property is\nknown as the *Riesz decomposition property*.\n\n$(1\\Rightarrow 2)$. Given $x\\le y_1y_2$ and $e\\le x,y_1,y_2$. Set\n$r=y_1^{-1}x$. Then we have four inequalities, which can be abbreviated\nas $\\lbrace r,e\\rbrace \\le \\lbrace x,y_2\\rbrace$, where each of the\nelements in the first set is less than or equal to each of the elements\nin the second set. By the Riesz interpolation property, we can insert an\nelement between the sets:\n$\\lbrace r,e\\rbrace \\le z_2 \\le \\lbrace x,y_2\\rbrace$. From this it is\nclear that $e\\le z_2\\le y_1$. Set $z_1=xz_2^{-1}$. Since $z_2\\le x$, we\nhave $e\\le xz_2^{-1}=z_1$. Also, since $y_1^{-1}x=r\\le z_2$,\n$z_2^{-1}\\le x^{-1}y_1$, so that $z_1\\le x(x^{-1}y_1)=y_1$.\n\n$(2\\Rightarrow 1)$. Suppose $\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace \\le \\lbrace c,d\\rbrace$.\nSet $x=a^{-1}c$, $y_1=a^{-1}d$ and $y_2=b^{-1}c$. Then\n$x,y_1,y_2\\in G^+$. Since $e\\le db^{-1}$, we have\n$x=a^{-1}c= a^{-1}ec\\le a^{-1}(db^{-1})c= (a^{-1}d)(b^{-1}c)=y_1y_2$. By\nthe Riesz decomposition property, $a^{-1}c=x=z_1z_2$ for some\n$z_1,z_2\\in G$ with $e\\le z_1\\le y_1=a^{-1}d$ and\n$e\\le z_2\\le y_2=b^{-1}c$. The decomposition equality can be rewritten\nas $c=az_1z_2$, and the last two inequalities can be rewritten as\n$az_1\\le d$ and $bz_2\\le c$. Set $s=az_1$, so we have\n$a\\le az_1=s\\le az_1z_2=c$. Furthermore, since $bz_2\\le c=az_1z_2$, we\nget $b\\le az_1=s$. Finally from $z_1\\le a^{-1}d$, we have $s=az_1\\le d$.\nGather all the inequalities, we have finally\n$\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace\\le s\\le\\lbrace c,d\\rbrace$.\n\n**Definitions**. Let $G$ be a po-group.\n\n-   $G$ is called an *interpolation group* if $G$ satisfies one of the\n    two equivalent conditions in the theorem above.\n\n-   $G$ is a *Riesz group* if $G$ is a directed interpolation group. By\n    directed we mean that $G$, as a poset, is a directed set.\n\n-   $G$ is an *antilattice* if $G$ is a Riesz group with the property\n    that if $a,b\\in G$ have a greatest lower bound, then $a$ and $b$ are\n    comparable.\n\nAny lattice-ordered group is an antilattice. Here is an interpolation\ngroup that is not an l-group. Let $G=\\mathbb{Z}\\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\nDefine $(a,b)\\le (c,d)$ iff $(c,d)-(a,b)=(0,n)$ for some non-negative\ninteger $n$. This order is a partial order. But $G$ is not a lattice,\nsince $(1,0)\\vee (0,0)$ does not exist. However, if any two elements in\n$G$ have either an upper bound or a lower bound, then the elements are\nin fact comparable. Therefore,\n$\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace \\le \\lbrace c,d\\rbrace$ means that $a,b,c,d$ form a\nchain. So any element in the interval $[a\\vee b,c\\wedge d]$\n\u201cinterpolates\u201d $\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace c,d\\rbrace$. Note that\n$G$ is not a Riesz group, for otherwise it would be a chain.",
