  "statement": "The purpose of this entry is to collect properties of well-ordered sets.\nWe denote all orderings uniformly by $\\leq$. If you are interested in\nhistory, have a look at\u00a0[@C].\n\nThe following properties are easy to see:\n\n-   If $A$ is a totally ordered set such that for every subset\n    $B\\subseteq A$ the set of all elements of $A$ strictly greater than\n    the elements of $B$,\n    $$B_>:=\\{a\\in A\\setminus B\\mid b\\leq a\\text{ for all }b\\in B\\},$$ is\n    either empty or has a least element, then $A$ is well-ordered.\n\n-   Every subset of a well-ordered set is well-ordered.\n\n-   If $A$ is well-ordered and $B$ is a poset such that there is a\n    bijective order morphism $\\varphi\\colon A\\to B$, then $B$ is\n    well-ordered.\n\nNow we define an important ingredient for understanding the structure of\nwell-ordered sets.\n\nLet $A$ be well-ordered. Then for every $a\\in A$ we define the *section*\nof $a$: $${\\widehat}{a}:=\\{b\\in A\\mid b\\leq a\\}.$$ A section is also\nknown as an *initial segment*. We denote the set of all sections of $A$\nby ${\\widehat}{A}$. This set is ordered by inclusion.\n\n\\[thm:AtosectionsofA\\] Let $A$ be a well-ordered set. Then the mapping\n${\\widehat}{\\cdot}\\colon\nA\\to{\\widehat}{A}$ defined by $a\\mapsto{\\widehat}{a}$ is a bijective\norder morphism. In particular, ${\\widehat}{A}$ is well-ordered.\n\nLet $a,b\\in A$ with $a\\leq b$. Then\n${\\widehat}{a}\\subseteq{\\widehat}{b}$, so ${\\widehat}{\\cdot}$ is an\norder morphism. Now assume that ${\\widehat}{a}={\\widehat}{b}$. If $a$\ndidn\u2019t equal $b$, we would have $b\\notin{\\widehat}{a}$, leading to a\ncontradiction. Therefore ${\\widehat}{\\cdot}$ is injective. Now let\n$C\\in{\\widehat}{A}$, then there exists a $c\\in A$ such that\n${\\widehat}{c}=C$, so ${\\widehat}{\\cdot}$ is surjective.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be well-ordered sets and $\\varphi\\colon A\\to B$ a\nbijective order morphism. Then there exists a bijective order morphism\n${\\widehat}{\\varphi}\\colon{\\widehat}{A}\\to{\\widehat}{B}$ such that for\nall $a\\in A$\n$${\\widehat}{\\varphi}({\\widehat}{a})={\\widehat}{\\varphi(a)}.$$\n\nSetting ${\\widehat}{\\varphi}({\\widehat}{a}):={\\widehat}{\\varphi(a)}$ is\nwell-defined by Theorem\u00a0\\[thm:AtosectionsofA\\]. The rest of the theorem\nfollows since ${\\widehat}{\\cdot}$ and $\\varphi$ are bijective order\nmorphisms.\n\n\\[thm:similarsection\\] Let $A$ be a well-ordered set and $a\\in A$ such\nthat there is an injective order morphism\n$\\varphi\\colon A\\to{\\widehat}{a}$. Then $A={\\widehat}{a}$.\n\nThe image of a section of $A$ under $\\varphi$ has a maximal element\nwhich in turn defines a smaller section of $A$. We may therefore define\nthe following two monotonically decreasing sequences of sets:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nB_0&:=\\varphi({\\widehat}{a}),&A_0&:=\\text{section defined by maximal element of\n}B_0,\\\\\nB_n&:=\\varphi(A_{n-1}),&A_n&:=\\text{section defined by maximal element\nof }B_n.\\end{aligned}$$ Now ${\\widehat}{A}$ is well-ordered, so the set\ndefined by the elements of the sequence $(A_n)$ has a minimal element,\nthat is $A_N=A_{N+1}$ and hence $B_N=B_{N+1}$ for some sufficiently\nlarge $N$. Applying $\\varphi^{-1}$ $N+1$ times to the latter equation\nyields ${\\widehat}{a}=A_0$, that is $a$ is the maximal element of $B$,\nand thus of $A$.\n\n\\[thm:uniquemorphism\\] Let $A$ and $B$ be well-ordered sets. Then there\nexists at most one bijective order morphism $\\varphi\\colon A\\to B$.\n\nLet $\\varphi,\\psi\\colon A\\to B$ be two bijective order morphisms. Let\n$a\\in A$ and set $b:=\\varphi(a)$ and $c:=\\psi(a)$. Then the restrictions\n$\\left.\\varphi\\right|_{{\\widehat}{a}}\\colon{\\widehat}{a}\\to{\\widehat}{b}$\nand\n$\\left.\\psi\\right|_{{\\widehat}{a}}\\colon{\\widehat}{a}\\to{\\widehat}{c}$\nare bijective order morphisms, so the restriction of $\\psi\\varphi^{-1}$\nto ${\\widehat}{b}$ is a bijective order morphism to ${\\widehat}{c}$. Now\neither ${\\widehat}{b}\\subseteq{\\widehat}{c}$ or\n${\\widehat}{c}\\subseteq{\\widehat}{b}$, so by\nTheorem\u00a0\\[thm:similarsection\\] ${\\widehat}{b}={\\widehat}{c}$, hence\n$b=c$ and thus $\\varphi=\\psi$.\n\n\\[thm:sectiontosection\\] Let $A$ and $B$ be well-ordered sets such that\nfor every section ${\\widehat}{a}\\in{\\widehat}{A}$ there is a bijective\norder morphism to a section ${\\widehat}{b}\\in{\\widehat}{B}$ and\nvice-versa, then there is a bijective order morphism\n$\\varphi\\colon A\\to B$.\n\nLet $a\\in A$ and let ${\\widehat}{b}\\in{\\widehat}{B}$ be a section such\nthat there is a bijective order morphism\n$\\psi_a\\colon{\\widehat}{a}\\to{\\widehat}{b}$. By\nTheorem\u00a0\\[thm:similarsection\\], ${\\widehat}{b}$ is unique, and so is\n$\\psi_a$ by Theorem\u00a0\\[thm:uniquemorphism\\]. Defining\n$\\varphi\\colon A\\to B$ by setting $\\varphi(a)=b$ gives therefore a\nwell-defined (by Theorem\u00a0\\[thm:AtosectionsofA\\]) and injective order\nmorphism. But $\\varphi$ is also surjective, since any $b\\in B$ maps\nuniquely to $A$ via ${\\widehat}{b}\\to{\\widehat}{a}$, and back again by\n$\\varphi$.\n\n\\[thm:comparable\\] Let $A$ and $B$ be well-ordered sets. Then there is\nan injective order morphism $\\iota\\colon A\\to B$ or\n$\\iota\\colon B\\to A$. If $\\iota$ cannot be chosen bijective, then it can\nat least be chosen such that its image is a section.\n\nLet ${\\widehat}{A}_0$ be the set of sections of $A$ from which there is\nan injective order morphism to $B$. If ${\\widehat}{A}_0$ is the empty\nset, then $B$ must be empty, since otherwise we could map the least\nelement of $A$ to $B$. If ${\\widehat}{A}_0$ is not empty, we may\nconsider the set $A_0:=\\cap{\\widehat}{A}_0$. If $A_0=A$, nothing remains\nto be shown. Otherwise the set $A\\setminus A_0$ is nonempty an hence has\na least element $a_0\\in A$. By construction, there is no injective order\nmorphism from ${\\widehat}{a}_0$ to $B$, but there is an injective order\nmorphism from $\\varphi_a\\colon{\\widehat}{a}\\to B$ for every element\n$a\\in A$ which is strictly smaller than $a_0$. Now assume there is an\nelement $b\\in B$ such that there is no injective order morphism from\n${\\widehat}{b}\\to\nA$. Then we can similarly construct a least element $b_0\\in B$ for which\nthere is no injective order morphism ${\\widehat}{b}_0\\to A$. Surely,\n$b_0$ is greater than all the elements from the images of the functions\n$\\varphi_a$, but then there is a bijective order morphism from\n${\\widehat}{a}_0$ to ${\\widehat}{b}_0$ by\nTheorem\u00a0\\[thm:sectiontosection\\] which is a contradiction. Therefore,\nall sections of $B$ and $B$ itself map injectively and order-preserving\nto $A$.\n\nLet $A$ be a well-ordered set and $B\\subseteq A$ a nonempty subset. Then\nthere is a bijective order morphism from $B$ to one of the sets in\n${\\widehat}{A}\\cup\\{A\\}$.\n\nThe set $B$ is well-ordered with respect to the order induced by $A$.\nAssume a bijective order morphism as stated by the theorem does not\nexist. Then, by virtue of Theorem\u00a0\\[thm:comparable\\], there is an\ninjective but not surjective order morphism $\\iota\\colon A\\to B$ whose\nimage is a section ${\\widehat}{b}\\in{\\widehat}{B}$. The element $b$\ndefines a section in ${\\widehat}{A}$ which is identical to $A$ by\nTheorem\u00a0\\[thm:similarsection\\]. Thus $\\iota$ is surjective which is a\ncontradiction.\n\n[C]{}\n\n<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">G.\u00a0Cantor</span>, Beitr\u00e4ge zur\nBegr\u00fcndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre (Zweiter Artikel),\n*Math.\u00a0Ann.*\u00a049, 207\u2013246 (1897).",
