  "definition": "A complete join-semilattice is a join-semilattice $L$ such that for any\nsubset $A\\subseteq L$, $\\bigvee A$, the arbitrary join operation on $A$,\nexists. Dually, a complete meet-semilattice is a meet-semilattice such\nthat $\\bigwedge A$ exists for any $A\\subseteq L$. Because there are no\nrestrictions placed on the subset $A$, it turns out that a complete\njoin-semilattice is a complete meet-semilattice, and therefore a\ncomplete lattice. In other words, by dropping the arbitrary join (meet)\noperation from a complete lattice, we end up with nothing new. For a\nproof of this, see . The crux of the matter lies in the fact that\n$\\bigvee$ ($\\bigwedge$) applies to *any* set, including $L$ itself, and\nthe empty set $\\varnothing$, so that $L$ always contains has a top and a\nbottom.\n\n**Variations**. To obtain new objects, one looks for variations in the\ndefinition of \u201ccomplete\u201d. For example, if we require that any\n$A\\subseteq L$ to be countable, we get what is a called a *countably\ncomplete join-semilattice* (or dually, a *countably complete\nmeet-semilattice*). More generally, if $\\kappa$ is any cardinal, then a\n$\\kappa$-complete join-semilattice is a semilattice $L$ such that for\nany set $A\\subseteq L$ such that $|A|\\le \\kappa$, $\\bigvee A$ exists. If\n$\\kappa$ is finite, then $L$ is just a join-semilattice. When\n$\\kappa=\\infty$, the only requirement on $A\\subseteq L$ is that it be\nnon-empty. In \\[1\\], a complete semilattice is defined to be a poset $L$\nsuch that for any non-empty $A\\subseteq L$, $\\bigwedge A$ exists, and\nany directed set $D\\subseteq L$, $\\bigvee D$ exists.\n\n**Example**. Let $A$ and $B$ be two isomorphic complete chains (a chain\nthat is a complete lattice) whose cardinality is $\\kappa$. Combine the\ntwo chains to form a lattice $L$ by joining the top of $A$ with the top\nof $B$, and the bottom of $A$ with the bottom of $B$, so that\n\n-   if $a\\le b$ in $A$, then $a\\le b$ in $L$\n\n-   if $c\\le d$ in $B$, then $c\\le d$ in $L$\n\n-   if $a\\in A$, $c\\in B$, then $a\\le c$ iff $a$ is the bottom of $A$\n    and $c$ is the top of $B$\n\n-   if $a\\in A$, $c\\in B$, then $c\\le a$ iff $a$ is the top of $A$ and\n    $c$ is the bottom of $B$\n\nNow, $L$ can be easily seen to be a $\\kappa$-complete lattice. Next,\nremove the bottom element of $L$ to obtain $L'$. Since, the meet\noperation no longer works on all pairs of elements of $L'$ while $\\vee$\nstill works, $L'$ is a join-semilattice that is not a lattice. In fact,\n$\\bigvee$ works on all subsets of $L'$. Since $|L'|=\\kappa$, we see that\n$L'$ is a $\\kappa$-complete join-semilattice.\n\n**Remark**. Although a complete semilattice is the same as a complete\nlattice, a homomorphism $f$ between, say, two complete join-semilattices\n$L_1$ and $L_2$, may fail to be a homomorphism between $L_1$ and $L_2$\nas complete lattices. Formally, a *complete join-semilattice\nhomomorphism* between two complete join-semilattices $L_1$ and $L_2$ is\na function $f:L_1\\to L_2$ such that for any subset $A\\subseteq L_1$, we\nhave $$f(\\bigvee A)=\\bigvee f(A)$$ where\n$f(A)=\\lbrace f(a)\\mid a\\in A\\rbrace$. Note that it is not required that\n$f(\\bigwedge A)=\\bigwedge f(A)$, so that $f$ needs not be a complete\nlattice homomorphism.\n\nTo give a concrete example where a complete join-semilattice\nhomomorphism $f$ fails to be complete lattice homomorphism, take $L$\nfrom the example above, and define $f:L\\to L$ by $f(a)=1$ if $a\\ne 0$\nand $f(0)=0$. Then for any $A\\subseteq L$, it is evident that\n$f(\\bigvee A)=\\bigvee f(A)$. However, if we take two incomparable\nelements $a,b\\in L$, then $f(a\\wedge b)=f(0)=0$, while\n$f(a)\\wedge f(b)= 1\\wedge 1=1$.\n\n[8]{} G. Gierz, K. H. Hofmann, K. Keimel, J. D. Lawson, M. W.
