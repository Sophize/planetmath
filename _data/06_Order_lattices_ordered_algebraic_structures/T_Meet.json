  "definition": "Certain posets $X$ have a binary operation *meet* denoted by $\\land$,\nsuch that $x \\land y$ is the greatest lower bound of $x$ and $y$. Such\nposets are called *meet-semilattices*, or *$\\land$-semilattices*, or\n*lower semilattices*.\n\nIf $m$ and $m'$ are both meets of $x$ and $y$, then $m \\leq m'$ and\n$m \\geq m'$, and so $m = m'$; thus a meet, if it exists, is unique. The\nmeet is also known as the *and operator*.",
