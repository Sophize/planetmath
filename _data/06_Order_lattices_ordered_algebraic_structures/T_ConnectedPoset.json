  "definition": "Let $P$ be a poset. Write $a\\perp b$ if either $a\\le b$ or $b\\le a$. In\nother words, $a\\perp b$ if $a$ and $b$ are comparable. A poset $P$ is\nsaid to be *connected* if for every pair $a,b\\in P$, there is a finite\nsequence $a=c_1, c_2,\\ldots, c_n=b$, with each $c_i\\in P$, such that\n$c_i\\perp c_{i+1}$ for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,n-1$.\n\nFor example, a poset with the property that any two elements are either\nbounded from above or bounded from below is a connected poset. In\nparticular, every semilattice is connected. A fence is always connected.\nIf $P$ has more than one element and contains an element that is both\nmaximal and minimal, then it is not connected. A *connected component*\nin a poset $P$ is a maximal connected subposet. In the last example, the\nmaximal-minimal point is a component in $P$. Any poset can be written as\na disjoint union of its components.\n\nIt is true that a poset is connected if its corresponding Hasse diagram\nis a connected graph. However, the converse is not true. Before we see\nan example of this, let us recall how to construct a Hasse diagram from\na poset $P$. The diagram so constructed is going to be an undirected\ngraph (since this is all we need in our discussion). Draw an edge\nbetween $a,b\\in P$ if either $a$ covers $b$ or $b$ covers $a$. Let us\ndenote this relation between $a$ and $b$ by $a \\asymp b$. Let $E$ be the\ncollection of all these edges. Then $G=(P,E)$ is a graph where elements\nof $P$ serve as vertices and $E$ as the constructed edges. From this\nconstruction, one sees that a finite path exists between $a,b\\in V(G)=P$\nif there is a finite sequence $a=d_0,d_1,\\ldots, d_m=b$, with each\n$d_i\\in V(G)$, such that $d_i\\asymp d_{i+1}$ for $i=1,\\ldots,m-1$. In\nother words, $a$ and $b$ can be \u201cjoined\u201d by a finite number of edges,\nsuch that $a$ is a vertex on the first edge and $b$ is the vertex on the\nlast edge.\n\nAs promised, here is an example of a connected poset whose underlying\nHasse diagram is not connected. take the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ with\n$\\infty$ adjoined to the right (meaning every element $r\\in \\mathbb{R}$\nis less than or equal to $\\infty$). Then the resulting poset is\nconnected, but its underlying Hasse diagram is not, since no element in\n$\\mathbb{R}$ can be joined to $\\infty$ by a finite path.",
