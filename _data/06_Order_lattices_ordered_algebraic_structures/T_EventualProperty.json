  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set and $P$ a property on the elements of $X$. Let\n$(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ be a net ($D$ a directed set) in $X$ (that is,\n$x_i\\in X$). As each $x_i\\in X$, $x_i$ either has or does not have\nproperty $P$. We say that the net $(x_i)$ has property $P$ *above*\n$j\\in D$ if $x_i$ has property $P$ for all $i\\ge j$. Furthermore, we say\nthat $(x_i)$ *eventually* has property $P$ if it has property $P$ above\nsome $j\\in D$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  Let $A$ and $B$ be non-empty sets. For $x\\in A$, let $P(x)$ be the\n    property that $x\\in B$. So $P$ is nothing more than the property of\n    elements being in the intersection of $A$ and $B$. A net\n    $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ eventually has $P$ means that for some $j\\in D$,\n    the set\n    $\\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in A\\mbox{, } i\\ge j \\rbrace \\subseteq B$. If\n    $D=\\mathbb{Z}$, then we have that $A$ and $B$ eventually coincide.\n\n2.  Now, suppose $A$ is a topological space, and $B$ is an open\n    neighborhood of a point $x\\in A$. For $y\\in A$, let $P_B(y)$ be the\n    property that $y\\in B$. Then a net $(x_i)$ has $P_B$ eventually for\n    every neighborhood $B$ of $x$ is a characterization of convergence\n    (to the point $x$, and $x$ is the accumulation point of $(x_i)$).\n\n3.  If $A$ is a poset and $B=\\lbrace x\\rbrace \\subseteq A$. For\n    $y\\in A$, let $P(y)$ again be the property that $y=x$. Let $(x_i)$\n    be a net that eventually has property $P$. In other words, $(x_i)$\n    is *eventually constant*. In particular, if for every chain $D$, the\n    net $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ is eventually constant in $A$, then we have a\n    characterization of the ascending chain condition in $A$.\n\n4.  **directed net**. Let $R$ be a preorder and let $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ be\n    a net in $R$. Let $x(D)$ be the image of the net:\n    $x(D)=\\lbrace x_i\\in R \\mid i\\in D\\rbrace$. Given a fixed $k\\in D$\n    and some $y\\in x(D)$, let $P_k(y)$ be the property (on $x(D)$) that\n    $x_k\\le y$. Let\n    $$S=\\lbrace k \\in D \\mid (x_i)\\mbox{ eventually has }P_k\\rbrace.$$\n    If $S=D$, then we say that the net $(x_i)$ is *directed*, or that\n    $(x_i)$ is a *directed net*. In other words, a directed net is a net\n    $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ such that for *every* $i\\in D$, there is a\n    $k(i)\\in D$, such that $x_i\\le x_j$ for all $j\\ge k(i)$.\n\n    If $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ is a directed net, then $x(D)$ is a directed\n    set: Pick $x_i,x_j\\in x(D)$, then there are $k(i),k(j)\\in D$ such\n    that $x_i\\le x_m$ for all $m\\ge k(i)$ and $x_j\\le x_n$ for all\n    $n\\ge k(j)$. Since $D$ is directed, there is a $t\\in D$ such that\n    $t\\ge k(i)$ and $t\\ge k(j)$. So $x_t\\ge x_{k(i)}\\ge x_i$ and\n    $x_t\\ge x_{k(j)}\\ge x_j$.\n\n    However, if $(x_i)_{i\\in D}$ is a net such that $x(D)$ is directed,\n    $(x_i)$ need not be a directed net. For example, let\n    $D=\\lbrace p,q,r\\rbrace$ such that $p\\le q\\le r$, and\n    $R=\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace$ such that $a\\le b$. Define a net $x:D\\to R$\n    by $x(p)=x(r)=b$ and $x(q)=a$. Then $x$ is not a directed net.\n\n**Remark**. The eventual property is a property on the class of nets (on\na given set $X$ and a given property $P$). We can write\n$\\operatorname{Eventually}(P,X)$ to denote its dependence on $X$ and\n$P$.",
