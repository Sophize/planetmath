  "definition": "Let $A$ be a Boolean algebra and $X\\subseteq A$ such that\n$\\langle X\\rangle = A$. In other words, $X$ is a set of generators of\n$A$. $A$ is said to be *freely generated by $X$*, or that $X$ is a *free\nset of generators of $A$*, if $\\langle X\\rangle =A$, and every function\n$f$ from $X$ to some Boolean algebra $B$ can be extended to a Boolean\nalgebra homomorphism $g$ from $A$ to $B$, as illustrated by the\ncommutative diagram below:\n\n$\n\\xymatrix@R-=2pt{\nX\\ar[dr]^f\\ar[dd]_i\\\\\n&B\\\\\nA\\ar[ur]_g\n}\n$\n\nwhere $i: X\\to A$ is the inclusion map. By extension of $f$ to $g$ we\nmean that $g(x)=f(x)$ for every $x\\in X$. Any subset $X\\subseteq A$\ncontaining $0$ (or $1$) can never be a free generating set for any\nsubalgebra of $A$, for any function $f:X\\to B$ such that $f(0)\\ne 0$ can\nnever be extended to a Boolean homomorphism.\n\nA Boolean algebra is said to be *free* if it has a free set of\ngenerators. If $A$ has $X$ as a free set of generators, $A$ is said to\nbe *free on* $X$. If $A$ and $B$ are both free on $X$, then $A$ and $B$\nare isomorphic. This means that free algebras are uniquely determined by\nits free generating set, up to isomorphisms.\n\nA simple example of a free Boolean algebra is the one freely generated\nby one element. Let $X$ be a singleton consisting of $a$. Then the set\n$A=\\lbrace 0,a,a',1\\rbrace$ is a Boolean algebra, with the obvious\nBoolean operations identified. Every function from $X$ to a Boolean\nalgebra $B$ singles out an element $b\\in B$ corresponding to $a$. Then\nthe function $g: A\\to B$ given by $g(a)=b$, $g(a')=b'$, $g(0)=0$, and\n$g(1)=1$ is clearly Boolean.\n\nThe two-element algebra $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ is also free, its free\ngenerating set being $\\varnothing$, the empty set, since the only\nfunction on $\\varnothing$ is $\\varnothing$, and thus can be extended to\nany function.\n\nIn general, if $X$ is finite, then the Boolean algebra freely generated\nby $X$ has cardinality $2^{2^{|X|}}$, where $|X|$ is the cardinality of\n$X$. If $X$ is infinite, then the cardinality of the Boolean algebra\nfreely generated by $X$ is $|X|$.",
