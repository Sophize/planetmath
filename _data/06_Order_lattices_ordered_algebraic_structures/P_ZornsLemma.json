Because this case is rather different from the case\nof non-empty chains, Zorn\u2019s Lemma is often stated in the following form:\nIf $X$ is a non-empty partially ordered set such that every non-empty\nchain in $X$ has an upper bound, then $X$ has a maximal element. (In\nother words: Any non-empty inductively ordered set has a maximal\nelement.)\n\nIn ZF, Zorn\u2019s Lemma is equivalent to the .",
