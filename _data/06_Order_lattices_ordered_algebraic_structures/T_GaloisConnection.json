  "definition": "The notion of a Galois connection has its root in Galois theory. By the\n, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields\nbetween a field $L$ and its subfield $F$ (with appropriate conditions\nimposed on the extension $L/F$), and the subgroups of the Galois group\n$\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)$ such that the bijection is\ninclusion-reversing:\n$$\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)\\supseteq H\\supseteq\\langle e \\rangle\\quad  \\mbox{ iff }\\quad F\\subseteq L^H\\subseteq L,\\mbox{ and}$$\n$$F\\subseteq K\\subseteq L\\quad\\mbox{ iff }\\quad \\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)\\supseteq \\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)\\supseteq\\langle e \\rangle.$$\n\nIf the language of Galois theory is distilled from the above paragraph,\nwhat remains reduces to a more basic and general concept in the theory\nof ordered-sets:\n\n**Definition**. Let $(P, \\le_P)$ and $(Q, \\le_Q)$ be two posets. A\n*Galois connection* between $(P,\\le_P)$ and $(Q,\\le_Q)$ is a pair of\nfunctions $f:=(f^*,f_*)$ with $f^*\\colon P\\to Q$ and $f_*\\colon Q\\to P$,\nsuch that, for all $p\\in P$ and $q\\in Q$, we have\n$$f^*(p)\\leq_Q q\\quad \\mbox{ iff }\\quad p\\leq_P f_*(q).$$ We denote a\nGalois connection between $P$ and $Q$ by $P\\stackrel{f}{\\multimap}Q$, or\nsimply $P\\multimap Q$.\n\nIf we define $\\le_P^{\\prime}$ on $P$ by $a\\le_P^{\\prime}b$ iff\n$b\\le_P a$, and define $\\le_Q^{\\prime}$ on $Q$ by $c\\le_Q^{\\prime}d$ iff\n$d\\le_Q c$, then $(P,\\le_P^{\\prime})$ and $(Q,\\le_Q^{\\prime})$ are\nposets, (the duals of $(P,\\le_P)$ and $(Q,\\le_Q)$). The existence of a\nGalois connection between $(P,\\le_P)$ and $(Q,\\le_Q)$ is the same as the\nexistence of a Galois connection between $(Q,\\le_Q^{\\prime})$ and\n$(P,\\le_P^{\\prime})$. In short, we say that there is a Galois connection\nbetween $P$ and $Q$ if there is a Galois connection between two posets\n$S$ and $T$ where $P$ and $Q$ are the underlying sets (of $S$ and $T$\nrespectively). With this, we may say without confusion that \u201ca Galois\nconnection exists between $P$ and $Q$ iff a Galois connection exists\nbetween $Q$ and $P$\u201d.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  Since $f^*(p)\\leq_Q f^*(p)$ for all $p\\in P$, then by definition,\n    $p\\leq_P f_*f^*(p)$. Alternatively, we can write $$\\begin{aligned}\n    1_P\\leq_P f_*f^*, \\end{aligned}$$ where $1_P$ stands for the\n    identity map on $P$. Similarly, if $1_Q$ is the identity map on $Q$,\n    then $$\\begin{aligned}\n    f^*f_*\\leq_Q 1_Q. \\end{aligned}$$\n\n2.  Suppose $a\\leq_P b$. Since $b\\leq_P f_*f^*(b)$ by the remark above,\n    $a\\leq_P f_*f^*(b)$ and so by definition, $f^*(a)\\leq_Q f^*(b)$.\n    This shows that $f^*$ is monotone. Likewise, $f_*$ is also monotone.\n\n3.  Now back to Inequality (1), $1_P\\leq_P f_*f^*$ in the first remark.\n    Applying the second remark, we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n    f^*\\leq_Q f^*f_*f^*. \\end{aligned}$$ Next, according to Inequality\n    (2), $f^*f_*(q)\\leq_Q q$ for any $q\\in Q$, it is true, in\n    particular, when $q=f^*(p)$. Therefore, we also have\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n    f^*f_*f^*\\leq_Q f^*.\\end{aligned}$$ Putting Inequalities (3) and (4)\n    together we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n    f^*f_*f^*=f^*.\\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, $$\\begin{aligned}\n    f_*f^*f_*=f_*.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n4.  If $(f,g)$ and $(f,h)$ are Galois connections between $(P,\\le_P)$\n    and $(Q,\\le_Q)$, then $g=h$. To see this, observe that $p\\le_P g(q)$\n    iff $f(p)\\le_Q q$ iff $p \\le_P h(q)$, for any $p\\in P$ and $q\\in Q$.\n    In particular, setting $p=g(q)$, we get $g(q)\\le_P h(q)$ since\n    $g(q)\\le_P g(q)$. Similarly, $h(q)\\le_P g(q)$, and therefore $g=h$.\n    By a similarly argument, if $(g,f)$ and $(h,f)$ are Galois\n    connections between $(P,\\le_P)$ and $(Q,\\le_Q)$, then $g=h$. Because\n    of this uniqueness property, in a Galois connection $f=(f^*,f_*)$,\n    $f^*$ is called *the upper adjoint* of $f_*$ and $f_*$ *the lower\n    adjoint* of $f^*$.\n\n**Examples.**\n\n-   The most famous example is already mentioned in the first paragraph\n    above: let $L$ is a finite-dimensional Galois extension of a field\n    $F$, and $G:=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/F)$ is the Galois group of $L$\n    over $F$. If we define\n\n    -   $P=\\lbrace K\\mid K\\mbox{ is a field such that }F\\subseteq K\\subseteq L \\rbrace,$\n        with $\\leq_P=\\subseteq$,\n\n    -   $Q=\\lbrace H\\mid H\\mbox{ is a subgroup of }G \\rbrace,$ with\n        $\\leq_Q=\\supseteq$,\n\n    -   $f^*:P\\to Q$ by $f^*(K)=\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$, and\n\n    -   $f_*:Q\\to P$ by $f_*(H)=L^H$, the fixed field of $H$ in $L$.\n\n    Then, by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, $f^*$ and $f_*$\n    are bijections, and $(f^*,f_*)$ is a Galois connection between $P$\n    and $Q$.\n\n-   Let $X$ be a topological space. Define $P$ be the set of all open\n    subsets of $X$ and $Q$ the set of all closed subsets of $X$. Turn\n    $P$ and $Q$ into posets with the usual set-theoretic inclusion.\n    Next, define $f^*:P\\to Q$ by $f^*(U)=\\overline{U}$, the closure of\n    $U$, and $f_*:Q\\to P$ by $f_*(V)=\\operatorname{int}(V)$, the\n    interior of $V$. Then $(f^*,f_*)$ is a Galois connection between $P$\n    and $Q$. Incidentally, those elements fixed by $f_*f^*$ are\n    precisely the regular open sets of $X$, and those fixed by $f^*f_*$\n    are the regular closed sets.\n\n**Remark**. The pair of functions in a Galois connection are order\npreserving as shown above. One may also define a Galois connection as a\npair of maps $f^*:P\\to Q$ and $f_*:Q\\to P$ such that $f^*(p)\\le_Q q$ iff\n$f_*(q)\\le_P p$, so that the pair $f^*,f_*$ are order reversing. In any\ncase, the two definitions are equivalent in that one may go from one\ndefinition to another, (simply exchange $Q$ with $Q^{\\partial}$, the of\n$Q$).\n\n[6]{} T.S.
