  "definition": "Let $P$ be a poset and $a,b\\in P$. $a$ is said to be *way below* $b$,\nwritten $a\\ll b$, if for any directed set $D\\subseteq P$ such that\n$\\bigvee D$ exists and that $b\\le \\bigvee D$, then there is a $d\\in D$\nsuch that $a\\le d$.\n\nFirst note that if $a\\ll b$, then $a\\le b$ since we can set\n$D=\\lbrace b\\rbrace$, and if $P$ is finite, we have the converse (since\n$\\bigvee D\\in D$). So, given any element $b\\in P$, what exactly are the\nelements that are way below $b$? Below are some examples that will throw\nsome light:\n\n**Examples**\n\n1.  Let $P$ be the poset given by the Hasse diagram below: $$\\xymatrix{\n    & & b \\ar@{.}[d] \\ar@{.}[dll] \\ar@{.}[dr] & \\\\\n    p \\ar@{-}[d] \\ar@{-}[dr] & & q \\ar@{-}[dl] \\ar@{-}[d] & r \\ar@{-}[dl] \\\\\n    s & t \\ar@{-}[d] & u \\ar@{-}[dl] \\\\\n    & v & & }$$ where the dotted lines denote infinite chains between\n    the end points. First, note that every element in $P$ is below\n    ($\\le$) $b$. However, only $v$ is way below $b$. $u$, for example,\n    is not way below $b$, because $D=\\lbrace x \\mid p\\le x< b \\rbrace$\n    is a directed set such that $\\bigvee D=b$ and non of the elements in\n    $D$ are above $u$. This illustrates the fact that if $P$ has a\n    bottom, it is way below everything else.\n\n2.  Suppose $P$ is a lattice. Then $a\\ll b$ iff for any set $D$ such\n    that $\\bigvee D$ exists and $b\\le \\bigvee D$, there is a finite\n    subset $F\\subseteq D$ such that $a\\le \\bigvee F$.\n\n    $(\\Rightarrow)$. Suppose $a\\ll b$. Let $D$ be the set in the\n    assumption. Let $E$ be the set of all finite joins of elements of\n    $D$. Then $D\\subseteq E$. Also, every element of $E$ is bounded\n    above by $\\bigvee D$. If $t$ is an upper bound of elements of $E$,\n    then it is certainly an upper bound of elements of $D$, and hence\n    $\\bigvee D\\le t$. So $\\bigvee D$ is the least upper bound of\n    elements of $E$, or $\\bigvee E=\\bigvee D$. Furthermore, $E$ is\n    directed. So there is an element $e\\in E$ such that $a\\le e$. But\n    $e=\\bigvee F$ for some finite subset of $D$, and this completes one\n    side of the proof.\n\n    $(\\Leftarrow)$. Let $D$ be a directed set such that $\\bigvee D$\n    exists and $b\\le \\bigvee D$. There is a finite subset $F$ of $D$\n    such that $a\\le \\bigvee F$. Since $D$ is directed, there is an\n    element $d\\in D$ such that $d$ is the upper bound of elements of\n    $F$. So $a\\le d$, completing the other side of the proof.\n\n3.  With the above assertion, we see that, for example, in the lattice\n    of subgroups $L(G)$ of a group $G$, $H\\ll K$ iff $H$ is finitely\n    generated. Other similar examples can be found in the lattice of\n    two-sided ideals of a ring, and the lattice of subspaces (projective\n    geometry) of a vector space.\n\n4.  In particular, if $P$ is a chain, then $a\\le b$ implies that\n    $a\\ll b$. If $D$ is a set such that $\\bigvee D$ exists and\n    $b\\le \\bigvee D$, then there is a $d\\in D$ such that $b\\le d$\n    (otherwise $b$ is an upper bound of elements of $D$ and\n    $\\bigvee D\\le b$), so $a\\le d$.\n\n5.  Here\u2019s an example where $a\\ll b$ in $P$ but $a$ is not the bottom of\n    $P$. Take two complete infinite chains $C_1$ and $C_2$ with bottom\n    $0$ and $1$, and let $P$ be their $P=C_1\\times C_2$. What elements\n    are way below $(1,1)$? First, take\n    $D=\\lbrace (a,1)\\mid 0\\le a<1 \\rbrace$. Since $P$ is complete,\n    $\\bigvee D=(1,1)$, but every element of $D$ is stricly less than\n    $(1,1)$, so $(1,1)$ is not way below itself. What about elements of\n    the form $(a,1)$, $a\\ne 1$? If we take\n    $D=\\lbrace (1,b)\\mid 0\\le b<1 \\rbrace$, then $\\bigvee D=(1,1)$ once\n    again. But no elements of $D$ are above $(a,1)$. So $(a,1)$ can not\n    be way below $(1,1)$. Similarly, neither can $(1,b)$ be way below\n    $(1,1)$. Finally, what about $(a,b)$ for $a<1$ and $b<1$? If $D$ is\n    a set with $\\bigvee D=(1,1)$, then $\\bigvee D_1=1$ and\n    $\\bigvee D_2=1$, where $D_1=\\lbrace x\\mid (x,1)\\in D\\rbrace$ and\n    $D_2=\\lbrace y\\mid (1,y)\\in D\\rbrace$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are\n    chains, $a\\le 1$ implies that there is an $s\\in D_1$ such that\n    $a\\le s$. Similarly, there is a $t\\in D_2$ such that $b\\le t$.\n    Together, $(a,b)\\le (s,t)\\in D$. So $(a,b)\\ll (1,1)$.\n\n6.  Let $X$ be a topological space and $L(X)$ be the lattice of open\n    sets in $X$. Suppose $U,V\\in L(X)$ and $U\\le V$. If there is a\n    compact subset $C$ such that $U\\subseteq C \\subseteq V$, then\n    $U\\ll V$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In a lattice $L$, $a\\ll a$ iff $a$ is a compact element. This\n    follows directly from the assertion above. In fact, a compact\n    element can be defined in a general poset as an element that is way\n    below itself.\n\n-   If we remove the condition that $D$ be directed in the definition\n    above, then $a$ is said to be *way way below* $b$.\n\n[8]{} G.
