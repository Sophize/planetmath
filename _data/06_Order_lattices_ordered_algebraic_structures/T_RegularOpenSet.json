  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space. A subset $A$ of $X$ is called a *regular\nopen* set if $A$ is equal to the interior of the closure of itself:\n$$A=\\operatorname{int}(\\overline{A}).$$ Clearly, every regular open set\nis open, and every clopen set is regular open.\n\n**Examples**. Let $\\mathbb{R}$ be the real line with the usual topology\n(generated by open intervals).\n\n-   $(a,b)$ is regular open whenever $-\\infty<a\\leq b<\\infty$.\n\n-   $(a,b)\\cup(b,c)$ is not regular open for $-\\infty<a\\leq b\n    \\leq c<\\infty$ and $a\\neq c$. The interior of the closure of\n    $(a,b)\\cup(b,c)$ is $(a,c)$.\n\nIf we examine the structure of $\\operatorname{int}(\\overline{A})$ a\nlittle more closely, we see that if we define\n$$A^{\\bot}:=X-\\overline{A},$$ then $$A^{\\bot\\bot}=\n\\operatorname{int}(\\overline{A}).$$ So an alternative definition of a\nregular open set is an open set $A$ such that $A^{\\bot\\bot}=A$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   For any $A\\subseteq X$, $A^{\\bot}$ is always open.\n\n-   $\\varnothing^{\\bot}=X$ and $X^{\\bot}=\\varnothing$.\n\n-   $A\\cap A^{\\bot}=\\varnothing$ and $A\\cup A^{\\bot}$ is dense in $X$.\n\n-   $A^{\\bot}\\cup B^{\\bot}\\subseteq(A\\cap\n    B)^{\\bot}$ and $A^{\\bot}\\cap B^{\\bot}=(A\\cup B)^{\\bot}$.\n\n-   It can be shown that if $A$ is open, then $A^{\\bot}$ is regular\n    open. As a result, following from the first property,\n    $\\operatorname{int}(\\overline{A})$, being $A^{\\bot\\bot}$, is regular\n    open for any subset $A$ of $X$.\n\n-   In addition, if both $A$ and $B$ are regular open, then $A\\cap\n    B$ is regular open.\n\n-   It is not true, however, that the union of two regular open sets is\n    regular open, as illustrated by the second example above.\n\n-   It can also be shown that the set of all regular open sets of a\n    topological space $X$ forms a Boolean algebra under the following\n    set of operations:\n\n    1.  $1=X$ and $0=\\varnothing$,\n\n    2.  $a\\land b=a\\cap b$,\n\n    3.  $a\\lor b=(a\\cup b)^{\\bot\\bot}$, and\n\n    4.  $a^{\\prime}=a^{\\bot}$.\n\n    This is an example of a Boolean algebra coming from a collection of\n    subsets of a set that is not formed by the standard set operations\n    union $\\cup$, intersection $\\cap$, and complementation $^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe definition of a regular open set can be dualized. A closed set $A$\nin a topological space is called a *regular closed set* if\n$A=\\overline{\\operatorname{int}(A)}$.\n\n[\\[AHU\\]]{} P. Halmos (1970).
