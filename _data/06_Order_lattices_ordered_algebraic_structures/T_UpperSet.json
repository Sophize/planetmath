  "definition": "Let $P$ be a poset and $A$ a subset of $P$. The *upper set* of $A$ is\ndefined to be the set\n$$\\lbrace b\\in P\\mid a\\le b \\mbox{ for some } a\\in A\\rbrace,$$ and is\ndenoted by ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$. In other words, ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$ is the\nset of all upper bounds of elements of $A$.\n\n$\\uparrow$ can be viewed as a unary operator on the power set $2^P$\nsending $A\\in 2^P$ to ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A \\in 2^P$. $\\uparrow$ has the\nfollowing properties\n\n1.  ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}\\varnothing=\\varnothing$,\n\n2.  $A\\subseteq {\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$,\n\n3.  $\\uparrow {\\uparrow\\!\\!}A={\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$, and\n\n4.  if $A\\subseteq B$, ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A\\subseteq {\\uparrow\\!\\!}B$.\n\nSo $\\uparrow$ is a closure operator.\n\nAn *upper set* in $P$ is a subset $A$ such that its upper set is itself:\n${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A=A$. In other words, $A$ is closed with respect to $\\le$\nin the sense that if $a\\in A$ and $a\\le b$, then $b\\in A$. An upper set\nis also said to be *upper closed*. For this reason, for any subset $A$\nof $P$, the ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$ is also called the *upper closure* of $A$.\n\nDually, the *lower set* (or *lower closure*) of $A$ is the set of all\nlower bounds of elements of $A$. The lower set of $A$ is denoted by\n${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$. If the lower set of $A$ is $A$ itself, then $A$ is\na called a *lower set*, or a *lower closed set*.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$ is *not* the same as the set of upper bounds of\n    $A$, commonly denoted by $A^u$, which is defined as the set\n    $\\lbrace b\\in P\\mid a\\le b\\mbox{ for \\emph{all} }a\\in A\\rbrace$.\n    Similarly, ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A\\neq A^{\\ell}$ in general, where\n    $A^{\\ell}$ is the set of lower bounds of $A$.\n\n-   When $A=\\lbrace x\\rbrace$, we write ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$ for\n    ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}A$ and ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ for ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$.\n    ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}x = \\lbrace x\\rbrace ^u$ and\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x=\\lbrace x\\rbrace ^d$.\n\n-   If $P$ is a lattice and $x\\in P$, then ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$ is the\n    principal filter generated by $x$, and ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is the\n    principal ideal generated by $x$.\n\n-   If $A$ is a lower set of $P$, then its set complement\n    $A^{\\complement}$ is an upper set: if $a\\in A^{\\complement}$ and\n    $a\\le b$, then $b\\in A^{\\complement}$ by a contrapositive argument.\n\n-   Let $P$ be a poset. The set of all lower sets of $P$ is denoted by\n    $\\mathcal{O}(P)$. It is easy to see that $\\mathcal{O}(P)$ is a poset\n    (ordered by inclusion), and\n    $\\mathcal{O}(P)^{\\partial}=\\mathcal{O}(P^{\\partial})$, where\n    $^{\\partial}$ is the dualization operation (meaning that\n    $P^{\\partial}$ is the dual poset of $P$).",
