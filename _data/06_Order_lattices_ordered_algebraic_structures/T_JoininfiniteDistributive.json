  "definition": "A lattice $L$ is said to be *join-infinite distributive* if it is\ncomplete, and for any element $x \\in L$ and any subset $M$ of $L$, we\nhave\n$$x\\wedge \\bigvee M =\\bigvee \\lbrace x\\wedge y \\mid y \\in M\\rbrace.$$\nEquation (1) is called the *join-infinite identity*, or *JID* for short.\nWe also call $L$ a JID lattice.\n\nIf $M$ is any two-element set, then we see that the equation above is\njust one of the distributive laws, and hence any JID lattice is\ndistributive. The converse of this statement is false. For example, take\nthe set $N$ of non-negative integers ordered by division, that is,\n$a\\le b$ iff $a\\mid b$. Then $N$ is a distributive lattice. However, $N$\nfails JID, for if $M$ is the set of all odd primes, then $\\bigvee M=0$,\nso $2\\wedge (\\bigvee M) = 2$, where as\n$\\bigvee \\lbrace 2\\wedge p \\mid p\\in M\\rbrace = \\bigvee \\lbrace 1\\rbrace  = 1\\ne 2$.\n\nAlso any completely distributive lattice is JID. The converse of this is\nalso false. For an example of a JID lattice that is not completely\ndistributive, see the last paragraph below before the remarks.\n\nDually, a lattice $L$ is said to be *meet-infinite distributive* if it\nis complete, and for any element $x \\in L$ and any subset $M$ of $L$, we\nhave\n$$x\\vee \\bigwedge M =\\bigwedge \\lbrace x\\vee y \\mid y \\in M\\rbrace.$$\nEquation (2) is called the *meet-infinite identity*, or *MID* for short.\n$L$ is also called a MID lattice.\n\nNow, unlike the case with a distributive lattice, where one distributive\nlaw implies its dual, JID does not necessarily imply MID, and vice\nversa. An example of a lattice satisfying MID but not JID can be found .\nThe dual of this lattice then satisfies JID but not MID, and therefore\nis an example of a JID lattice that is not completely distributive. When\na lattice is both join-infinite and meet-infinite distributive, it is\nsaid to be *infinite distributive*.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   It can be shown that any complete Boolean lattice is infinite\n    distributive.\n\n-   An intermediate concept between distributivity and\n    infinite-distributivity is that of countable-distributivity: a\n    lattice is *join-countable distributive* if JID holds for all\n    countable subsets $M$ of $L$, and *meet-countable distributive* if\n    MID holds for all countable $M\\subseteq L$.\n\n-   When the sets $M$ in JID are restricted to filtered sets, then the\n    lattice $L$ is join continuous. When $M$ are directed sets in MID,\n    then $L$ is meet continuous.",
