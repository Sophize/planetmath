  "definition": "Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra, and $B^*$ the set of all maximal ideals of\n$B$. In this entry, we will equip $B^*$ with a topology so it is a\nBoolean space.\n\n**Definition**. For any $a\\in B$, define\n$M(a):=\\lbrace M\\in B^* \\mid a\\notin M\\rbrace$, and\n$\\mathcal{B}:=\\lbrace M(a)\\mid a\\in B\\rbrace$.\n\nIt is know that in a Boolean algebra, maximal ideals and prime ideals\ncoincide. From , we have the three following properties concerning\n$M(a)$:\n$$M(a)\\cap M(b)=M(a\\wedge b), \\qquad M(a)\\cup M(b)=M(a\\vee b), \\qquad B^*-M(a)=M(a').$$\nFurthermore, if $M(a)=M(b)$, then $a=b$.\n\nFrom these properties, we see that $M(0)=\\varnothing$ and $M(1)=B^*$. As\na result, we see that\n\n$B^*$ is a topological space, whose topology $\\mathcal{T}$ is generated\nby the basis $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n$\\varnothing$ and $B^*$ are both open, as they are $M(0)$ and $M(1)$\nrespectively. Also, the intersection of open sets $M(a)$ and $M(b)$ is\nagain open, since it is $M(a\\wedge b)$.\n\nWe may in fact treat $\\mathcal{B}$ as a subbasis for $\\mathcal{T}$,\nsince finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal{B}$ remain in\n$\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nEach member of $\\mathcal{B}$ is closed, hence $\\mathcal{T}$ is generated\nby a basis of clopen sets. In other words, $B^*$ is zero-dimensional.\n\nEach $M(a)$ is open, by definition, and closed, since it is the\ncomplement of the open set $M(a')$.\n\n$B^*$ is Hausdorff.\n\nIf $M,N\\in B^*$ such that $M\\ne N$, then there is some $a\\in B$ such\nthat $a\\in M$ and $a\\notin N$. This means that $N\\in M(a)$ and\n$M\\notin M(a)$, which means that $M\\in B^*-M(a)=M(a')$. Since $M(a)$ and\n$M(a')$ are open and disjoint, with $N\\in M(a)$ and $M\\in M(a')$, we see\nthat $B^*$ is Hausdorff.\n\nNow, based on a topological fact, every zero-dimensional Hausdorff space\nis totally disconnected. Hence $B^*$ is totally disconnected.\n\n$B^*$ is compact.\n\nSuppose $\\lbrace U_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a collection of open sets\nwhose union is $B^*$. Since each $U_i$ is a union of elements of\n$\\mathcal{B}$, we might as well assume that $B^*$ is covered by elements\nof $\\mathcal{B}$. In other words, we may assume that each $U_i$ is some\n$M(a_i)\\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nLet $J$ be the ideal generated by the set\n$\\lbrace a_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$. If $J\\ne B$, then $J$ can be extended\nto a maximal ideal $M$. Since each $a_i\\in M$, we see that\n$M\\notin M(a_i)$, so that\n$M \\notin \\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_i) \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace = B^*$, which is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, $J=B$. In particular, $1\\in J$, which means\nthat $1$ can be expressed as the join of a finite number of the $a_i$\u2019s:\n$$1= \\bigvee \\lbrace a_i \\mid i \\in K\\rbrace,$$ where $K$ is a finite\nsubset of $J$. As a result, we have\n$$\\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_i)\\mid i\\in K\\rbrace = M(\\bigvee \\lbrace a_i \\mid i\\in K \\rbrace )=M(1)=B^*.$$\nSo $B^*$ has a finite subcover, and hence is compact.\n\nCollecting the last three results, we see that $B^*$ is a Boolean space.\n\n**Remark**. It can be shown that $B$ is isomorphic to the Boolean\nalgebra of clopen sets in $B^*$. This is the famous Stone representation\ntheorem.",
