  "definition": "Let $P$ be a poset. Consider the set $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$ of all order\nideals of $P$.\n\n$\\operatorname{Id}(P)$ is an algebraic dcpo, such that $P$ can be\nembedded in.\n\nWe shall list, and when necessary, prove the following series of facts\nwhich ultimately prove the main assertion. For convenience, write\n$P'=\\operatorname{Id}(P)$.\n\n1.  $P'$ is a poset with $\\le$ defined by set theoretic inclusion.\n\n2.  For any $x\\in P$, ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\in P'$.\n\n3.  $P$ can be embedded in $P'$. The function $f:P\\to P'$ defined by\n    $f(x)={\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is order preserving and one-to-one. If\n    $x\\le y$, and $a\\le x$, then $a\\le y$, hence\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\subseteq {\\downarrow\\!\\!}y$. If\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x={\\downarrow\\!\\!}y$, we have that $x\\le y$ and\n    $y\\le x$, so $x=y$, since $\\le$ is antisymmetric.\n\n4.  $P'$ is a dcpo. Suppose $D$ is a directed set in $P'$. Let\n    $E=\\bigcup D$. For any $x,y\\in E$, $x\\in I$ and $y\\in J$ for some\n    ideals $I,J\\in D$. As $D$ is directed, there is $K\\in D$ such that\n    $I\\subseteq K$ and $J\\subseteq K$. So $x,y\\in K$ and hence there is\n    $z\\in K\\subseteq E$ such that $x\\le z$ and $y\\le z$. This shows that\n    $E$ is directed. Next, suppose $x\\in E$ and $y\\le x$. Then $x\\in I$\n    for some $I\\in D$, so $y\\in I\\subseteq E$ as well. This shows that\n    $E$ is a down set. So $E$ is an ideal of $P$: $\\bigvee D=E\\in P'$.\n\n5.  For every $x\\in P$, ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is a compact element of\n    $P'$. If ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\le \\bigvee D$, where $D$ is directed in\n    $P'$, then ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\subseteq \\bigcup D$, or\n    $x\\in \\bigcup D$, which implies $x\\in I$ for some ideal $I\\in D$.\n    Therefore ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\subseteq I$, and ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is\n    way below itself: ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is compact.\n\n6.  $P'$ is an algebraic dcpo. Let $I\\in P'$. Let\n    $C=\\lbrace {\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\mid x\\in I\\rbrace$. For any $x,y\\in I$,\n    there is $z\\in I$ such that $x\\le z$ and $y\\le z$. This shows that\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\le {\\downarrow\\!\\!}z$ and\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}y\\le {\\downarrow\\!\\!}z$ in $C$, so that $C$ is\n    directed. It is easy to see that $I=\\bigvee C$. Since $I$ is a join\n    of a directed set consisting of compact elements, $P'$ is algebraic.\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n**Definition**. $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$ is called the *ideal completion*\nof $P$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   In general, the ideal completion of a poset is not a complete\n    lattice. It is complete in the sense of being directed complete.\n    This is different from another type of completion, called the\n    MacNeille completion of $P$, which is a complete lattice.\n\n-   If $P$ is an upper semilattice, then so is $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$.\n    In fact, the join of any non-empty family of ideals exists.\n    Furthermore, if $P$ has a bottom element $0$, then\n    $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$ is a complete lattice.\n\n    Let $S$ be a non-empty family of ideals in $P$. Let $A$ be the set\n    of $P$ consisting of all finite joins of elements of those ideals in\n    $S$, and $B={\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$. Clearly, $B$ is a lower set. For\n    every $a,b\\in B$, we have $c,d\\in A$ such that $a\\le c$ and\n    $b\\le d$. Since $c$ and $d$ are both finite joins of elements of\n    those ideals in $S$, so is $c\\vee d$. Since $a\\le c\\vee d$ and\n    $b\\le c\\vee d$, $B$ is directed. If $I$ is any ideal larger than any\n    of the ideals in $S$, clearly $A\\subseteq I$, since $I$ is directed.\n    So $B={\\downarrow\\!\\!}A\\subseteq {\\downarrow\\!\\!}I=I$. Therefore,\n    $B=\\bigvee S$.\n\n    If $0\\in P$, then $\\langle 0\\rangle$, the bottom of\n    $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$, is the join of the empty family of ideals in\n    $P$. By , $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$ is a complete lattice.\n\n-   If $P$ is a lower semilattice, then so is $\\operatorname{Id}(P)$.\n\n    Let $I,J$ be two ideals in $P$ and $K=I\\cap J$. By definition, $I$\n    and $J$ are non-empty, so let $a\\in I$ and $b\\in J$. As $P$ is a\n    lower semilattice, $c:=a\\wedge b$ exists and $c\\le a$ and $c\\le b$.\n    So $c \\in I\\cap J$, and that $K=I\\cap J$ is non-empty. If\n    $x\\le y\\in K$, then $x\\le y\\in I$ or $x\\in I$. Similarly $x\\in J$.\n    Therefore $x\\in I\\cap J=K$ and $K$ is a lower set. If $r,s\\in K$,\n    then there is $u\\in I$ and $v\\in J$ such that $r,s\\le u,v$. So\n    $r,s\\le u\\wedge v$ and $K$ is directed. This means that\n    $I\\cap J\\in \\operatorname{Id}(P)$.\n\n[8]{} G. Gierz, K. H. Hofmann, K. Keimel, J. D. Lawson, M. W. Mislove,\nD. S.
