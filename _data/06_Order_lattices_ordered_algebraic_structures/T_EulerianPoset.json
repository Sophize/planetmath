  "definition": "A graded poset $P$ is [*Eulerian*]{} if for any $x\\le y$ in $P$, the of\nthe interval $[x,y]$ is given by $$\\mu_P(x,y)=(-1)^{\\rho(y)-\\rho(x)},$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the rank function of $P$. If $P$ is finite and graded\nwith strictly positive rank, then we can equivalently and more simply\nsay that $P$ is Eulerian if and only if each nontrivial interval of $P$\nhas the same number of elements of even rank as odd rank.\n\nFor example, the $M_3$ is not Eulerian, because it has 3 elements of\nrank 1 but only 2 elements of ranks 0 or 2. $$\\xymatrix{\n             & \\widehat{1}\\ar@{-}[dl]\\ar@{-}[d]\\ar@{-}[dr] & \\\\\na\\ar@{-}[dr] & b\\ar@{-}[d] & c\\ar@{-}[dl] \\\\\n             & \\widehat{0} &\n}$$ On the other hand, the Boolean lattice $B_n$ is always Eulerian.\n$$\\xymatrix{\n             & \\widehat{1}\\ar@{-}[dl]\\ar@{-}[d]\\ar@{-}[dr] & \\\\\nab\\ar@{-}[d]\\ar@{-}[dr] & ac\\ar@{-}[dl]\\ar@{-}[dr] & bc\\ar@{-}[dl]\\ar@{-}[d] \\\\\na\\ar@{-}[dr] & b\\ar@{-}[d] & c\\ar@{-}[dl] \\\\\n             & \\widehat{0} &\n}$$ Each interval of $B_n$ is isomorphic to a smaller Boolean lattice,\nso we can give a proof by induction that $B_n$ is Eulerian. Now $B_0$ is\na single point and so there is only one interval, which has M\u00f6bius\nfunction 1. So to show that $B_n$ is Eulerian, we just need to show that\nthe M\u00f6bius function of $B_n$ is $(-1)^n$. Recall that by definition,\n$$\\mu_{B_n}(B_n) = - \\sum_{S\\subset\\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\mu(\\emptyset,S)\\tag{*}$$\nThus $\\sum_{S\\subseteq\\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\mu_{B_n}(\\emptyset,S)=0$. We can\napply the binomial theorem to $0$ to see that\n$0=(-1+1)^n=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k$ and thus $$\\begin{aligned}\n(-1)^n        &= - \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k \\\\\n              &= - \\sum_{S\\subset\\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\mu(\\emptyset,S)\\tag{**}\\end{aligned}$$\nIt then follows from Equation\u00a0$(*)$ and Equation\u00a0$(**)$ that\n$\\mu(B_n)=(-1)^n$.\n\nEulerian posets are generalizations of certain special posets, such as\nface lattices of polytopes.\n\nEulerian posets of small rank {#eulerian-posets-of-small-rank .unnumbered}\n=============================\n\nIn this section we classify bounded Eulerian posets of rank less than 4.\n\nFor $n<2$, there is exactly one bounded poset of rank $n$, the chain,\nand it is Eulerian.\n\nA bounded poset of rank $2$ is determined precisely by its number of\ncoatoms. The ab-index of a rank $2$ bounded Eulerian poset with $r$\ncoatoms is $a + (r-1)b$, which is a cd-index if and only if $r=2$. Since\nevery Eulerian poset has a cd-index, this implies that every rank $2$\nbounded Eulerian poset has exactly two coatoms. Thus up to isomorphism\n$B_2$ is the only rank $2$ bounded Eulerian poset.\n\nLet $P$ be a rank $3$ bounded Eulerian poset. Since $P$ has as many\nelements of odd rank as even rank, it has exactly the same number of\natoms as coatoms. Since every rank $2$ interval in $P$ is a copy of\n$B_2$, it follows that $P$ is not a chain and so has $n\\ge 2$ atoms.\nMoreover, every atom is covered by exactly two coatoms, and every coatom\ncovers exactly two atoms. That is, the Hasse diagram of the interior of\n$P$ is a 2-regular bipartite graph. This graph admits a decomposition\ninto even cycles. In each cycle, half of the nodes are atoms and half\nare coatoms. The non-induced subposet of $P$ consisting of the points on\na cycle of length $2k$ plus the minimum and maximum elements of $P$ is\nthe face poset of a $k$-gon. Hence $P$ itself is the face poset of the\ndisjoint union of one or more $k$-gons for various $k\\ge 2$.\n\n[1]{} Stanley, R., *Enumerative Combinatorics*, vol. 1, 2nd ed.,\nCambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996.",
