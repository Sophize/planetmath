  "definition": "Let $A$ be a Boolean algebra. A *measure* on $A$ is a non-negative\nextended real-valued function $m$ defined on $A$ such that\n\n1.  there is an $a\\in A$ such that $m(a)$ is a real number (not\n    $\\infty$),\n\n2.  if $a\\wedge  b=0$, then $m(a\\vee b)=m(a)+m(b)$.\n\nFor example, a sigma algebra $\\mathcal{B}$ over a set $E$ is a Boolean\nalgebra, and a $\\mu$ on the measurable space $(\\mathcal{B},E)$ is a\nmeasure on the Boolean algebra $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nThe following are some of the elementary properties of $m$:\n\n-   $m(0)=0$.\n\n    By condition 1, suppose $m(a)=r\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then\n    $m(a)=m(0\\vee a)=m(0)+m(a)$, so that $m(0)=0$.\n\n-   $m$ is non-decreasing: $m(a)\\le m(b)$ for $a\\le b$\n\n    If $a\\le b$, then $c=b-a$ and $a$ are disjoint ($c\\wedge a=0$) and\n    $b=c\\vee a$. So $m(b)=m(c\\vee a)=m(c)+m(a)$. As a result,\n    $m(a)\\le m(b)$.\n\n-   $m$ is subadditive: $m(a\\vee b)\\le m(a)+m(b)$.\n\n    Since $a\\vee b=(a-b)\\vee b$, and $a-b$ and $b$ are disjoint, we have\n    that $m(a\\vee b)=m((a-b)\\vee b)=m(a-b)+m(b)$. Since $a-b\\le a$, the\n    result follows.\n\nFrom the three properties above, one readily deduces that\n$I:=\\lbrace a\\in A\\mid m(a)=0\\rbrace$ is a Boolean ideal of $A$.\n\nA measure on $A$ is called a *two-valued measure* if $m$ maps onto the\ntwo-element set $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$. Because of the existence of an\nelement $a\\in A$ with $m(a)=1$, it follows that $m(1)=1$. Consequently,\nthe set $F:=\\lbrace a\\in A \\mid m(a)=1\\rbrace$ is a Boolean filter. In\nfact, because $m$ is two-valued, $F$ is an ultrafilter (and\ncorrespondingly, the set $\\lbrace a\\mid m(a)=0\\rbrace$ is a maximal\nideal).\n\nConversely, given an ultrafilter $F$ of $A$, the function\n$m:A\\to \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, defined by $m(a)=1$ iff $a\\in F$, is a\ntwo-valued measure on $A$. To see this, suppose $a\\wedge b=0$. Then at\nleast one of them, say $a$, can not be in $F$ (or else\n$0=a\\wedge b\\in F$). This means that $m(a)=0$. If $b\\in F$, then\n$a\\vee b\\in F$, so that $m(a\\vee b)=1=m(b)=m(b)+m(a)$. On the other\nhand, if $b\\notin F$, then $a',b'\\in F$, so $a'\\wedge b'\\in F$, or\n$a\\vee b\\notin F$. This means that $m(a\\vee b)=0=m(a)+m(b)$.\n\n**Remark**. A measure (on a Boolean algebra) is sometimes called\n*finitely additive* to emphasize the defining condition 2 above. In\naddition, this terminology is used when there is a need to contrast a\nstronger form of additivity: *countable additivity*. A measure is said\nto be *countably additive* if whenever $K$ is a countable set of\npairwise disjoint elements in $A$ such that $\\bigvee K$ exists, then\n$$m(\\bigvee K)=\\sum_{a\\in K} m(a).$$",
