  "definition": "A *topological vector lattice* $V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ is\n\n-   a Hausdorff topological vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$,\n\n-   a vector lattice, and\n\n-   *locally solid*. This means that there is a neighborhood base of $0$\n    consisting of solid sets.\n\nA topological vector lattice $V$ is a topological lattice.\n\nBefore proving this, we show the following equivalence on the continuity\nof various operations on a vector lattice $V$ that is also a topological\nvector space.\n\nLet $V$ be a vector lattice and a topological vector space. The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n1.  $\\vee:V^2\\to V$ is continuous (simultaneously in both arguments)\n\n2.  $\\wedge:V^2\\to V$ is continuous (simultaneously in both arguments)\n\n3.  $^+:V\\to V$ given by $x^+:=x\\vee 0$ is continuous\n\n4.  $^-:V\\to V$ given by $x^-:=-x\\vee 0$ is continuous\n\n5.  $|\\cdot|:V\\to V$ given by $|x|:=-x\\vee x$ is continuous\n\n$(1\\Leftrightarrow 2)$. If $\\vee$ is continuous, then\n$x\\wedge y=x+y-x\\vee y$ is continuous too, as $+$ and $-$ are both\ncontinuous under a topological vector space. This proof works in reverse\ntoo. $(1\\Rightarrow 3)$, $(1\\Rightarrow 4)$, and $(3\\Leftrightarrow 4)$\nare obvious. To see $(4\\Rightarrow 5)$, we see that $|x|=x^++x^-$, since\n$^-$ is continuous, $^+$ is continuous also, so that $|\\cdot|$ is\ncontinuous. To see $(5\\Rightarrow 4)$, we use the identity $x=x^+-x^-$,\nso that $|x|=(x+x^-)+x^-$, which implies $x^-=\\frac{1}{2}(|x|-x)$ is\ncontinuous. Finally, $(3\\Rightarrow 1)$ is given by\n$x\\vee y=(x-y+y)\\vee (0+y)=(x-y)\\vee 0+y=(x-y)^++y$, which is\ncontinuous.\n\nIn addition, we show an important inequality that is true on any vector\nlattice:\n\nLet $V$ be a vector lattice. Then $|a^+-b^+|\\le |a-b|$ for any\n$a,b\\in V$.\n\n$|a^+-b^+|=(b^+-a^+)\\vee (a^+-b^+)=(b\\vee 0-a\\vee 0)\\vee(a\\vee 0-b\\vee 0)$.\nNext,\n$a\\vee 0 - b\\vee 0 = (b+(-a\\wedge 0)\\vee (-a\\wedge 0)=((b-a)\\wedge b)\\vee (-a\\wedge 0)$\nso that\n$|a^+-b^+|=((b-a)\\wedge b)\\vee (-a\\wedge 0)\\vee ((a-b)\\wedge a)\\vee (-b\\wedge 0)\\le (b-a)\\vee (-a\\wedge 0)\\vee (a-b)\\vee (-b\\wedge 0)$.\nSince $(b-a)\\vee (a-b)=|a-b|$ and $a\\vee 0$ are both in the positive\ncone of $V$, so is their sum, so that\n$0\\le (b-a)\\vee (a-b)+(a\\vee 0)=(b-a)\\vee (a-b)-(-a\\wedge 0)$, which\nmeans that $(-a\\wedge 0)\\le (b-a)\\vee (a-b)$. Similarly,\n$(-b\\wedge 0)\\le (b-a)\\vee (a-b)$. Combining these two inequalities, we\nsee that\n$|a^+-b^+|\\le (b-a)\\vee (-a\\wedge 0)\\vee (a-b)\\vee (-b\\wedge 0) \\le (b-a)\\vee (a-b)=|a-b|$.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the main assertion.\n\nTo show that $V$ is a topological lattice, we need to show that the\nlattice operations meet $\\wedge$ and join $\\vee$ are continuous, which,\nby Lemma 1, is equivalent in showing, say, that $^+$ is continuous.\nSuppose $N$ is a neighborhood base of 0 consisting of solid sets. We\nprove that $^+$ is continuous. This amounts to showing that if $x$ is\nclose to $x_0$, then $x^+$ is close to $x_0^+$, which is the same as\nsaying that if $x-x_0$ is in a solid neighborhood $U$ of $0$ ($U\\in N$),\nthen so is $x^+-x_0^+$ in $U$. Since $x-x_0\\in U$, $|x-x_0|\\in U$. But\n$|x^+-x_0^+|\\le |x-x_0|$ by Lemma 2, and $U$ is solid, $x^+-x_0^+\\in U$\nas well, and therefore $^+$ is continuous.\n\nAs a corollary, we have\n\nA topological vector lattice is an ordered topological vector space.\n\nAll we need to show is that the positive cone is a closed set. But the\npositive cone is defined as\n$\\lbrace x\\mid 0\\le x\\rbrace = \\lbrace x\\mid x^-=0\\rbrace$, which is\nclosed since $^-$ is continuous, and the positive cone is the inverse\nimage of a singleton, a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$.",
