  "definition": "A lattice $L$ is said to be *completely distributive* if it is a\ncomplete lattice such that, given any sets $K\\subseteq I\\times J$ such\nthat $K$ projects onto $I$, and any subset\n$\\lbrace x_{ij} \\mid (i,j)\\in K \\rbrace$ of $L$,\n$$\\bigwedge_{i\\in I}(\\bigvee_{j\\in K(i)} x_{ij})=\\bigvee_{f\\in A}(\\bigwedge_{i\\in I} x_{if(i)}),$$\nwhere $K(i):=\\lbrace j\\in J\\mid (i,j)\\in K\\rbrace$, and\n$A=\\lbrace f:I\\to J\\mid f(i)\\in K(i)\\mbox{ for all }i\\in I\\rbrace$.\n\nBy setting $I=J=\\lbrace 1,2\\rbrace$ and\n$K=\\lbrace (1,1),(2,1),(2,2)\\rbrace$, then $K(1)=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$,\n$K(2)=\\lbrace 1,2\\rbrace$, and $A$ consists of two functions\n$\\lbrace (1,1), (2,1)\\rbrace$ and $\\lbrace (1,1),(2,2)\\rbrace$. Then,\nthe equation above reads:\n$$(x_{11}) \\wedge (x_{21} \\vee x_{22})= (x_{11}\\wedge x_{21}) \\vee (x_{11}\\wedge x_{22})$$\nwhich is one of the distributive laws, so that complete distributivity\nimplies distributivity.\n\nMore generally, setting $I=\\lbrace 1,2\\rbrace$ and $J$ containing $1$\nbut otherwise arbitrary, and\n$K=\\lbrace (2,j)\\mid j\\in J\\rbrace \\cup \\lbrace (1,1)\\rbrace$. Then\n$K(1)=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$, $K(2)=J$, and $A$ is the set of functions from\n$I$ to $J$ fixing $1$, and the equation (1) above now looks like\n$$x_{11} \\wedge (\\bigvee \\lbrace x_{2j}\\mid j\\in J\\rbrace = \\bigvee \\lbrace x_{11}\\wedge x_{2j} \\mid j\\in J\\rbrace$$\nwhich shows that completely distributivity implies **.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  Dualizing the above equation results in the same lattice. In other\n    words, a completely distributive lattice may be equivalently defined\n    using the dual of Equation (1). As a result, a completely\n    distributive lattice also satisfies MID, and hence is infinite\n    distributive.\n\n2.  However, a complete distributive lattice does not have to be\n    completely distributive. Here\u2019s an example: let $\\mathbb{N}$ be the\n    set of natural numbers with the usual ordering, and $\\mathbb{N}'$ be\n    an identical copy of $\\mathbb{N}$ such that each natural number $n$\n    corresponds to $n'\\in \\mathbb{N}'$. Then $\\mathbb{N}'$ has a natural\n    ordering induced by the usual ordering on $\\mathbb{N}$. Take the\n    union $N$ of these two sets. Then $N$ becomes a lattice if we extend\n    the meets and joins on $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{N}'$ by\n    additionally setting $$a'\\vee b:= \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    a' & \\textrm{if } b\\le a, \\\\\n    b' & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ and $$a' \\wedge b:= \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{ll}\n    b & \\textrm{if } b\\le a, \\\\\n    a & \\textrm{otherwise.}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.$$ Finally, let $L$ be the lattice formed from $N$ by\n    adjoining an extra element $\\infty$ to be its top element. It is not\n    hard to see that $L$ is complete and distributive. However, $L$ is\n    not completely distributive, for\n    $0' \\wedge (\\bigvee \\lbrace a\\mid a\\in \\mathbb{N}\\rbrace )=0' \\wedge \\infty =0'$,\n    whereas\n    $\\bigvee \\lbrace 0'\\wedge a \\mid a\\in \\mathbb{N} \\rbrace = \\bigvee \\lbrace 0\\rbrace = 0 \\ne 0'$.\n\n3.  In some literature, completeness assumption is not required, so that\n    the equation (1) above is conditionally defined. In other words, the\n    equation is defined only when each side of the equation exists\n    first.\n\n4.  Another generalization is the so-called\n    $(\\mathfrak{m},\\mathfrak{n})$-distributivity, where $\\mathfrak{m}$\n    and $\\mathfrak{n}$ are cardinal numbers. Specifically, a lattice $L$\n    is $(\\mathfrak{m},\\mathfrak{n})$-distributive if it is complete and\n    equation (1) is true whenever $I$ has cardinality $\\le \\mathfrak{m}$\n    and each $K(i)$ has cardinality $\\le \\mathfrak{n}$ for each\n    $i\\in I$.\n\n[8]{} G.
