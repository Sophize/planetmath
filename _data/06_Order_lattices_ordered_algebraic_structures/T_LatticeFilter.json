  "definition": "Let $L$ be a lattice. A *filter* (of $L$) is the dual concept of an .\nSpecifically, a filter $F$ of $L$ is a non-empty subset of $L$ such that\n\n1.  $F$ is a sublattice of $L$, and\n\n2.  for any $a\\in F$ and $b\\in L$, $a\\vee b\\in F$.\n\nThe first condition can be replaced by a weaker one: for any $a,b\\in F$,\n$a\\wedge b\\in F$.\n\nAn equivalent characterization of a filter $I$ in a lattice $L$ is\n\n1.  for any $a,b\\in F$, $a\\wedge b\\in F$, and\n\n2.  for any $a\\in F$, if $a\\le b$, then $b\\in F$.\n\nNote that the dualization switches the meet and join operations, as well\nas reversing the ordering relationship.\n\n**Special Filters**. Let $F$ be a filter of a lattice $L$. Some of the\ncommon types of filters are defined below.\n\n-   $F$ is a *proper filter* if $F\\ne L$, and, if $L$ contains $0$,\n    $F\\ne 0$.\n\n-   $F$ is a *prime filter* if it is proper, and $a\\vee b\\in F$ implies\n    that either $a\\in F$ or $b\\in F$.\n\n-   $F$ is an *ultrafilter* (or *maximal filter*) of $L$ if $F$ is\n    proper and the only filter properly contains $F$ is $L$.\n\n-   **filter generated by a set**. Let $X$ be a subset of a lattice $L$.\n    Let $T$ be the set of all filters of $L$ containing $X$. Since\n    $T\\ne\\varnothing$ ($L\\in T$), the intersection $N$ of all elements\n    in $T$, is also a filter of $L$ that contains $X$. $N$ is called the\n    *filter generated by* $X$, written $[X)$. If $X$ is a singleton\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$, then $N$ is said to be a *principal filter*\n    generated by $x$, written $[x)$.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  Consider the positive integers, with meet and join defined by the\n    greatest common divisor and the least common multiple operations.\n    Then the positive even numbers form a filter, generated by $2$. If\n    we toss in $3$ as an additional element, then\n    $1=2\\wedge 3\\in[\\lbrace 2,3\\rbrace)$ and consequently any positive\n    integer $i\\in[\\lbrace 2,3\\rbrace)$, since $1\\le i$. In general, if\n    $p,q$ are relatively prime, then\n    $[\\lbrace p,q\\rbrace)=\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. In fact, any proper filter in\n    $\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is principal. When the generator is prime, the\n    filter is prime, which is also maximal. So prime filters and\n    ultrafilters coincide in $\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.\n\n2.  Let $A$ be a set and $2^A$ the power set of $A$. If the set\n    inclusion is the ordering defined on $2^A$, then the definition of a\n    filter here coincides with the ususal definition of a on a set in\n    general.\n\n**Remark**. If $F$ is both a filter and an ideal of a lattice $L$, then\n$F=L$.",
