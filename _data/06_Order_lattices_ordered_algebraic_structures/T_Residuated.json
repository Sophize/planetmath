  "definition": "Let $P,Q$ be two posets. Recall that a function $f:P\\to Q$ is order\npreserving iff $x\\le y$ implies $f(x)\\le f(y)$. This is equivalent to\nsaying that the preimage of any down set under $f$ is a down set.\n\n**Definition** A function $f:P\\to Q$ between ordered sets $P,Q$ is said\nto be *residuated* if the preimage of any principal down set is a\nprincipal down set. In other words, for any $y\\in Q$, there is some\n$x\\in P$ such that\n$$f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}{y}) = {\\downarrow\\!\\!}{x},$$ where $f^{-1}(A)$\nfor any $A\\subseteq Q$ is the set $\\lbrace a\\in X\\mid f(a)\\in A\\rbrace$,\nand ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}b = \\lbrace c \\mid c\\le b\\rbrace$.\n\nLet us make some observations on a residuated function $f:P\\to Q$:\n\n1.  $f$ is order preserving.\n\n    Suppose $a\\le b$ in $P$. Then there is some $c\\in P$ such that\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}c = f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b))$. Since\n    $f(b) \\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b)$, $b \\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}c$, or\n    $b\\le c$, which means $a\\le c$, or $a\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}c$. But\n    this implies $a\\in f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b))$, so that\n    $f(a) \\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}f(b)$, or $f(a)\\le f(b)$.\n\n2.  The $x$ in the definition above is unique.\n\n    If ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x = {\\downarrow\\!\\!}z$, then\n    $x\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}z$, or $x\\le z$. Similarly, $z\\le x$, so that\n    $x=z$.\n\n3.  $g:Q\\to P$ given by $g(y)=x$ is a well-defined function, with the\n    following properties:\n\n    1.  $g$ is order preserving,\n\n    2.  $1_P \\le g\\circ f$,\n\n    3.  $f\\circ g\\le 1_Q$.\n\n    $g$ is order preserving: if $r\\le s$ in $Q$, then\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}r \\subseteq {\\downarrow\\!\\!}s$, so that\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}u = f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}r)\\subseteq f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}s) = {\\downarrow\\!\\!}v$,\n    where $u=g(r)$ and $v=g(s)$. But\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}u\\subseteq {\\downarrow\\!\\!}v$ implies $u\\le v$, or\n    $g(r)\\le g(s)$.\n\n    $1_P \\le g\\circ f$: let $x\\in P$, $y=f(x)$, and $z=g(y)$. Then\n    $x\\in f^{-1}(y) \\subseteq f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}y) = {\\downarrow\\!\\!}z$,\n    which implies $x\\le z=g(f(x))$ as desired.\n\n    $f\\circ g\\le 1_Q$: pick $y\\in Q$ and let $x=g(y)$. Then\n    $f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}y)={\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$, so that\n    $f(x)\\in f({\\downarrow\\!\\!}x) = f(f^{-1}( {\\downarrow\\!\\!}y))={\\downarrow\\!\\!}y$,\n    or $f(x)\\le y$, or $f(g(y))=f(x) \\le y$ as a result.\n\nActually, the third observation above characterizes $f$ being\nresiduated:\n\nIf $f$ is order preserving, and $g$ satisfies $3(a)$ through $3(c)$,\nthen $f$ is residuated. In fact, such a $g$ is unique.\n\nSuppose $y\\in Q$, and let $x=g(y)$. We want to show that\n${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x=f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}y)$. First, suppose\n$a \\in f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}y)$. Then $f(a) \\le y$, which means\n$g(f(a))\\le g(y)=x$. But then $a\\le g(f(a))$, and we get $a\\le x$, or\n$a\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$. Next, suppose $a\\le x=g(y)$. Then\n$f(a) \\le f(x) =f(g(y))\\le y$, so\n$a\\in f^{-1}(f(a))\\subseteq f^{-1}({\\downarrow\\!\\!}y)$.\n\nTo see uniqueness, suppose $h:Q\\to P$ is order preserving such that\n$1_P \\le h\\circ f$ and $f\\circ h\\le 1_Q$. Then\n$g = 1_P \\circ g \\le (h \\circ f )\\circ g = h \\circ (f\\circ g) \\le = h\\circ 1_Q = h$\nand\n$h = 1_P \\circ h \\le (g\\circ f) \\circ h = g \\circ (f \\circ h) \\le g \\circ 1_Q = g$.\n\n**Definition**. Given a residuated function $f:P\\to Q$, the unique\nfunction $g:Q\\to P$ defined above is called the *residual* of $f$, and\nis denoted by $f^+$.\n\nFor example, given any function $f: A\\to B$, the induced function\n$f: P(A)\\to P(B)$ (by abuse of notation, we use the same notation as\noriginal function $f$), given by $f(S)=\\lbrace f(a)\\mid a\\in S\\rbrace$\nis residuated. Its residual is the function $f^{-1}: P(B)\\to P(A)$,\ngiven by $f^{-1}(T)=\\lbrace a \\in A\\mid f(a)\\in T\\rbrace$.\n\nHere are some properties of residuated functions and their residuals:\n\n-   A bijective residuated function is an order isomorphism, and\n    conversely. Furthermore, the residual is residuated, and is its\n    inverse.\n\n-   If $f: P\\to Q$ is residuated, then $f\\circ f^+ \\circ f = f$ and\n    $f^+ \\circ f \\circ f^+ = f^+$.\n\n-   If $f: P\\to Q$ and $g:Q\\to R$ are residuated, so is $g\\circ f$ and\n    $(g\\circ f)^+=f^+\\circ g^+$.\n\n-   If $f: P\\to Q$ is residuated, then $f^+\\circ f: P \\to P$ is a\n    closure map on $P$. Conversely, any closure function can be\n    decomposed as the functional composition of a residuated function\n    and its residual.\n\n**Remark**. Residuated functions and their residuals are closely related\nto Galois connections. If $f:P\\to Q$ is residuated, then $(f,f^+)$ forms\na Galois connection between $P$ and $Q$. On the other hand, if $(f,g)$\nis a Galois connection between $P$ and $Q$, then $f: P\\to Q$ is\nresiduated, and $g: Q\\to P$ is $f^+$. Note that PM defines a Galois\nconnection as a pair of order-preserving maps, where as in Blyth, they\nare order reversing.\n\n[6]{} T.S.
