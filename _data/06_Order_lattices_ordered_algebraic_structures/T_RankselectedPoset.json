  "definition": "Let $P$ be a graded poset of rank $n+1$ with rank function $\\rho$. For\nany $S\\subset\\{0,1,\\dots,n+1\\}$ let $P_S$ denote the subset\n$$P_S = \\{ x \\in P \\colon \\rho(x) \\in S \\} = \\rho^{-1}(S).$$ Each such\nsubset inherits a poset structure from $P$ as an induced poset. So we\ncall $P_S$ the [*rank-selected poset*]{} of $P$ induced by $S$, or more\nbriefly the $S$-rank-selected subposet of $P$.\n\nThe rank-selected posets of a poset $P$ can be used to define two\nspecial arithmetic invariants of $P$. First for each $S$, the [*alpha\ninvariant*]{} $\\alpha_S(P)$ is the number of saturated chains in $P_S$.\nThen define $\\beta_S(P)$ by\n$$\\beta_S(P) = \\sum_{T\\subset S}(-1)^{|S| - |T|}\\alpha_T(P).$$ The\ninvariant $\\beta$ is called the [*rank-selected M\u00f6bius invariant*]{} of\n$P$.\n\nFor example, let $L$ be the face poset of a convex polytope $P$ of\ndimension $n$, including the special elements $\\widehat{0}$\n(representing the empty face) and $\\widehat{1}$ (representing the\ninterior of the polytope). For any $i\\in\\{0,\\dots,n-1\\}$, the alpha\ninvariant $\\alpha_{\\{i+1\\}}(L)$ counts the number of faces of $P$ of\ndimension $i$. For arbitrary $S\\subset\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, the numbers\n$\\alpha_S(L)$ are entries in the flag $f$-vector of $P$ and thus count\nflags of faces in $P$, while the $\\beta_S(L)$ are entries in the flag\n$h$-vector of $P$.\n\nWhile the alpha invariant is by construction always nonnegative, the\nM\u00f6bius invariant is not guaranteed to be nonnegative. Posets for which\nthe M\u00f6bius invariant is always nonnegative (and therefore counts\nsomething) are of special interest to combinatorialists. In particular,\nthe M\u00f6bius invariant is nonnegative for face posets of convex polytopes.\n\n[9]{} Stanley, R., *Enumerative Combinatorics*, vol. 1, 2nd ed.,\nCambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996.",
