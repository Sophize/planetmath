  "definition": "We begin this article with something more general. Let $P$ be a poset. A\nsubset $A\\subseteq P$ is said to be *convex* if for any $a,b\\in A$ with\n$a\\le b$, the poset interval $[a,b]\\subseteq A$ also. In other words,\n$c\\in A$ for any $c\\in P$ such that $a\\le c$ and $c\\le b$. Examples of\nconvex subsets are intervals themselves, antichains, whose intervals are\nsingletons, and the empty set.\n\nOne encounters convex sets most often in the study of partially ordered\ngroups. A *convex subgroup* $H$ of a po-group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$\nthat is a convex subset of the poset $G$ at the same time. Since\n$e\\in H$, we have that $[e,a]\\subseteq H$ for any $e\\le a\\in H$.\nConversely, if a subgroup $H$ satisfies the property that\n$[e,a]\\subseteq H$ whenever $a\\in H$, then $H$ is a convex subgroup: if\n$a,b\\in H$, then $a^{-1}b\\in H$, so that $[e,a^{-1}b]\\subseteq H$, which\nimplies that $[a,b]=a[e,a^{-1}b]\\subseteq H$ as well.\n\nFor example, let $G=\\mathbb{R}^2$ be the po-group under the usual\nCartesian ordering. $G$ and $0$ are both convex, but these are trivial\nexamples. Let us see what other convex subgroups $H$ there are. Suppose\n$P=(a,b)\\in H$ with $(a,b)\\ne (0,0)=O$. We divide this into several\ncases:\n\n1.  $ab>0$. If $a>0$, then $b>0$ ($P$ in the first quadrant), so that\n    $O\\le P$, which means $[O,P]\\subseteq H$. If $a<0$, then $b<0$ ($P$\n    in the third quandrant), so that $O\\le -P$. In either case, $H$\n    contains a rectangle ($[O,P]$ or $[O,-P]$) that generates $G$, so\n    $H=G$.\n\n2.  One of $a$ or $b$ is $0$. Suppose $a=0$ for now. Then either $0<b$\n    so that $[O,P]\\subseteq H$ or $b<0$ so that $[O,-P]\\subseteq H$. In\n    either case, $H$ contains a line segment on the $y$-axis. But this\n    line segment generates the $y$-axis. So $y$-axis $\\subseteq H$. If\n    $H$ is a subgroup of the $y$-axis, then $H$=$y$-axis.\n\n    Otherwise, another point $Q=(c,d)\\in H$ not on the $y$-axis. We have\n    the following subcases:\n\n    1.  If $cd>0$, then $H=G$ as in the previous case.\n\n    2.  If $cd< 0$, say $d<0$ (or $0<c$), then for some positive integer\n        $n$, $0<d+nb$, so that $O\\le Q+nP$, and $H=G$ as well. On the\n        other hand, if $c<0$ (or $0<d$), then $-Q$ returns us to the\n        previous argument and $H=G$ again.\n\n    3.  If $d=0$ (so $c\\ne 0$), then either $O\\le P+Q$ (when $0<c$) or\n        $O\\le P-Q$ (when $c<0$), so that $H=G$ once more.\n\n    A similar set of arguments shows that if $H$ contains a segment of\n    the $x$-axis, then either $H$ is the $x$-axis or $H=G$. In\n    conclusion, in the case when $ab=0$, $H$ is either one of the two\n    axes, or the entire group.\n\n3.  $ab<0$. It is enough to assume that $0<a$ and $b<0$ (that $P$ lies\n    in the fourth quadrant), for if $P$ lies in the second quadrant,\n    $-P$ lies in the fourth.\n\n    Since $O,P\\in H$, $H$ could be a subgroup of the line group $L$\n    containing $O$ and $P$. No two points on $L$ are comparable, for if\n    $(r,s)<(t,u)$ on $L$, then the slope of $L$ is positive\n    $$0<\\frac{u-s}{t-r},$$ a contradiction. So $L$, and hence $H$, is an\n    antichaine. This means that $H$ is convex.\n\n    Suppose now $H$ contains a point $Q=(c,d)$ not on $L$. We again\n    break this down into subcases:\n\n    1.  $Q$ is in the first or third quandrant. Then $H=G$ as in the\n        very first case above.\n\n    2.  $Q$ is on either of the axes. Then $H=G$ also, as in case 2(b)\n        above.\n\n    3.  $Q$ is in the second or fourth quadrant. It is enough to assume\n        that $Q$ is in the same quadrant as $P$ (fourth). So we have\n        $0<c$ and $d<0$. Since $L$ passes through $P$ and not $Q$, we\n        have that $$\\frac{a}{c}\\ne \\frac{b}{d}.$$ Let $0<r=a/c$ and\n        $0<s=b/d$ and assume $r<s$. Then there is a rational number\n        $m/n$ (with $0<m,n$) such that $$r<\\frac{m}{n}<s.$$ This means\n        that $na< mc$ and $nb<md$, or $nP<mQ$. But $nP,mQ\\in H$, so is\n        $R=mQ-nP\\in H$, which is in the first quadrant. This implies\n        that $H=G$ too.\n\n    In summary, if $H$ contains a point in the second or fourth\n    quadrant, then either $H$ is a subgroup of a line with slope $<0$,\n    or $H=G$.\n\nThe three main cases above exhaust all convex subgroups of\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ under the Cartesian ordering.\n\nIf the Euclidean plane is equipped with the lexicographic ordering, then\nthe story is quite different, but simpler. If $H$ is non-trivial, say\n$P=(a,b)\\in H$, $P\\ne O$. If $0<a$, then $(c,d)\\le (a,b)$ for any $c< a$\nregardless of $d$. Choose $Q=(c,d)$ to be in the first quadrant. Then\n$[O,Q]\\subseteq H$, so that $H=G$. If $a<0$, then $-P$ takes us back to\nthe previous argument. If $a=0$, then either $[O,P]$ (when $0<b$), or\n$[O,-P]$ (when $b<0$) is a positive interval on the $y$-axis. This\nimplies that $H$ is at least the $y$-axis. If $H$ contains no other\npoints, then $H=y$-axis. In summary, the po-group $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with\nlexicographic order has the $y$-axis as the only non-trivial proper\nconvex subgroup.\n\n[8]{} G.
