  "statement": "If $P$ is a poset with width $w<\\infty$, then $w$ is also the smallest\ninteger such that $P$ can be written as the union of $w$ chains.\n\n**Remark**. The smallest cardinal $c$ such that $P$ can be written as\nthe union of $c$ chains is called the *chain covering number* of $P$. So\nDilworth\u2019s theorem says that if the width of $P$ is finite, then it is\nequal to the chain covering number of $P$. If $w$ is infinite, then\nstatement is not true. The proof of Dilworth\u2019s theorem and its\ncounterexample in the infinite case can be found in the reference below.\n\n[6]{} J.B. Nation, \u201cLattice Theory\",",
