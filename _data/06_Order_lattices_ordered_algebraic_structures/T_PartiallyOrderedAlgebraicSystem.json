  "definition": "Let $A$ be a poset. Recall a function $f$ on $A$ is said to be\n\n-   order-preserving (or isotone) provided that $f(a)\\le f(b)$, or\n\n-   order-reversing (or antitone) provided that $f(a)\\ge f(b)$, or\n\nwhenever $a\\le b$. Furthermore, $f$ is called monotone if $f$ is either\nisotone or antitone.\n\nFor every function $f$ on $A$, we denote it to be $\\uparrow$,\n$\\downarrow$, or $\\updownarrow$ according to whether it is isotone,\nantitone, or both. The following are some easy consequences:\n\n-   $\\uparrow \\circ \\downarrow = \\downarrow \\circ \\uparrow = \\downarrow$\n    (meaning that the composition of an isotone and an antitone maps is\n    antitone),\n\n-   $\\uparrow \\circ \\uparrow = \\downarrow \\circ \\downarrow = \\uparrow$\n    (meaning that the composition of two isotone or two antitone maps is\n    isotone),\n\n-   $f$ is $\\updownarrow$ iff it is a constant on any chain in $A$, and\n    if this is the case, for every $a\\in A$, $f^{-1}(a)$ is a maximal\n    chain in $A$.\n\nThe notion above can be generalized to $n$-ary operations on a poset\n$A$. An $n$-ary operation $f$ on a poset $A$ is said to be *isotone*,\n*antitone*, or *monotone* iff when $f$ is isotone, antitone, or monotone\nwith respect to each of its $n$ variables. We continue to use to arrow\nnotations above to denote $n$-ary monotone functions. For example, a\nternary function that is $(\\uparrow,\\downarrow,\\uparrow)$ is isotone\nwith respect to its first and third variables, and antitone with respect\nto its second variable.\n\n**Definition**. A *partially ordered algebraic system* is an algebraic\nsystem $\\mathcal{A}=(A,O)$ such that $A$ is a poset, and every operation\n$f \\in O$ on $A$ is monotone. A partially ordered algebraic system is\nalso called a partially ordered algebra, or a po-algebra for short.\n\nExamples of po-algebras are po-groups, po-rings, and po-semigroups. In\nall three cases, the multiplication operations are\n$(\\uparrow,\\uparrow)$, as well as the addition operation in a po-ring..\nIn the case of a po-group, the multiplicative inverse operation is\n$\\downarrow$, as well as the additive inverse operation in a po-ring.\n\nAnother example is an ordered vector space $V$ over a field $k$. The\nunderlying universe is $V$ (not $k$). Addition over $V$ is, like the\nother examples above, isotone. Each element $r\\in k$ acts as a unary\noperator on $V$, given by $r(v)=rv$, the scalar multiplication of $r$\nand $v$. As $k$ is itself a poset, it can be partitioned into three\nsets: the positive cone $P(k)$ of $k$, the negative cone $-P(k)$, and\n$\\lbrace 0\\rbrace$. Then $r\\in P(k)$ iff it is $\\uparrow$ as a unary\noperator, $r\\in -P(k)$ iff it is $\\downarrow$, and $r=0$ iff it is\n$\\updownarrow$.\n\n**Remarks**\n\n-   A homomorphism from one po-algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ to another\n    $\\mathcal{B}$ is an isotone map $\\phi$ from posets $A$ to $B$ that\n    is at the same time a homomorphism from the algebraic systems\n    $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n-   A partially ordered subalgebra of a po-algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ is just\n    a subalgebra of $\\mathcal{A}$ viewed as an algebra, where the\n    partial ordering on the universe of the subalgebra is inherited from\n    the partial ordering on $A$.\n\n[9]{} L.
