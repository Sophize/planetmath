  "definition": "The *law of trichotomy* for a binary relation $R$ on a set $S$ is the\nproperty that\n\n-   for all $x,y\\in S$, exactly one of the following holds: $xRy$ or\n    $yRx$ or $x=y$.\n\nA binary relation satisfying the law of trichotomy is sometimes said to\nbe *trichotomous*. Trichotomous binary relations are equivalent to\ntournaments, although the study of tournaments is usually restricted to\nthe finite case.\n\nA transitive trichotomous binary relation is called a total order, and\nis typically written $<$.\n\nThe law of trichotomy for cardinal numbers is equivalent (in ZF) to the\n.",
