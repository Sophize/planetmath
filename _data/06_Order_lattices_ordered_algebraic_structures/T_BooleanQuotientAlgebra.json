  "definition": "### Quotient Algebras via Congruences {#quotient-algebras-via-congruences .unnumbered}\n\nLet $A$ be a Boolean algebra. A congruence on $A$ is an equivalence\nrelation $Q$ on $A$ such that $Q$ respects the Boolean operations:\n\n-   if $a Q b$ and $c Q d$, then $(a\\vee c) Q (b\\vee d)$\n\n-   if $a Q b$, then $a' Q b'$\n\nBy de Morgan\u2019s laws, we also have $a Q b$ and $c Q d$ implying\n$(a\\wedge c) Q (b\\wedge d)$.\n\nWhen $a$ is congruent to $b$, we usually write $a\\equiv b\\pmod{Q}$.\n\nLet $B$ be the set of congruence classes: $B=A/Q$, and write $[a]Q$, or\nsimply $[a]$ for the congruence class containing the element $a\\in A$.\nDefine on $B$ the following operations:\n\n-   $[a]\\vee [b]:= [a\\vee b]$\n\n-   $[a]':=[a']$\n\nBecause $Q$ respects join and complementation, it is clear that these\nare well-defined operations on $B$. Furthermore, we may define\n$[a]\\wedge [b]:=([a]'\\vee [b]')'=([a']\\vee [b'])'=[a'\\vee b']'=[(a'\\vee b')']=[a\\wedge b]$.\nIt is also easy to see that $[1]$ and $[0]$ are the top and bottom\nelements of $B$. Finally, it is straightforward to verify that $B$ is a\nBoolean algebra. The algebra $B$ is called the *Boolean quotient\nalgebra* of $A$ via the congruence $Q$.\n\n### Quotient Algebras via Ideals and Filters {#quotient-algebras-via-ideals-and-filters .unnumbered}\n\nIt is also possible to define quotient algebras via Boolean ideals and\nBoolean filters. Let $A$ be a Boolean algebra and $I$ an ideal of $A$.\nDefine binary relation $\\sim$ on $A$ as follows:\n$$a\\sim b\\qquad \\mbox{if and only if} \\qquad a\\Delta b\\in I,$$ where\n$\\Delta$ is the symmetric difference operator on $A$. Then\n\n1.  $\\sim$ is an equivalence on $A$, because\n\n    -   $a\\Delta a=0\\in I$, so $\\sim$ is reflexive\n\n    -   $b\\Delta a=a\\Delta b$, so $\\sim$ is symmetric, and\n\n    -   if $a\\sim b$ and $b\\sim c$, then $a\\sim c$; to see this, note\n        that\n        $(a-b)\\vee (b-c)=((a-b)\\vee b)\\wedge ((a-b)\\vee c')=(a\\vee b)\\wedge ((a-b)\\vee c')$.\n        Since the LHS (and hence the RHS) is in $I$, and that\n        $a\\le a\\vee b$ and $c'\\le (a-b)\\vee c'$, RHS\n        $\\ge a\\wedge c'=a-c\\in I$ too. Similarly $c-a\\in I$ so that\n        $a\\sim c$.\n\n2.  $\\sim$ respects $\\vee$ and $'$, because\n\n    -   if $a\\sim b$ and $c\\sim d$, then\n        $(a\\vee c)-(b\\vee d)=(a\\vee c)\\wedge (b\\vee d)'=(a\\vee c)\\wedge (b'\\wedge d') = (a\\wedge (b'\\wedge d'))\\vee (c\\wedge (b'\\wedge d'))\\le (a\\wedge b')\\vee (c\\wedge d')\\in I$,\n        so that $(a\\vee c)-(b\\vee d)\\in I$ as well. That\n        $(b\\vee d)-(a\\vee c)\\in I$ is proved similarly. Hence\n        $(a\\vee c)\\sim (b\\vee d)$.\n\n    -   $a'\\Delta b'=a\\Delta b$, so $\\sim$ preserves $'$.\n\nThus, $\\sim$ is a congruence on $A$. The quotient algebra $A/\\sim$ is\ncalled the *quotient algebra* of $A$ via the ideal $I$, and is often\ndenoted by $A/I$.\n\nFrom this congruence $\\sim$, one can re-capture the ideal: $I=[0]$.\n\nDually, one can obtain a quotient algebra from a Boolean filter.\nSpecifically, if $F$ is a filter of a Boolean algebra $A$, define $\\sim$\non $A$ as follows:\n$$a\\sim b\\qquad \\mbox{if and only if} \\qquad a\\leftrightarrow b\\in F,$$\nwhere $\\leftrightarrow$ is the biconditional operator on $A$. Then it is\neasy to show that $\\sim$ too is a congruence on $A$, so that one forms\nthe *quotient algebra* of $A$ via the filter $F$, denoted by $A/F$. Of\ncourse, an easier approach to this is to realize that $F$ is a filter of\n$A$ iff $F':=\\lbrace a'\\mid a\\in F\\rbrace$ is an ideal of $A$, and the\nprocess of forming $A/F'$ turns out to be identical to $A/F$.\n\nFrom $\\sim$, the filter $F$ can be recovered: $F=[1]$.\n\nIn fact, given a congruence $Q$, the congruence class $[0]Q$ is a\nBoolean ideal and the congruence class $[1]Q$ is a Boolean filter, and\nthat the quotient algebras derived from $Q,[0]Q$ and $[1]Q$ are all the\nsame: $$A/Q=A/[0]Q=A/[1]Q.$$",
