  "definition": "Recall that a Boolean algebra is an algebraic system $A$ consisting of\nfive operations:\n\n1.  two binary operations: the meet $\\wedge$ and the join $\\vee$,\n\n2.  one unary operation: the complementation $'$, and\n\n3.  two nullary operations (constants): $0$ and $1$.\n\nFrom these operations, define the following \u201cderived\u201d operations (on\n$A$): for $a,b\\in A$\n\n1.  (subtraction) $a-b:=a\\wedge b'$,\n\n2.  (symmetric difference or addition) $a\\Delta b$ (or\n    $a+b$)$:=(a-b)\\vee (b-a)$,\n\n3.  (conditional) $a\\to b:=(a-b)'$,\n\n4.  (biconditional) $a\\leftrightarrow b:=(a\\to b)\\wedge (b\\to a)$, and\n\n5.  (Sheffer stroke) $a|b:=a'\\wedge b'$.\n\nNotice that the operators $\\to$ and $\\leftrightarrow$ are dual of $-$\nand $\\Delta$ respectively.\n\nIt is evident that these derived operations (and indeed the entire\ntheory of Boolean algebras) owe their existence to those operations and\nconnectives that are found in logic and set theory, as the following\ntable illustrates:\n\n     symbol $\\backslash$ operation           Boolean                 Logic               Set\n  ----------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------- ----------------\n           $\\vee$ or $\\cup$                    join               logical or            union\n          $\\wedge$ or $\\cap$                   meet               logical and        intersection\n   $'$ or $\\neg$ or $^{\\complement}$        complement            logical not         complement\n                  $0$                     bottom element            falsity           empty set\n                  $1$                      top element               truth             universe\n          $-$ or $\\setminus$               subtraction                              set difference\n            $\\Delta$ or $+$            symmetric difference                        \n                 $\\to$                     conditional            implication      \n           $\\leftrightarrow$              biconditional       logical equivalence  \n                  $|$                     Sheffer stroke        Sheffer stroke     \n\nSome of the elementary properties of these derived Boolean operators\nare:\n\n1.  $a-0=a$ and $a-a=0-a=a-1=0$,\n\n2.  $(A,+,\\wedge,0,1)$ is a ring (a Boolean ring),\n\n3.  all Boolean operations can be defined in terms of the Sheffer stroke\n    $|$.\n\nThe proofs of these properties mimic the proofs for the properties of\nthe corresponding operators found in naive set theory and propositional\nlogic, such as .",
