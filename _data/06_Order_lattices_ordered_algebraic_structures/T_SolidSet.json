  "definition": "Let $V$ be a vector lattice and $|\\cdot|$ be the absolute value defined\non $V$. A subset $A\\subseteq V$ is said to be *solid*, or *absolutely\nconvex*, if, $|v|\\le |u|$ implies that $v\\in A$, whenever $u\\in A$ in\nthe first place.\n\nFrom this definition, one deduces immediately that $0$ belongs to every\nnon-empty solid set. Also, if $a$ is in a solid set, so is $a^+$, since\n$|a^+|=a^+\\le a^++a^-=|a|$. Similarly $a^-\\in S$, and $|a|\\in S$, as\n$||a||=|a|$. Furthermore, we have\n\nIf $S$ is a solid subspace of $V$, then $S$ is a vector sublattice.\n\nSuppose $a,b\\in S$. We want to show that $a\\wedge b\\in S$, from which we\nsee that $a\\vee b= a+b-(a\\wedge b)\\in S$ also since $S$ is a vector\nsubspace. Since both $a\\wedge b, a\\vee b\\in S$, we have that $S$ is a\nsublattice.\n\nTo show that $a\\wedge b\\in S$, we need to find $c\\in S$ with\n$|a\\wedge b|\\le |c|$. Let $c=|a|+|b|$. Since $a,b\\in S$, $|a|,|b|\\in S$,\nand so $c\\in S$ as well. We also have that $|c|=c$. So to show\n$a\\wedge b\\in S$, it is enough to show that $|a\\wedge b|\\le c$. To this\nend, note first that $a\\le |a|$ and $b\\le |b|$, so\n$a\\wedge b\\le |a|\\wedge |b|\\le |a|\\vee |b|$. Also, since $-a\\le |a|$ and\n$-b\\le |b|$, $-(a\\wedge b)=(-a)\\vee (-b)\\le |a|\\vee |b|$. As a result,\n$|a\\wedge b|=-(a\\wedge b)\\vee (a\\wedge b)\\le |a|\\vee |b|$. But\n$|a|\\vee |b|\\le |a|\\vee |b|+|a|\\wedge |b|=|a|+|b|=c$, we have that\n$|a\\wedge b|\\le |a|\\vee |b| \\le c$.\n\n**Examples** Let $V$ be a vector lattice.\n\n-   $0$ and $V$ itself are solid subspaces.\n\n-   If $V$ is finite dimensional, the only solid subspaces are the\n    improper ones.\n\n-   An example of a proper solid subspace of a vector lattice is found,\n    when we take $V$ to be the countably infinite direct product of\n    $\\mathbb{R}$, and $S$ to be the countably infinite direct sum of\n    $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n-   An example of a solid set that is not a subspace is the unit disk in\n    $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where the ordering is defined componentwise.\n\n-   Given any set $A$, the smallest solid set containing $A$ is called\n    the *solid closure* of $A$. For example, if $A=\\lbrace a\\rbrace$,\n    then its solid closure is $\\lbrace v\\in V\\mid |v|\\le |a|\\rbrace$. In\n    $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the solid closure of any point $p$ is the disk\n    centered at $O$ whose radius is $|p|$.\n\n-   The solid closure of $V^+$, the positive cone, is $V$.\n\nIf $V$ is a vector lattice and $S$ is a solid subspace of $V$, then\n$V/S$ is a vector lattice.\n\nSince $S$ is a subspace $V/S$ has the structure of a vector space, whose\nvector space operations are inherited from the operations on $V$. Since\n$S$ is solid, it is a sublattice, so that $V/S$ has the structure of a\nlattice, whose lattice operations are inherited from those on $V$. It\nremains to show that the partial ordering is \u201ccompatible\u201d with the\nvector operatons. We break this down into two steps:\n\n-   for any $u+S,v+S,w+S \\in V/S$, if $(u+S)\\le (v+S)$, then\n    $(u+S)+(w+S)\\le (v+S)+(w+S)$. This is a disguised form of the\n    following: if $u-v\\le a\\in S$, then $(u+w)-(v+w)\\le b\\in S$ for some\n    $b$. This is obvious: just pick $b=a$.\n\n-   if $0+S\\le u+S\\in V/S$, then for any $0<\\lambda \\in k$ ($k$ an\n    ordered field), $0+S\\le \\lambda (u+S)$. This is the same as saying:\n    if $c\\le u$ for some $b\\in S$, then $d\\le \\lambda u$ for some\n    $d\\in S$. This is also obvious: pick $d=\\lambda c$.\n\nThe proof is now complete.",
