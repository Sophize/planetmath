  "statement": "In this entry, we present the proof of a fundamental fact that every\ndistributive lattice is lattice isomorphic to a ring of sets, originally\nproved by Birkhoff and Stone in the 1930\u2019s. The proof uses the . First,\na simple results from the prime ideal theorem:\n\nLet $L$ be a distributive lattice and $a,b\\in L$ with $a\\ne b$. Then\nthere is a prime ideal containing one or the other.\n\nLet $I=\\langle a\\rangle$ and $J=\\langle b\\rangle$, the principal ideals\ngenerated by $a,b$ respectively. If $I=J$, then $b\\le a$ and $a\\le b$,\nor $a=b$, contradicting the assumption. So $I\\ne J$, which means either\n$a\\notin J$ or $b\\notin I$. In either case, apply the prime ideal\ntheorem to obtain a prime ideal containing $I$ (or $J$) not containing\n$b$ (or $a$).\n\nBefore proving the theorem, we have one more concept to introduce:\n\n**Definition**. Let $L$ be a distributive lattice, and $X$ the set of\nall prime ideals of $L$. Define $F: L\\to P(X)$, the powerset of $X$, by\n$$F(a):=\\lbrace P\\mid a\\notin P\\rbrace.$$\n\n$F$ is an injection.\n\nIf $a\\ne b$, then by the lemma there is a prime ideal $P$ containing one\nbut not another, say $a\\in P$ and $b\\notin P$. Then $P\\notin F(a)$ and\n$P\\in F(b)$, so that $F(a)\\ne F(b)$.\n\n$F$ is a lattice homomorphism.\n\nThere are two things to show:\n\n-   $F$ preserves $\\wedge$: If $P\\in F(a\\wedge b)$, then\n    $a\\wedge b\\notin P$, so that $a\\notin P$ and $b\\notin P$, since $P$\n    is a sublattice. So $P\\in F(a)$ and $P\\in F(b)$ as a result. On the\n    other hand, if $P\\in F(a)\\cap F(b)$, then $a\\notin P$ and\n    $b\\notin P$. Since $P$ is prime, $a\\wedge b\\notin P$, so that\n    $P\\in F(a\\wedge b)$. Therefore, $F(a\\wedge b)=F(a)\\cap F(b)$.\n\n-   $F$ preserves $\\vee$: If $P\\in F(a\\vee b)$, then $a\\vee b\\notin P$,\n    which implies that $a\\notin P$ or $b\\notin P$, since $P$ is a\n    sublattice of $L$. So $P\\in F(a)\\cup F(b)$. On the other hand, if\n    $P\\in F(a)\\cup F(b)$, then $a\\vee b\\notin P$, since $P$ is a lattice\n    ideal. Hence $F(a\\vee b)=F(a)\\cup F(b)$.\n\nTherefore, $F$ is a lattice homomorphism.\n\nThe function $F$ is called the *canonical embedding* of $L$ into $P(X)$.\n\nEvery distributive lattice is isomorphic to a ring of sets.\n\nLet $L,X,F$ be as above. Since $F:L \\to P(X)$ is an embedding, $L$ is\nlattice isomorphic to $F(L)$, which is a ring of sets.\n\n**Remark**. Using the result above, one can show that if $L$ is a\nBoolean algebra, then $L$ is isomorphic to a field of sets. See link\nbelow for more detail.",
