  "definition": "Topology, in its most abstract sense, is the study of a family of\nsubsets, called open sets, of some given set $X$, when subject to\ncertain conditions based purely on set-theoretic operations. Namely,\nthese conditions are that the intersection of two open sets is an open\nset, union of open sets is an open set, and that the empty set and $X$\nare themselves open sets. One can thus think of a topology as a certain\nkind of a lattice $L(X)$ of subsets associated with the set $X$, and the\nstudy of a general topological space can be distilled further, to the\nstudy of this particular lattice $L(X)$. In this setting, the basic\nelements under scrutiny are no longer \u201cpoints\u201d in $X$, but elements of\n$L(X)$. This shift in focus is the starting point of the so-called\n\u201cpointless topology\u201d, where the study of topology takes on a\nlattice-theoretic flavor.\n\nSpecifically, the lattice $L(X)$ is an example of what is known as a\nlocale. Formally, a *locale* is a complete lattice $L$ that is meet\ninfinitely distributive: $$x\\wedge (\\bigvee Y)=\\bigvee (x\\wedge Y)$$ for\nany $Y\\subseteq L$, where\n$x\\wedge Y:=\\lbrace x\\wedge y\\mid y\\in Y\\rbrace$.\n\n. To see that the lattice $L(X)$ of open sets of a topological space $X$\nis a locale, we first observe that $L(X)$ is a complete lattice, since\narbitrary joins of open sets are open by definition, which is enough to\nensure that arbitrary meets exist too (although they are not arbitrary\nintersections, they are interiors of the intersections). This means that\n$\\bigvee Y$ and $\\bigvee (x\\bigwedge Y)$ are both open sets, and hence\nthe expressions in the equality are at least meaningful at this point.\nFurther,\n$\\bigvee (x\\wedge Y)=\\bigcup (x\\cap Y)\\subseteq x\\cap (\\bigcup Y)=x\\wedge (\\bigvee Y)$,\nbecause $x\\cap y\\subseteq x\\cap (\\bigcup Y)$ for individual $y\\in Y$. So\nwe are left with showing that\n$x\\wedge (\\bigvee Y)\\subseteq \\bigvee (x\\wedge Y)$. Again, this is true\nat an individual level: $$\\begin{aligned}\nx\\cap y\\subseteq \\bigcup (x\\cap Y).\\end{aligned}$$ Let\u2019s write\n$z=\\bigcup (x\\cap Y)$. Then the expression above becomes\n$y\\cap x\\subseteq z$, where $x,y,z$ are all open sets. Put it another\nway, $$\\begin{aligned}\ny &=&(y\\cap x)\\cup (y-x) \\\\ \n&\\subseteq& z\\cup (y-x) \\\\\n&=& z\\cup (y\\cap x^c) \\\\\n&=& (z\\cup y)\\cap (z\\cup x^c) \\\\\n&\\subseteq& (z\\cup y)\\cap (z\\cup x^c)^{\\circ}, \\end{aligned}$$ where $-$\ndenotes the set difference operator, $^c$ is the set complementation,\nand $^\\circ$ the interior operator. (6) comes from the fact that $y$ is\nopen. Now, take the union of all $y\\in Y$, and write this union\n$t:=\\bigcup Y=\\bigcup \\lbrace y\\mid y\\in Y\\rbrace$. Then\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nt &\\subseteq& (z\\cup t)\\cap (z\\cup x^c)^{\\circ} \\\\\n&\\subseteq& (z\\cup t)\\cap (z\\cup x^c) \\\\\n&=& z\\cup (t\\cap x^c).\\end{aligned}$$ Taking the intersection with $x$\non both sides, we have $$\\begin{aligned}\nt\\cap x &\\subseteq& (z\\cup (t\\cap x^c))\\cap x \\\\\n&=& (z\\cap x)\\cup ((t-x)\\cap x) \\\\\n&=& (z\\cap x)\\cup \\varnothing \\\\\n&=& z\\cap x \\\\\n&\\subseteq& z.\\end{aligned}$$ Substituting $t$ and $z$ back to their\noriginal form, we have $x\\cap (\\bigcup Y)\\subseteq \\bigcup (x\\cap Y)$,\nwhich is what we wanted to prove.\n\nNotice that in the proof above, no points of $X$ are employed, and\neverything is done via basic set operations, as well as extra set\noperations, such as the interior operator.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Another thing worthy of note is the following fact:\n\n    > A lattice is a locale iff it is a complete Brouwerian lattice\n    > (equivalently a complete Heyting algebra).\n\n    A sketch of proof goes as follows: if $L$ is a locale, then for any\n    $a,b\\in L$, the element\n    $\\bigvee \\lbrace c\\mid a\\wedge c\\le b\\rbrace$ is the relative\n    pseudocomplement of $a$ in $b$. Conversely, if $L$ is a Heyting\n    algebra, then we can use the trick that for every $y\\in Y$,\n    $y\\le x\\to \\bigvee (x\\wedge Y)$, to show\n    $x\\wedge (\\bigvee Y)\\le \\bigvee (x\\wedge Y)$.\n\n-   Other examples of locales found in topology is the lattice of\n    regular open sets in a topological space $X$.\n\n-   Complete Boolean algebras also provide examples of locales. But a\n    locale need not be complete Boolean. The interval topology on the\n    real line is such an example.\n\n-   A *locale homomorphism* $\\phi$ is a lattice homomorphism between two\n    locales such that arbitrary sups are preserved:\n    $\\phi(\\bigvee_{i\\in I} \\lbrace a_i\\rbrace) = \\bigvee_{i\\in I} \\lbrace \\phi(a_i)\\rbrace$.\n\n-   A locale is also called a *frame*, and a frame homomorphism a locale\n    homomorphism. However, P. T. Johnstone distinguishes the two names\n    when they are considered as categories. The category **Fra** of\n    frames consists of locales (or frames) as objects, and locale\n    homomorphisms as morphisms. On the other hand, the category **Loc**\n    of locales is defined as the opposite category of **Fra**.\n\n-   In [@sv], a frame and a locale are two distinct objects. A frame is\n    defined as above. But a locale $L$ is a triple $(F,P,\\models)$,\n    where $F$ is a frame, $P$ is the set of frame homomorphisms from $F$\n    to $\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$, the trivial frame (= the trivial Boolean\n    algebra), and $\\models$ is a subset (relation) of $P\\times F$ given\n    by $f \\models a$ iff $f(a)=1$. For each $a\\in F$, let\n    $U(a)=\\lbrace f\\in P\\mid f\\models a\\rbrace$. It is not hard to see\n    that the collection of all sets of the form $U(a)$ forms a topology\n    on $P$. As a result, every frame can be viewed as a topology on some\n    set!\n\n[8]{} F. Borceux, [*Handbook of Categorical Algebra 3: Categories of\nSheaves*]{}, Cambridge University Press (1994). G.
