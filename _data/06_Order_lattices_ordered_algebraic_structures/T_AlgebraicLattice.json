  "definition": "A lattice $L$ is said to be an *algebraic lattice* if it is a complete\nlattice and every element of $L$ can be written as a join of compact\nelements.\n\nAs the name (G. Birkhoff originally coined the term) suggests, algebraic\nlattices are mostly found in lattices of subalgebras of algebraic\nsystems. Below are some common examples.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  Groups. The lattice $L(G)$ of subgroups of a group $G$ is known to\n    be complete. Cyclic subgroups are compact elements of $L(G)$. Since\n    every subgroup $H$ of $G$ is the join of cyclic subgroups, each\n    generated by an element $h\\in H$, $L(G)$ is algebraic.\n\n2.  Vector spaces. The lattice $L(V)$ of subspaces of a vector space $V$\n    is complete. Since each subspace has a basis, and since each element\n    generates a one-dimensional subspace which is clearly compact,\n    $L(V)$ is algebraic.\n\n3.  Rings. The lattice $L(R)$ of ideals of a ring $R$ is also complete,\n    the join of a set of ideals of $R$ is the ideal generated by\n    elements in each of the ideals in the set. Any ideal $I$ is the join\n    of cyclic ideals generated by elements $r\\in I$. So $L(R)$ is\n    algebraic.\n\n4.  Modules. The above two examples can be combined and generalized into\n    one, the lattice $L(M)$ of submodules of a module $M$ over a ring.\n    The arguments are similar.\n\n5.  Topological spaces. The lattice of closed subsets of a topological\n    space is in general *not* algebraic. The simplest example is\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ with the open intervals forming the subbasis. To begin\n    with, it is not complete: the union of closed subsets\n    $[0,1-\\frac{1}{n}]$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is $[0,1)$, not a closed set.\n    In addition, $\\mathbb{R}$ itself is a closed subset that is not\n    compact.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   Since every element in an algebraic lattice is a join of compact\n    elements, it is easy to see that every atom is compact: for if $a$\n    is an atom in an algebraic lattice $L$, and $a=\\bigvee S$, where\n    $S\\subseteq L$ is a set of compact elements $s\\in L$, then each $s$\n    is either $0$ or $a$. Therefore, $S$ consists of at most two\n    elements $0$ and $a$. But $S$ can\u2019t be a singleton consisting of $0$\n    (otherwise $\\bigvee S=0\\neq a$), so $a\\in S$ and therefore $a$ is\n    compact.\n\n-   The notion of being algebraic in a lattice can be generalized to an\n    arbitrary dcpo: an *algebraic dcpo* is a dcpo $D$ such that every\n    $a\\in D$ can be written as $a=\\bigvee C$, where $C$ is a directed\n    set (in $D$) such that each element in $C$ is compact.\n\n[8]{} G.
