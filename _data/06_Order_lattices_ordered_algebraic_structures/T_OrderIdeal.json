A subset $I$ of $P$ is said to be an *order ideal*\nif\n\n-   $I$ is a lower set: ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}I=I$, and\n\n-   $I$ is a directed set: $I$ is non-empty, and every pair of elements\n    in $I$ has an upper bound in $I$.\n\nAn order ideal is also called an ideal for short. An ideal is said to be\n*principal* if it has the form ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ for some $x\\in P$.\n\nGiven a subset $A$ of a poset $P$, we say that $B$ is the ideal\ngenerated by $A$ if $B$ is the smallest order ideal (of $P$) containing\n$A$. $B$ is denoted by $\\langle A\\rangle$. Note that $\\langle A\\rangle$\nexists iff $A$ is a directed set. In particular, for any $x\\in P$,\n${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is the ideal generated by $x$. Also, if $P$ is an\nupper semilattice, then for any $A\\subseteq P$, let $A'$ be the set of\nfinite joins of elements of $A$, then $A'$ is a directed set, and\n$\\langle A\\rangle={\\downarrow\\!\\!}A'$.\n\nDually, an *order filter* (or simply a *filter*) in $P$ is a non-empty\nsubset $F$ which is both an upper set and a filtered set (every pair of\nelements in $F$ has a lower bound in $F$). A *principal filter* is a\nfilter of the form ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$ for some $x\\in P$.\n\n**Remark**. This is a generalization of the notion of a in a set. In\nfact, both ideals and filters are generalizations of ideals and filters\nin semilattices and lattices.\n\n### Examples in a Semilattice {#examples-in-a-semilattice .unnumbered}\n\nA subset $I$ in an upper semilattice $P$ is a *semilattice ideal* if\n\n1.  if $a,b\\in I$, then $a\\vee b\\in I$ (condition for being an upper\n    subsemilattice)\n\n2.  if $a\\in I$ and $b\\le a$, then $b\\in I$\n\nThen the two definitions are equivalent: if $P$ is an upper semilattice,\nthen $I\\subseteq P$ is a semilattice ideal iff $I$ is an order ideal of\n$P$: if $I$ is a semilattice ideal, then $I$ is clearly a lower and\ndirected (since $a\\vee b$ is an upper bound of $a$ and $b$); if $I$ is\nan order ideal, then condition 2 of a semilattice ideal is satisfied. If\n$a,b\\in I$, then there is a $c\\in I$ that is an upper bound of $a$ and\n$b$. Since $I$ is lower, and $a\\vee b\\le c$, we have $a\\vee b\\in I$.\n\nGoing one step further, we see that if $P$ is a lattice, then a lattice\nideal is exactly an order ideal: if $I$ is a lattice ideal, then it is\nclearly an upper subsemilattice, and if $b\\le a\\in I$, then\n$b=a\\wedge b\\in I$ also, so that $I$ is a semilattice ideal. On the\nother hand, if $I$ is a semilattice ideal, then $I$ is an upper\nsubsemilattice, as well as a lower subsemilattice, for if $a\\in I$, then\n$a\\wedge b\\in I$ as well since $a\\wedge b\\le a$. This shows that $I$ is\na lattice ideal.\n\nDually, we can define a *filter* in a lower semilattice, which is\nequivalent to an order filter of the underly poset. Going one step\nfuther, we also see that a lattice filter in a lattice is an order\nfilter of the underlying poset.\n\n**Remark**. An alternative but equivalent characterization of a\nsemilattice ideal $I$ in an upper semilattice $P$ is the following:\n$a,b\\in I$ iff $a\\vee b\\in I$.",
