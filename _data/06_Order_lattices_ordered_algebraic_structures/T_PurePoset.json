  "definition": "A poset is *pure* if it is finite and every maximal chain has the same\nlength. If [[*P*]{}]{} is a pure poset, we can create a rank function\n[[*r*]{}]{} on [[*P*]{}]{} by defining [[*r*]{}]{}([[*x*]{}]{}) to be\nthe length of a maximal chain bounded above by [[*x*]{}]{}. Every\ninterval of a pure poset is a graded poset, and every graded poset is\npure. Moreover, the closure of a pure poset, formed by adjoining an\nartificial minimum element and an artificial maximum element, is always\ngraded.\n\nThe face poset of a pure simplicial complex is pure as a poset.",
