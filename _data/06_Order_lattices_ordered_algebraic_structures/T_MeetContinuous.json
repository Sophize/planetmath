  "definition": "Let $L$ be a meet semilattice. We say that $L$ is *meet continuous* if\n\n1.  for any monotone net $D=\\lbrace x_i \\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ in $L$, its\n    supremum $\\bigvee D$ exists, and\n\n2.  for any $a\\in L$ and any monotone net\n    $\\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$,\n    $$a\\wedge \\bigvee \\lbrace x_i \\mid i\\in I \\rbrace = \\bigvee \\lbrace a\\wedge x_i\\mid i\\in I \\rbrace.$$\n\nA monotone net $\\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ is a net $x:I\\to L$ such\nthat $x$ is a non-decreasing function; that is, for any $i\\le j$ in $I$,\n$x_i\\le x_j$ in $L$.\n\nNote that we could have replaced the first condition by saying simply\nthat $D\\subseteq L$ is a directed set. (A monotone net is a directed\nset, and a directed set is a trivially a monotone net, by considering\nthe identity function as the net). It\u2019s not hard to see that if $D$ is a\ndirected subset of $L$, then\n$a\\wedge D:=\\lbrace a\\wedge x\\mid x\\in D\\rbrace$ is also directed, so\nthat the right hand side of the second condition makes sense.\n\nDually, a join semilattice $L$ is *join continuous* if its dual (as a\nmeet semilattice) is meet continuous. In other words, for any antitone\nnet $D=\\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$, its infimum $\\bigwedge D$ exists\nand that\n$$a\\vee \\bigwedge \\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace =\\bigwedge \\lbrace a\\vee x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace.$$\nAn antitone net is just a net $x:I\\to L$ such that for $i\\le j$ in $I$,\n$x_j\\le x_i$ in $L$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   A meet continuous lattice is a complete lattice, since a poset such\n    that finite joins and directed joins exist is a complete lattice\n    (see the link below for a proof of this).\n\n-   Let a lattice $L$ be both meet continuous and join continuous. Let\n    $\\lbrace x_i\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ be any net in $L$. We define the\n    following:\n    $$\\overline{\\lim}\\ x_i = \\bigwedge_{j\\in I} \\lbrace \\bigvee_{j\\le i} x_i\\rbrace\\qquad\\mbox{ and }\\qquad\\underline{\\lim}\\ x_i = \\bigvee_{j\\in I} \\lbrace \\bigwedge_{i\\le j} x_i\\rbrace$$\n    If there is an $x\\in L$ such that\n    $\\overline{\\lim}\\ x_i=x=\\underline{\\lim}\\ x_i$, then we say that the\n    net $\\lbrace x_i\\rbrace$ *order converges* to $x$, and we write\n    $x_i\\to x$, or $x=\\lim\\ x_i$. Now, define a subset $C\\subseteq L$ to\n    be *closed* (in $L$) if for any net $\\lbrace x_i\\rbrace$ in $C$ such\n    that $x_i\\to x$ implies that $x\\in C$, and *open* if its set\n    complement is closed, then $L$ becomes a topological lattice. With\n    respect to this topology, meet $\\wedge$ and join $\\vee$ are easily\n    seen to be continuous.\n\n[8]{} G. Birkhoff, [*Lattice Theory*]{}, 3rd Edition, Volume 25, AMS,\nProvidence (1967).
