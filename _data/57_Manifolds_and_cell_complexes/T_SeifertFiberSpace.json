  "definition": "In the field of three dimensional manifolds there is a kind which can be\nconsidered as spaces which are fibered by , that is, for each point in\nthe space there is a unique circle (a homeomorph of $S^1$) which\ncontains it.\n\nA Seifert fiber space can be defined as a circle bundle over an\norbifold, however these kind of 3-manifolds appeared much earlier than\nthe concept of fiber-bundle.\n\nTo construct them one must begin learning how to fiber a solid torus.\nNaturally a solid torus $D^2\\times S^1$ is foliated by circles\n$p\\times S^1$ where $p\\in D^2$.\n\nTo get different fibered solid tori one must begin with a solid torus\n$D^2\\times S^1$, cut it along a meridian disk and twist the resulting\nsolid cylinder by a rational angle $2\\pi(a/b)$ (being $a,b$ coprime) and\nreglue to obtain a new fibering by circles of the old torus, where the\nfibers all are still longitudinal circles but differs by the previous\none in the fact that now only the center\u2019s disk is a trivial circle but\nany other point in the disk is in a circle which is $b$ times longer\nthat the central one.\n\nIt is possible construct an associated 2-manifold identifying each fiber\nto a point to get the so called [**orbit surface**]{}.\n\n[**References**]{}\n\nH.
