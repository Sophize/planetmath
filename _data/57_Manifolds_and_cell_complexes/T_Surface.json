  "definition": "A *surface* is a two-dimensional topological manifold. A closed surface\nis a surface without boundary.\n\nA result called the \u201cclassification theorem\u201d gives us a symbolic\nsemantics, matching the geometrical view point, in terms of genera,\norientability and number of boundary components. Together with the\nconnected sum operation, they make available a powerful language to be\nexplored and exploited.\n\nAs an example of a surface take $T=S^1\\times S^1$ the two torus, the\nboundary of a solid sugar donut shaped cake $D^2\\times S^1$, where $S^1$\nis the familiar modulus one complex numbers.",
