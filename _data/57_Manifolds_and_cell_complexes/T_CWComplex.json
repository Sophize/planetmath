  "definition": "A Hausdorff topological space $X$ is said to be a [*CW\u00a0complex*]{} if it\nthe following conditions:\n\n1.  There exists a filtration by subspaces\n    $${{X}^{(-1)}}\\subseteq{{X}^{(0)}}\\subseteq {{X}^{(1)}}\\subseteq {{X}^{(2)}}\\subseteq\\cdots$$\n    with $X=\\bigcup\\limits_{n\\ge -1} {{X}^{(n)}}.$\n\n2.  ${{X}^{(-1)}}$ is empty, and, for $n\\ge 0, {{X}^{(n)}}$ is obtained\n    from ${{X}^{(n-1)}}$ by attachment of a collection\n    ${{\\left\\{e_\\iota^n:\\:\\iota\\in I_n\\right\\}}}$ of $n$-cells.\n\n3.  [*(\u201cclosure-finite\u201d)*]{} Every closed cell is contained in a finite\n    union of open cells.\n\n4.  [*(\u201cweak topology\u201d)*]{} $X$ has the weak topology with respect to\n    the collection of all cells. That is, $A\\subset X$ is closed in $X$\n    if and only if the intersection of $A$ with every closed cell $e$ is\n    closed in $e$ with respect to the subspace topology.\n\nThe letters \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018W\u2019 stand for \u201cclosure-finite\u201d and \u201cweak topology,\u201d\nrespectively. In particular, this means that one shouldn\u2019t look too\nclosely at the initials of J.H.C.\u00a0Whitehead, who invented CW\u00a0complexes.\n\nThe subspace ${{X}^{(n)}}$ is called the $n$-skeleton of $X.$ Note that\nthere normally are many possible choices of a filtration by skeleta for\na given CW\u00a0complex. A particular choice of skeleta and attaching maps\nfor the cells is called a [*CW\u00a0structure*]{} on the space.\n\nIntuitively, $X$ is a CW\u00a0complex if it can be constructed, starting from\na discrete space, by first attaching one-cells, then two-cells, and so\non. Note that the definition above does not allow one to attach\n$k$-cells before $h$-cells if $k>h.$ While some authors allow this in\nthe definition, it seems to be common usage to restrict CW\u00a0complexes to\nthe definition given here, and to call a space constructed by cell\nattachment with unrestricted order of dimensions a [*cell complex.*]{}\nThis is not essential for homotopy purposes, since any cell complex is\nhomotopy equivalent to a CW\u00a0complex.\n\nCW\u00a0complexes are a generalization of simplicial complexes, and have some\nof the same advantages. In particular, they allow inductive reasoning on\nthe of skeleta. However, CW\u00a0complexes are far more flexible than\nsimplicial complexes. For a space $X$ drawn from \u201ceveryday\u201d topological\nspaces, it is a good bet that it is homotopy equivalent, or even\nhomeomorphic, to a CW\u00a0complex. This includes, for instance, smooth\nfinite-dimensional manifolds, algebraic varieties, certain smooth\ninfinite-dimensional manifolds (such as Hilbert manifolds), and loop\nspaces of CW\u00a0complexes. This makes the category of spaces homotopy\nequivalent to a CW\u00a0complex a very popular category for doing homotopy\ntheory.\n\nThere is potential for confusion in the way words like \u201copen\u201d and\n\u201cinterior\u201d are used for cell complexes. If $e^k$ is a closed $k$-cell in\nCW\u00a0complex $X$ it does [*not*]{} follow that the corresponding open cell\n${\\smash{\\overset{\\circ}e}}^k$ is an open set of $X.$ It is, however, an\nopen set of the $k$-skeleton. Also, while ${\\smash{\\overset{\\circ}e}}^k$\nis often referred to as the \u201cinterior\u201d of $e^k,$ it is not necessarily\nthe case that it is the interior of $e^k$ in the sense of pointset\ntopology. In particular, any closed $0$-cell is its own corresponding\nopen $0$-cell, even though it has empty interior in most cases.",
