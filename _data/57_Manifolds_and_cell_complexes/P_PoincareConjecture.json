  "statement": "Until its proof in 2003, the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture was the central problem\nof low-dimensional topology. It is one of the , and so far the only one\nto be solved.\n\n[**Theorem**]{} *Every 3-manifold without boundary that is homotopy\nequivalent to the $3$-sphere is in fact homeomorphic to it.* Or, in a\nmore elementary form: *every simply-connected compact $3$-manifold\nwithout boundary is homeomorphic to $S^3$*.\n\nThe first statement is also true when $3$ is replaced by any other\npositive integer, but the 3-dimensional case turned out to be much\nharder than the other cases.\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture was eventually proved by Grigoriy Perelman, who\ngave his proof in a series of preprints posted on arXiv.org in 2002 and\n2003. For this work Perelman was offered a Fields Medal in 2006, though\nhe declined it. On 18 March 2010, he was awarded the \\$1,000,000\nMillennium Prize for resolution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, but has also\ndeclined this prize. (The long delay in the awarding of the Millennium\nPrize was largely due to the way that Perelman chose to publish his\nresults. Full details of his proof did not appear in a peer reviewed\nmathematical publication until 2006, and the Millennium Prize rules\nrequire a waiting period of two years after such publication before the\nprize can be awarded.)\n\nSee also (PDF file), and the .",
