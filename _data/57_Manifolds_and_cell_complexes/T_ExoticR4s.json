  "definition": "If $n \\neq 4$ then the smooth manifolds homeomorphic to a given\ntopological $n$- manifold, $M$, are parameterized by some discrete\nalgebraic invariant of $M$. In particular there is a unique smooth\nmanifold homeomorphic to ${\\mathbb R}^n$.\n\nBy contrast one may choose uncountably many open sets in\n${\\mathbb R}^4$, which are all homeomorphic to ${\\mathbb R}^4$, but\nwhich are pairwise non-diffeomorphic.\n\nA smooth manifold homeomorphic to ${\\mathbb R}^4$, but not diffeomorphic\nto it is called an *exotic* ${\\mathbb R}^4$.\n\nGiven an exotic ${\\mathbb R}^4$, $E$, we have a diffeomorphism\n$E \\times {\\mathbb R}\\to {\\mathbb R}^5$. (As there is only one smooth\nmanifold homeomorphic to ${\\mathbb R}^5$). Hence exotic\n${\\mathbb R}^4$\u2019s may be identified with closed submanifolds of\n${\\mathbb R}^5$. In particular this means the cardinality of the set of\nexotic ${\\mathbb R}^4$\u2019s is precisely continuum.\n\nHistorically, Donaldson\u2019s theorem led to the discovery of the Donaldson\nFreedman exotic ${\\mathbb R}^4$.",
