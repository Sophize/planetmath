  "definition": "The [*motivic cohomology*]{} is \u201cthe algebraic version of singular\ncohomology, ... an algebraic homology-like theory built out of the free\nabelian group on the algebraic subvarieties of \\[a regular\nalgebro-geometric version of a manifold\\] $X$, the algebraic cycles on\n$X$.\u201d (Levine, 1997) This theory devised by Alexander Grothendieck and\nEnrico Bombieri to derive a conditional proof of the Weil conjectures\nemploying algebraic geometry. Its inventors expected motivic cohomology\nto be a total generalization of all homology theories and Pierre Deligne\npointed the way with his absolute Hodge cycles.\n\nSince motivic cohomology is a type of cohomology theory defined for\nschemes, in particular, algebraic varieties, there are a couple of\ndifferent ways to define it. The Zariski topology is so poor from an\nalgebraic topology standpoint, alternative methods are required.\n\nThe first definition of motivic cohomolgy was only for rational\ncoefficients. Recall that in topology, one has isomorphisms\n$$K^*(X)_\\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\oplus_i H^i(X,\\mathbb{Q})$$ given by the\nChern character. Motivic cohomology is a theory which adapts this to the\nalgebraic setting.\n\nActually, before this was done in topology, Grothendieck had done this\nfor $K_0$ of schemes where the \u2019cohomology theory\u2019 was the Chow ring\n$CH^*(X)$, namely\n$$K_0(X)_\\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\oplus_i CH^i(X)_\\mathbb{Q}$$ Recall that the\nring $CH^i(X)$ is the free abelain group of codimension $i$ subvarieties\nof $X$ modulo rational equivalence.\n\nMotivic cohomology was motivated by these two facts. Namely, weight zero\nmotivic cohomology are the Chow groups, and rationally is the graded\npieces (with respect to the gamma filtration) of the group $K_0(X)$.\nMotivic cohomology in higher weights then corresponds to Bloch\u2019s higher\nChow groups, and rationally coincides with graded pieces of higher\nalgebraic $K$-theory $K_i(X)$.\n\nIf $\\Delta^n$ denotes the algebraic $n$-simplex given by the single\nequation $t_0 + \\ldots + t_n = 1$, then let $z^q(X,n)$ denote the group\nof algebraic cycles on $X \\times \\Delta^n$ of codimension $q$ which\nintersect each face of $\\Delta^n$ properly. This intersection condition\nallows one to turn $z^q(X,n)$ into a simplicial abelian group in the\nindex $q$, and hence a chain complex. The cohomology groups of this\nchain complex (or equivalently, the homotopy group of the simplicial\nabelian group) are denoted $CH^q(X,n)$ are are called higher Chow\ngroups, and were introduced by Bloch. They provide one of the possible\nequivalent definitions of motivic cohomology, and one has\n\n$$K_i(X)_\\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\oplus_j CH^j(X,i)_\\mathbb{Q}.$$\n\nAnother definition comes from the work of Suslin and Voevodsky, which is\nmore technical. For a smooth scheme of finite type over a field $k$, let\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(X)(Y)$ denote the free abelain group of closed integral\nsubschemes of $X \\times Y$ whose support is finite and surjective over a\ncomponent of $X$. Then $\\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(X)$ becomes a presheaf, and is\nactually a sheaf in the Zariski, Nisnevich, and \u00e9tale topologies. Then\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(\\mathbb{G}_m^{\\wedge q})$ is defined to be\n$Z(q) = \\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(\\mathbb{G}_m^{\\times q})$ mod out the images of\n$\\mathbb{G}_m^{\\times q-1}$ via the $q$ embeddings with one coordinate\nequal to $1$.\n\nFor any presheaf $F$, let $C_*(F)$ denote the chain complex, where in\nweight $n$ we have $C_n(F)(X) = F(\\Delta^n \\times X)$. Then the motivic\ncomplex is given by $C_*\\mathbb{Z}_{tr}(\\mathbb{G}_m^{\\wedge q})[-q]$,\nwhere the $[-q]$ means shift by $q$. The motivic cohomology groups are\nthen defined to be the hypercohomology of this complexes of sheaves,\ntaken in either the Zariski or Nisnevich topologies:\n\n$$H^p(X,\\mathbb{Z}(q)) = \\mathbb{H}^p_{Zar}(X,\\mathbb{Z}(q))$$\n\nSuslin has shown that the above two deifnitions of motivic cohomology\nagree. There are other defintions by Voevodsky, who constructed a\ntriangulated category of motives, and a motivic homotopy category, in\nwhich motivic cohomology theory (among other theories) are\nrepresentable.\n\n[3]{} Marc Levine, \u201cHomology of algebraic varieties: An introduction to\nthe works of Suslin and Voevodsky\u201d, [*Bull.
