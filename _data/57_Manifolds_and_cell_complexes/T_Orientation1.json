  "definition": "There are many definitions of an orientation of a manifold. The most\ngeneral, in the sense that it doesn\u2019t require any extra on the manifold,\nis based on (co-)homology theory. For this article manifold means a\nconnected, [*topological*]{} manifold possibly with boundary.\n\nLet $M$ be a closed, $n$\u2013dimensional *manifold*. Then\n$H_n(M\\,;\\mathbb{Z})$ the top dimensional homology group of $M$, is\neither trivial ($\\{0\\}$) or isomorphic to $ \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA closed $n$\u2013manifold is called *orientable* if its top homology group\nis isomorphic to the integers. An *orientation* of $M$ is a choice of a\nparticular isomorphism\n$$\\mathfrak{o}\\co \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_n(M\\,;\\mathbb{Z}).$$ An oriented\nmanifold is a (necessarily orientable) manifold $M$ endowed with an\norientation. If $(M,\\mathfrak{o})$ is an oriented manifold then\n$\\mathfrak{o}(1)$ is called the *fundamental class* of $M$ , or the\n*orientation class* of $M$, and is denoted by $[M]$.\n\nNotice that since $\\mathbb{Z}$ has exactly two automorphisms an\norientable manifold admits two possible orientations.\n\nThe above definition could be given using cohomology instead of\nhomology.\n\nThe top dimensional homology of a non-closed manifold is always trivial,\nso it is trickier to define orientation for those beasts. One approach\n(which we will not follow) is to use special kind of homology (for\nexample relative to the boundary for compact manifolds with boundary).\nThe approach we follow defines (global) orientation as compatible\nfitting together of local orientations. We start with manifolds without\nboundary.\n\nLet $M$ be an $n$-manifold without boundary and $x\\in\n  M$. Then the relative homology group\n$$H_n(M,M\\setminus x\\,;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$$\n\nLet $M$ be an $n$-manifold and $x\\in M$. An [*orientation of*]{} $M$\n[*at*]{} $x$ is a choice of an isomorphism\n$$\\mathfrak{o}_x \\co \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_n(M,M\\setminus x\\,;\\mathbb{Z}).$$\n\nto make precise the notion of nicely fitting together of orientations at\npoints, is to require that for nearby points the orientations are\ndefined in a way.\n\nLet $U$ be an open subset of $M$ that is homeomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ (e.g. the domain of a chart). Then,\n$$H_n(M,M\\setminus U \\,; {\\mathbb{Z}})\\cong {\\mathbb{Z}}.$$\n\nLet $U$ be an open subset of $M$ that is homeomorphic to\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. A *local orientation* of $M$ on $U$ is a choice of an\nisomorphism\n$$\\mathfrak{o}_U \\co H_n(M,M\\setminus U \\,; {\\mathbb{Z}}) \\to {\\mathbb{Z}}.$$\n\nNow notice that with $U$ as above and $x\\in U$ the inclusion\n$$\\imath^U_x\\co M\\setminus U  \\hookrightarrow  M\\setminus x$$ a map\n(actually isomorphism)\n$$\\imath^U_{x\\,\\,*}\\co H_n(M,M\\setminus U \\,; {\\mathbb{Z}}) \\to H_n(M,M\\setminus x\\,;\\mathbb{Z})$$\nand therefore a local orientation at $U$ (by composing with the above\nisomorphism) an orientation at each point $x\\in U$. It is to declare\nthat all these orientations fit nicely together.\n\nLet $M$ be a manifold with non-empty boundary, $\\partial M\\neq\n  \\emptyset$. $M$ is called *orientable* if its double\n$$\\hat{M}:=M\\bigcup_{\\partial M}M$$ is orientable, where\n$\\bigcup_{\\partial M}$ denotes gluing along the boundary.An orientation\nof $M$ is determined by an orientation of $\\hat{M}$.",
