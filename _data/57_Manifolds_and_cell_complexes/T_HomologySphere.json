  "definition": "A compact $n$-manifold $M$ is called a [*homology sphere*]{} if its\nhomology is that of the $n$-sphere $S^n$, i.e.\n$H_0(M;{\\mathbb{Z}})\\cong H_n(M;{\\mathbb{Z}})\\cong{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and is\nzero otherwise.\n\nAn application of the Hurewicz theorem and homological Whitehead theorem\nshows that any simply connected homology sphere is in fact homotopy\nequivalent to $S^n$, and hence homeomorphic to $S^n$ for $n\\neq 3$, by\nthe higher dimensional equivalent of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.\n\nThe original version of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture stated that every 3\ndimensional homology sphere was homeomorphic to $S^3$, but Poincar\u00e9\nhimself found a counter-example. There are, in fact, a number of\ninteresting 3-dimensional homology spheres.",
