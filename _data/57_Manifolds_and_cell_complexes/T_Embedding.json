  "definition": "Let $M$ and $N$ be manifolds and $f\\colon M\\to N$ a smooth map. Then $f$\nis an *embedding* if\n\n1.  $f(M)$ is a submanifold of $N$, and\n\n2.  $f\\colon M\\to f(M)$ is a diffeomorphism. (There\u2019s an abuse of\n    notation here. This should really be restated as the map\n    $g\\colon M\\to f(M)$ defined by $g(p)=f(p)$ is a diffeomorphism.)\n\nThe above characterization can be equivalently stated: $f\\colon M\\to N$\nis an embedding if\n\n1.  $f$ is an immersion, and\n\n2.  by abuse of notation, $f\\colon M\\to f(M)$ is a homeomorphism.\n\n**Remark**. A celebrated theorem of Whitney states that every $n$\ndimensional manifold admits an embedding into $\\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$.",
