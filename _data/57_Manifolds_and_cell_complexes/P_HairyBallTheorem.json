  "statement": "If $X$ is a vector field on $S^{2n}$, then $X$ has a zero.\nAlternatively, there are no continuous unit vector field on the sphere.\nMoreover, the tangent bundle of the sphere is nontrivial as a bundle,\nthat is, it is not simply a product.\n\nThere are two proofs for this. The first proof is based on the fact that\nthe antipodal map on $S^{2n}$ is not homotopic to the identity map. The\nsecond proof gives the as a corollary of the Poincar\u00e9-Hopf index\ntheorem.\n\nNear a zero of a vector field, we can consider a small sphere around the\nzero, and restrict the vector field to that. By normalizing, we get a\nmap from the sphere to itself. We define the index of the vector field\nat a zero to be the degree of that map.\n\nIf $X$ is a vector field on a compact manifold $M$ with isolated zeroes,\nthen $\\chi(M)=\\sum_{v\\in Z(X)}\\iota(v)$ where $Z(X)$ is the set of\nzeroes of $X$, and $\\iota(v)$ is the index of $x$ at $v$, and $\\chi(M)$\nis the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n\nIt is not difficult to show that $S^{2n+1}$ has non-vanishing vector\nfields for all $n$. A much harder result of Adams shows that the tangent\nbundle of $S^m$ is trivial if and only if $n=0,1,3,7$, corresponding to\nthe unit spheres in the 4 real division algebras.\n\nFirst, the low tech proof. Assume that $S^{2n}$ has a unit vector field\n$X$. Then the . But this cannot be, since the degree of the antipodal\nmap is $-1$ and the degree of the identity map is $+1$. We therefore\nreject the assumption that $X$ is a unit vector field.\n\nThis also implies that the tangent bundle of $S^{2n}$ is non-trivial,\nsince any trivial bundle has a non-zero section.\n\nNow for the sledgehammer proof. Suppose $X$ is a nonvanishing vector\nfield on $S^{2n}$. Then by the Poincar\u00e9-Hopf index theorem, the Euler\ncharacteristic of $S^{2n}$ is $\\chi(X)=\\sum_{v\\in X^{-1}(0)}\\iota(v)=0$.\nBut the Euler characteristic of $S^{2k}$ is $2$. Hence $X$ must have a\nzero.",
