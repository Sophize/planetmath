  "definition": "An $M$ is called *irreducible* if for each embedding of a standard\n$(n-1)$-sphere $S^{n-1}$ in $M$, there is an embedding of a $D^n$ in $M$\nsuch that the image of the boundary $\\partial D^n$ coincides with the\nimage of $S^{n-1}$.\n\nIn case of dimension three it can be proved that each irreducible\n3-manifold is also a 3-manifold.",
