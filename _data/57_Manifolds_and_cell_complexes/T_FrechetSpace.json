  "definition": "We consider two classes of topological vector spaces, one more general\nthan the other. Following Rudin [@rudin_fa] we will define a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace to be an element of the smaller class, and refer to an instance of\nthe more general class as an *F-space*. After giving the definitions, we\nwill explain why one definition is stronger than the other.\n\n#### Definition 1.\n\nAn F-space is a complete topological vector space whose topology is\ninduced by a translation invariant metric. To be more precise, we say\nthat $U$ is an F-space if there exists a metric function\n$$d:U\\times U\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{R}}$$ such that\n$$d(x,y)=d(x+z,y+z),\\quad x,y,z\\in U;$$ and such that the collection of\nballs $$B_\\epsilon(x)=\\{y\\in U: d(x,y)<\\epsilon\\},\\quad x\\in U,\\;\n\\epsilon>0$$ is a base for the topology of $U$.\n\n#### Note 1.\n\nRecall that a topological vector space is a uniform space. The\nhypothesis that $U$ is complete is formulated in reference to this\nuniform structure. To be more precise, we say that a sequence $a_n\\in\nU,\\; n=1,2,\\ldots$ is Cauchy if for every neighborhood $O$ of the origin\nthere exists an $N\\in{\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $a_n-a_m\\in O$ for all\n$n,m>N$. The completeness condition then takes the usual form of the\nhypothesis that all Cauchy sequences possess a limit point.\n\n#### Note 2.\n\nIt is customary to include the hypothesis that $U$ is Hausdorff in the\ndefinition of a topological vector space. Consequently, a Cauchy\nsequence in a complete topological space will have a unique limit.\n\n#### Note 3.\n\nSince $U$ is assumed to be complete, the pair $(U,d)$ is a complete\nmetric space. Thus, an equivalent definition of an F-space is that of a\nvector space equipped with a complete, translation-invariant (but not\nnecessarily ) metric, such that the operations of scalar multiplication\nand vector addition are continuous with respect to this metric.\n\n#### Definition 2.\n\nA Fr\u00e9chet space is a complete topological vector space (either real or\ncomplex) whose topology is induced by a countable family of semi-norms.\nTo be more precise, there exist semi-norm functions\n$$\\Vert - \\Vert_n : U \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{R}},\\quad n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},$$\nsuch that the collection of all balls\n$$B_{\\epsilon}^{(n)}(x) = \\{ y \\in U : \\Vert x-y\\Vert_n < \\epsilon\\},\\quad\nx\\in U,\\; \\epsilon>0,\\; n\\in{\\mathbb{N}},$$ is a base for the topology\nof $U$.\n\nLet $U$ be a complete topological vector space. Then, $U$ is a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace if and only if it is a locally convex F-space.\n\n*Proof.* First, let us show that a Fr\u00e9chet space is a locally convex\nF-space, and then prove the converse. Suppose then that $U$ is Fr\u00e9chet.\nThe semi-norm balls are convex; this follows directly from the semi-norm\naxioms. Therefore $U$ is locally convex. To obtain the desired distance\nfunction we set $$\\label{eq:ddef}\nd(x,y) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2^{-n} \\frac{\\Vert x-y \\Vert_n}{1+\\Vert\nx-y\\Vert_n},\\quad x,y\\in U.$$\n\nWe now show that $d$ satisfies the metric axioms. Let $x,y \\in U$ such\nthat $x\\neq y$ be given. Since $U$ is Hausdorff, there is at least one\nseminorm such $$\\Vert x-y\\Vert_n >0.$$ Hence $d(x,y)>0$.\n\nLet $a,b,c>0$ be three real numbers such that $$a\\leq b+c.$$ A\nstraightforward calculation shows that $$\\label{eq:ineq}\n\\frac{a}{1+a}\\leq \\frac{b}{1+b}+\\frac{c}{1+c},$$ as well. The above\ntrick underlies the definition of our metric function. By the seminorm\naxioms we have that\n$$\\Vert x-z \\Vert_n \\leq \\Vert x-y \\Vert_n + \\Vert y-z \\Vert_n,\\quad\nx,y,z\\in U$$ for all $n$. Combining this with and yields the triangle\ninequality for $d$.\n\nNext let us suppose that $U$ is a locally convex F-space, and prove that\nit is Fr\u00e9chet. For every $n=1,2,\\ldots$ let $U_n$ be an open convex\nneighborhood of the origin, contained inside a ball of radius $1/n$\nabout the origin. Let $\\Vert - \\Vert_n$ be the seminorm with $U_n$ as\nthe unit ball. By definition, the unit balls of these seminorms give a\nneighborhood base for the topology of $U$.
