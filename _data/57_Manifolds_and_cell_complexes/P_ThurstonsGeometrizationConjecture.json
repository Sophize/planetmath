  "statement": "[*Thurston\u2019s geometrization conjecture*]{}, also known simply as the\n[*geometrization conjecture*]{}, states that compact 3-manifolds can be\ndecomposed into pieces with geometric structures. The geometrization\nconjecture is an analogue for 3-manifolds of the uniformization theorem\nfor surfaces. It was proposed by William Thurston in the late 1970s, and\nimplies several other conjectures, such as the Poincar\u00c3\u00a9 conjecture and\nThurston\u2019s elliptization conjecture.\n\nGrigori Perelman sketched a proof of the geometrization conjecture in\n2003 using Ricci flow with surgery, which (as of 2006) appears to be\nessentially correct.\n\nThe conjecture\n==============\n\nA 3-manifold is called closed if it is compact and has no boundary.\n\nEvery closed 3-manifold has a prime decomposition: this means it is the\nconnected sum of an essentially unique collection of prime\nthree-manifolds. This reduces much of the study of 3-manifolds to the\ncase of prime 3-manifolds: those that cannot be written as a non-trivial\nconnected sum.\n\nEvery prime closed 3-manifold can be cut along tori, so that the\ninterior of each of the resulting manifolds has a geometric structure\nwith finite volume.\n\nThere are 8 possible geometric structures in 3 dimensions, described in\nthe next section. Cutting a prime 3-manifold along tori into pieces that\nare Seifert manifolds or atoroidal is called the JSJ decomposition:\nthere is a minimal way of doing this, which is essentially unique.\n\nThere are similar statements for compact manifolds with boundary without\n$S^2$ boundary components.\n\nIn 2 dimensions the analogous statement says that every surface (without\nboundary) has a geometric structure consisting of a metric with constant\ncurvature; it is not necessary to cut the manifold up first.\n\nThe eight Thurston geometries\n=============================\n\nA model geometry is a simply connected smooth manifold $M$ acted on by a\nLie group $G$, such that $G$ is maximal among groups acting smoothly and\ntransitively on $M$ with compact stabilizers, and there is at least one\ncompact manifold modeled on $M$.\n\nA geometric structure on a manifold is an isomorphism of the manifold\nwith $M\\Gamma$ for some model geometry $M$ where $\\Gamma$ is a discrete\nsubgroup of $G$ acting freely on $M$.\n\n$S^2$ is the round 2-sphere and $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is the hyperbolic plane.\n\nSeven of the eight geometries (all except hyperbolic) are now clearly\nunderstood and known to correspond to Seifert manifolds and torus\nbundles. Using information about Seifert manifolds, we can restate the\nconjecture more tersely as:\n\nEvery prime, compact 3-manifold falls into exactly one of the following\ncategories:\n\n-   It has a spherical geometry.\n\n-   It has a hyperbolic geometry,\n\n-   The fundamental group contains a free abelian group on two\n    generators (the fundamental group of a torus).\n\n-   It has $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ geometry.\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nIf Thurston\u2019s conjecture is correct, then so is the Poincar\u00c3\u00a9 conjecture\n(via Thurston\u2019s elliptization conjecture). The Fields Medal was awarded\nto Thurston in 1982 partially for his proof of the conjecture for Haken\nmanifolds.\n\nThe case of 3-manifolds that should be spherical has been slower, but\nprovided the spark needed for Richard Hamilton to develop his Ricci\nflow. In 1982, Hamilton showed that given a closed 3-manifold with a\nmetric of positive Ricci curvature, the Ricci flow would collapse the\nmanifold to a point in finite time, which proves the geometrization\nconjecture for this case as the metric becomes \u201calmost round\u201d just\nbefore the collapse. He later developed a program to prove the\nGeometrization Conjecture by Ricci flow.\n\nIn 2003 Grigori Perelman sketched a proof of the geometrization\nconjecture by extending Hamilton\u2019s Ricci flow program to include surgery\nwhenever the Ricci flow produces singularities. As of 2006 the consensus\namong those who have checked his work is that it is essentially correct,\nand the details have now been filled in. According to the Clay\nMathematics Institute, he may be eligible for the Institute\u2019s Millennium\nPrize Problems, although he has not submitted his work to a\npeer-reviewed journal.\n\n[*This entry was adapted from the Wikipedia article as of November 10,\n2006.*]{}\n\n[4]{} G.
