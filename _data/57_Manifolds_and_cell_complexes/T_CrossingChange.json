  "definition": "In a knot, a [*crossing change*]{} occurs when a positive crossing (or\ncrossing over) is followed by a negative crossing (or crossing under).\nAn alternating knot, for example, has exactly as many crossing changes\nas it has crossings.\n\nFor the purpose of illustrating crossing changes, a non-alternating knot\nis more interesting. In the following diagram, if we start at the point\nindicated by the blue dot and proceed clockwise, the red arrows indicate\ncrossing changes while the green arrows indicate a crossing the same as\nthe previous crossing. One crossing change after that and there are no\nfurther arrows in the diagram until the blue dot.\n\n![image](CrossingChangeDiagram)",
