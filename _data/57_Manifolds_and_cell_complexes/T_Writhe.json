  "definition": "The *writhe* of a link, also called its *twist number*, is the sum of\nthe signs of the link\u2019s crossings. In short, it is the sum of the\npositive crossings minus the sum of the negative crossings. Note that\nthe writhe is not an isotopy invariant and that is actually depends on\nthe regular homotopy class of its projection.",
