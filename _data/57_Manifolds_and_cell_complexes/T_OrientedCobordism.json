  "definition": "Two oriented $n$-manifolds $M$ and $M'$ are called [*cobordant*]{} if\nthere is an oriented $n+1$ manifold with boundary $N$ such that\n$\\partial N=M\\coprod M'^{opp}$ where $M'^{opp}$ is $M'$ with orientation\nreversed. The triple $(N,M,M')$ is called a [*oriented cobordism*]{}.\nCobordism is an equivalence relation, and a very coarse invariant of\nmanifolds. For example, all surfaces are cobordant to the empty set (and\nhence to each other).\n\nThere is a cobordism category, where the objects are manifolds, and the\nmorphisms are cobordisms between them. This category is important in\ntopological .",
