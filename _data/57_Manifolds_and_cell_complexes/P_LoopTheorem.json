  "statement": "In the topology of 3-manifolds, [**the loop theorem**]{} is\ngeneralization of an ansatz discovered by Max Dehn (namely, Dehn\u2019s\nlemma), who saw that [*if a continuous map from a 2-disk to a 3-manifold\nwhose restriction to the boundary\u2019s disk has no singularities, then\nthere exists another embedding whose restriction to the boundary\u2019s disk\nis equal to the boundary\u2019s restriction original map*]{}.\n\nThe following statement called the loop theorem is a version from J.\nStallings, but written in W. Jaco\u2019s book.\n\n[*Let $M$ be a three-manifold and let $S$ be a connected surface in\n$\\partial M $. Let $N\\subset \\pi_1(M)$ be a normal subgroup. Let\n$f \\colon D^2\\to M $ be a [**continuous map**]{} such that\n$f(\\partial D^2)\\subset S$ and $[f|\\partial D^2]\\notin N$.\\\nThen there exists an [**embedding**]{} $g\\colon D^2\\to M $ such that\n$g(\\partial D^2)\\subset S$ and $[g|\\partial D^2]\\notin N$*]{},\n\nThe proof is a clever construction due to C. Papakyriakopoulos about a\nsequence (a tower) of covering spaces. Maybe the best detailed\npresentation is due to A. Hatcher. But in general, accordingly to Jaco\u2019s\nopinion, [*\u201d... for anyone unfamiliar with the techniques of\n3-manifold-topology and are here to gain a working knowledge for the\nstudy of problems in this ..., there is no better to start.\u201d*]{}\n\n[**References**]{}\n\nW.
