Then there is a\nneighborhood $U$ of $\\Lambda$ such that for every $\\delta>0$ there is an\n$\\epsilon>0$ so that every $\\epsilon$- in $U$ is $\\delta$-shadowed by an\norbit of $f$.\n\nMoreover, there is $\\delta_0>0$ such that, if $\\delta<\\delta_0$ and if\nthe pseudo-orbit is bi-infinite, then the shadowing orbit is unique; and\nif $\\Lambda$ has a local product structure then the shadowing orbit is\nin $\\Lambda$.",
