  "definition": "As Strogatz says in reference \\[1\\], \u201cNo definition of the term chaos is\nuniversally accepted yet, but almost everyone would agree on the three\ningredients used in the following working definition\u201d.\n\nChaos is the aperiodic long-term in a deterministic system that exhibits\nsensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n\nAperiodic long-term means that there are trajectories which do not\nsettle down to fixed points, periodic , or quasiperiodic as\n$t \\to \\infty$. For the purposes of this definition, a trajectory which\napproaches a limit of $\\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$ should be considered to\nhave a fixed point at $\\infty$.\n\nSensitive dependence on initial conditions means that nearby\ntrajectories separate exponentially fast; , the system has a positive\nLiapunov exponent.\n\nStrogatz notes that he favors additional constraints on the aperiodic\nlong-term , but leaves what form they may take. He suggests two\nalternatives to fulfill this:\n\n1.  Requiring that there exists an open set of initial conditions having\n    aperiodic trajectories, or\n\n2.  If one picks a random initial condition $x(0)$ then there must be a\n    nonzero chance of the associated trajectory $x(t)$ being aperiodic.\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n1.  B.
