  "definition": "Given a metric space $(X,d)$ and an homeomorphism $f\\colon X\\to X$, we\nsay that $f$ is structurally stable if there is a neighborhood\n$\\mathscr{V}$ of $f$ in ${\\operatorname{Homeo}}(X)$ (the space of all\nhomeomorphisms mapping $X$ to itself endowed with the compact-open\ntopology) such that every element of $\\mathscr{V}$ is topologically\nconjugate to $f$.\n\nIf $M$ is a compact smooth manifold, a $\\mathcal{C}^k$ diffeomorphism\n$f$ is said to be $\\mathcal{C}^k$ structurally stable if there is a\nneighborhood of $f$ in ${\\operatorname{Diff}}^k(M)$ (the space of all\n$\\mathcal{C}^k$ diffeomorphisms from $M$ to itself endowed with the\nstrong $\\mathcal{C}^k$ topology) in which every element is topologically\nconjugate to $f$.\n\nIf $X$ is a vector field in the smooth manifold $M$, we say that $X$ is\n$\\mathcal{C}^k$-structurally stable if there is a neighborhood of $X$ in\n$\\mathscr{X}^k(M)$ (the space of all $\\mathcal{C}^k$ vector fields on\n$M$ endowed with the strong $\\mathcal{C}^k$ topology) in which every\nelement is topologically equivalent to $X$, i.e. such that every other\nfield $Y$ in that neighborhood generates a flow on $M$ that is\ntopologically equivalent to the flow generated by $X$.\n\n**Remark.** The concept of structural stability may be generalized to\nother spaces of functions with other topologies; the general idea is\nthat a function or flow is structurally stable if any other function or\nflow close enough to it has similar dynamics (from the topological\nviewpoint), which essentially means that the dynamics will not change\nunder small perturbations.",
