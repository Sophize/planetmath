Then there exists a\ndiffeomorphism $g$, arbitrarily close to $f$ in the $\\mathcal{C}^1$\ntopology of $\\operatorname{Diff}^1(M)$, such that $q$ is in the forward\norbit of $p$ through $g$, i.e. such that $g^n(p)=q$ for some $n>0$.\n\n[9]{} Wen, L., Xia, Z., *$\\mathcal{C}^1$ connecting lemmas*, Trans.\nAmer.
