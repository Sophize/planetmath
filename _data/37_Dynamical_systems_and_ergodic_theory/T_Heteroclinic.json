  "definition": "Let $f$ be an homeomorphism mapping a topological space $X$ to itself or\na flow on $X$. An heteroclinic point, or heteroclinic intersection, is a\npoint that belongs to the intersection of the stable set of $x$ with the\nunstable set of $y$, where $x$ and $y$ are two different fixed or\nperiodic points of $f$, i.e. a point that belongs to\n$W^s(f,x)\\cap W^u(f,y)$.",
