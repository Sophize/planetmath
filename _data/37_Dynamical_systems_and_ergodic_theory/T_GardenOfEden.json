Let\n$\\Acal = \\langle Q, \\Neigh, f \\rangle$ be a cellular automaton with no\norphan pattern. Let $c : G \\to Q$ be a configuration: we will prove that\nthere is some $e : G \\to Q$ such that\n$F_{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}(e) = c$.\n\nLet $G = \\{g_n\\}_{n \\geq 0}$ be an enumeration of $G$: put\n$E_n = \\{g_i \\mid i \\leq n\\}$ and let $p_n : E_n \\to Q$ be defined as\n$p_n = \\restrict{c}{E_n}.$ By hypothesis, none of the $p_n$\u2019s is an\norphan, so there is a sequence of configurations $c_n : G \\to Q$\nsatisfying $\\restrict{F_\\Acal(c_n)}{E_n} = p_n = \\restrict{c}{E_n}.$ It\nis easy to see that $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} F_\\Acal(c_{n_k}) = c.$ But if\n$Q$ is finite, then $Q^G$ is compact by Tychonoff\u2019s theorem, so there\nexista a subsequence $\\{ c_{n_k} \\}_{k \\geq 0}$ and a configuration\n$e : G \\to Q$ satisfying $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} c_{n_k} = e:$ Since\n$F_{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$ is continuous in the product topology,\n$F(e) = c$.\n\nLet now $G$ be arbitrary. Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by the\nneighborhood index ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{N}}}$: since\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{N}}}$ is finite, $H$ is countable. Let $J$ be a\nset of representatives of the left cosets of $H$ in $G$, so that\n$G = \\bigsqcup_{j \\in  J} jH.$ (Observe that we do *not* require that\n$H$ is normal in $G$.) Call ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}_H$ the cellular\nautomaton *on $H$* that has the same local description (set of states,\nneighborhood index, local function) as ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$. Let\n$c : G \\to Q$ be a Garden of Eden configuration for\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$: then at least one of the configurations\n$c_j(h) = c(jh)$ must be a Garden of Eden for\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}_H$. By the discussion above,\n${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}_H$ must have an orphan pattern, which is\nalso an orphan pattern for ${\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{A}}}$. $\\Box$",
