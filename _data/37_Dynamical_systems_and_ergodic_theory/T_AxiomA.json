  "definition": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. We say that a diffeomorphism\n$f\\colon M\\to M$ satisfies (Smale\u2019s) *Axiom A* (or that $f$ is an Axiom\nA diffeomorphism) if\n\n1.  the nonwandering set $\\Omega(f)$ has a hyperbolic structure;\n\n2.  the set of periodic points of $f$ is dense in $\\Omega(f)$:\n    $\\overline{{\\operatorname{Per}}(f)} = \\Omega(f)$.\n\nSometimes, Axiom A diffeomorphisms are called hyperbolic\ndiffeomorphisms, because the portion of $M$ where the \u201cinteresting\u201d\ndynamics occur (namely, $\\Omega(f)$) has a hyperbolic behaviour.",
