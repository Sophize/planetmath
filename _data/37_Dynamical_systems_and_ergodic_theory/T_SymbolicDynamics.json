  "definition": "In mathematics, [*symbolic dynamics*]{} is the practice of modelling a\ndynamical system by a space consisting of infinite sequences of abstract\nsymbols, each symbol corresponding to a state of the system, and a shift\noperator corresponding to the dynamics. Symbolic dynamics was first\nintroduced by Emil Artin in 1924, in the study of Artin billiards.\n\nSymbolic dynamics originated as a method to study general dynamical\nsystems, but its techniques and ideas have found significant\napplications in data storage and transmission, linear algebra, the\nmotions of the planets and many other areas. The distinct feature in\nsymbolic dynamics is that time is measured in discrete intervals. So at\neach time interval the system is in a particular state. Each state is\nassociated with a symbol and the evolution of the system is described by\nan infinite sequence of symbols - represented effectively as strings. If\nthe system states are not inherently discrete, then the state vector\nmust be discretized, so as to get a coarse-grained description of the\nsystem.\n\n[*This entry was adapted from the Wikipedia article as of December 19,\n2006.*]{}",
