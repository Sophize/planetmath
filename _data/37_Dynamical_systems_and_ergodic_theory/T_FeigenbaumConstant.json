  "definition": "The *Feigenbaum delta constant* has the value\n\n$$\\delta = 4.669201609102990671853203820466 \\ldots$$\n\nIt governs the structure and behavior of many types of dynamical\nsystems. It was discovered in the 1970s by , while studying the logistic\nmap\n\n$$y'= \\mu \\cdot y (1- y),$$\n\nwhich produces the Feigenbaum tree:\n\n![image](feigen_bifurcate.eps)\n\n[Generated by GNU Octave and GNUPlot.]{}\n\nIf the bifurcations in this tree (first few shown as dotted blue lines)\nare at points $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$, then\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{b_{n}-b_{n-1}}{b_{n+1}-b_{n}} = \\delta.$$\n\nThat is, the ratio of the intervals between the bifurcation points\napproaches Feigenbaum\u2019s constant.\n\nHowever, this is only the beginning. Feigenbaum discovered that this\nconstant arose in *any* dynamical system that approaches chaotic\nbehavior via period-doubling bifurcation, and has a single quadratic\nmaximum. So in some sense, Feigenbaum\u2019s constant is a universal constant\nof chaos theory.\n\nFeigenbaum\u2019s constant appears in problems of fluid-flow turbulence,\nelectronic oscillators, chemical reactions, and even the Mandelbrot set\n(the \u201cbudding\u201d of the Mandelbrot set along the negative real axis occurs\nat intervals determined by Feigenbaum\u2019s constant).\n\n[3]{} , \u201cDecimal expansion of Feigenbaum bifurcation velocity\u201d, in the\n\u201cBifurcations\u201d:",
