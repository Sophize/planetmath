  "statement": "Let $(X, {\\mathfrak{B}}, \\mu)$ be a probability space, $f \\in L^1(\\mu)$,\nand $T\\colon X \\to X$ a measure preserving transformation. Birkhoff\u2019s\n*ergodic theorem* (often called the *pointwise* or *strong* ergodic\ntheorem) states that there exists $f^*\\in L^1(\\mu)$ such that\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(T^k x) = f^*(x)$$ for\nalmost all $x\\in X$. Moreover, $f^*$ is $T$-invariant (i.e.,\n$f^*\\circ T = f^*$) almost everywhere and\n$$\\int f^*d\\mu = \\int f d\\mu.$$ In particular, if $T$ is ergodic then\nthe $T$-invariance of $f^*$ implies that it is constant almost\neverywhere, and so this constant must be the integral of $f^*$; that is,\nif $T$ is ergodic, then\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(T^k x) = \\int fd\\mu$$\nfor almost every $x$. This is often interpreted in the following way:\nfor an ergodic transformation, the time average equals the space average\nalmost surely.",
