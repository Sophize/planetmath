There is a residual subset of\n${\\operatorname{Diff}}^1(M)$ in which every element $f$ satisfies\n$\\overline{{\\operatorname{Per}}(f)}= \\Omega(f)$. In other words:\nGenerically, the set of periodic points of a ${\\mathcal{C}}^1$\ndiffeomorphism is dense in its nonwandering set.\n\nHere, ${\\operatorname{Diff}}^1(M)$ denotes the set of all\n${\\mathcal{C}}^1$ difeomorphisms from $M$ to itself, endowed with the\n(strong) ${\\mathcal{C}}^1$ topology.\n\n[9]{} Pugh, C., *An improved closing lemma and a general density\ntheorem*, Amer.
