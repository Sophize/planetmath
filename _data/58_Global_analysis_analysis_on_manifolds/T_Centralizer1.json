  "definition": "Let $G$ a group acting on itself by conjugation. Let $X$ be a subset of\n$G$. The stabilizer of $X$ is called the *centralizer* of $X$ and it\u2019s\nthe set $$C_G(X)=\\{g\\in G :  gxg^{-1}=x\\quad\\mbox{for all }x\\in X\\}$$\n\nFor any group $G$, $C_G(G)=Z(G)$, the center of $G$. Thus, any subgroup\nof $C_G(G)$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$. However, the converse is\ngenerally not true. For example, take any non-abelian group and pick any\nelement not in the center. Then the subgroup generated by it is\nobviously abelian, clearly non-trivial and not contained in the center.",
