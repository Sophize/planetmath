The Poincar\u00e9 $1$-form play a crucial role in symplectic geometry.\n    The form $d\\alpha$ is the canonical symplectic form for $T^\\ast M$.\n\n2.  Suppose $\\pi\\colon T^\\ast M\\to M$ is the canonical projection. Then\n    $$\\alpha(w) = \\xi( (D\\pi)(w) ),\\quad w\\in T_\\xi(T^\\ast M),$$ which\n    is an alternative definition of $\\alpha$ without local coordinates.\n\n3.  The restriction of this form to the unit cotangent bundle, is a\n    contact form.",
