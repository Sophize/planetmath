  "definition": "Introduction\n------------\n\nLet $p\\colon X\\to B$ be a surjective submersion of $\\mathcal{C}^r$\ndifferential manifolds, where $r\\in\\{0,1,\\ldots\\}\\cup\\{\\infty,\\omega\\}$\n($\\mathcal{C}^\\omega$ means real analytic). For all integers $k\\ge 0$\nwith $k\\le r$, we will define a fibre bundle $\\J^k_B X$ over $X$, called\nthe $k$-th *jet bundle* of $X$ over $B$. The fibre of this bundle above\na point $x\\in\nX$ can be interpreted as the set of equivalence classes of local\nsections of $p$ $x$, where two sections are considered equivalent if\ntheir first $k$ derivatives at $x$ are equal. The equivalence class of a\nsection is then the *jet* of that section; it indicates the direction of\nthe section locally at $x$. This concept has much in common with that of\nthe germ of a smooth function on a manifold: it not only the value of a\nfunction at a point, but also some about the behaviour of the function\nnear that point.\n\nConstruction\n------------\n\nWe will now define each jet bundle of $X$ over $B$ as a set with a\nprojection map to $X$, and we describe the concept of *prolongation* of\nsections. After that, we give a slightly different construction allowing\nus to put a manifold structure on each of the jet bundles.\n\nFor every open subset of $B$, we denote by $\\Gamma(U,X)$ the set of\nsections of $p$ over $U$, i.e.\u00a0the set of ${\\cal C}^r$ functions\n$s\\colon U\\to p^{-1}U$ such that $p\\vert_{p^{-1}U}\\circ s=\\mathop{\\rm\nid}_U$. Every point of $B$ has an open subset $U$ such that there exists\nat least one section of $p$ over $U$, due to the assumption that $p$ is\na surjective submersion. For all $x\\in X$, we define the fibre of\n$\\J^k_BX$ above $x$ by\n$$\\J^k_BX(x)=\\{(U,s)\\colon U\\subset B\\hbox{ open},\nx\\in U,s\\in\\Gamma(U,X),s(p(x))=x\\}/\\mathord\\sim,$$ where the equivalence\nrelation $\\sim$ is defined by $s\\sim\ns'\\Leftrightarrow s$ and $s'$ induce the same map between the fibres at\n$p(x)$ and $x$ of the $k$-th iterated tangent bundles of $B$ and $X$,\nrespectively. (Note that the fibres in the $k$-th iteration are the same\nif and only if the induced maps are already the same in the $(k-1)$-st\niteration). We will denote the equivalence class of a pair $(U,s)$ by\n$[U,s]$. As a set, $\\J^k_BX$ is defined as the disjoint union of the\nsets $\\J^k_BX(x)$ with $x\\in X$. Write $\\pi\\colon\n\\J^k_BX\\to X$ for the \u2018obvious\u2019 projection map, defined by\n$$\\pi([U,s])=x\\hbox{ for }[U,s]\\in\\J^k_BX(x).$$ Notice that $\\J^0_BX$ is\njust $X$ itself.\n\nSuppose we have some section $s$ of $X$ over an open subset $U$ of $B$.\nBy sending every point $y\\in U$ to the equivalence class\n$[U,s]\\in\\J^k_BX(s(y))$ we obtain a section of $\\pi\\circ p\\colon\n\\J^k_BX\\to B$ over $U$ for each $k\\ge 0$, called the $k$-th\n*prolongation* of $s$. Composing this section on the left with $\\pi$\ngives back the original section $s$ of $X$.\n\nThe bundle structure\n--------------------\n\nInstead of defining all the jet bundles at once, we may choose to define\nonly the first jet bundle in the way described above. After equipping\nthe first jet bundle with the structure of a differential manifold,\nwhich we will do below, we can then inductively define $\\J^{k+1}_BX$ as\nthe first jet bundle of $\\J^k_BX$ over $B$ for $k\\ge\n1$. This is useful because the manifold structure only needs to be\ndefined for $\\J^1_BX$. We make $\\J^1_BX$ into an affine bundle over $X$,\nlocally trivial of rank $\\dim B(\\dim X-\\dim B)$, in the following way.\nWe cover $X$ with charts $(W,\\phi,W')$, where $\\phi$ is a diffeomorphism\nbetween open subsets $W\\subset X$ and $W'\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. Without\nloss of generality, we assume that $p(W)$ is contained in the domain $V$\nof a chart $(V,\\psi,V')$ on $B$, with $V'\\subset\\mathbb{R}^m$. Here $n$\nand $m$ are the local dimensions of $X$ and $B$, respectively.\n\nFor all $x\\in W$ and all $[U,s]\\in\\J^1_BX(x)$, we have the tangent map\n$\\T s(p(x))$, which is a linear map from $\\T V(p(x))$ to $\\T W(x)$.\nThese tangent spaces are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$\nvia the chosen charts, so that $\\T s(p(x))$ acts as a matrix\n$M_x([U,s])\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$: $$\\xymatrix{\n\\T W(x) \\ar[r]^\\simeq & \\mathbb{R}^n \\\\\n\\T V(p(x)) \\ar[u]^{\\T s(p(x))} \\ar[r]^\\simeq &\n\\mathbb{R}^m \\ar[u]_{M_x([U,s])}\n}$$ The definition of the equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $\\J^1_BX(x)$\nmeans that the association $[U,s]\\mapsto M_x([U,s])$ is well-defined and\ninjective for each $x\\in W$. The image of $M_x$ consists of the matrices\nwith the property that multiplying them on the left with the $m\\times n$\nmatrix corresponding to the tangent map $\\T p(x)$ gives the $m\\times m$\nidentity matrix. These matrices form a $m(n-m)$-dimensional linear\nsubspace $L_x\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$, and\n$L=\\bigcup_{x\\in W}\\{x\\}\\times L_x$ is a submanifold of\n$W\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$.\n\nWe both the differentiable structure of $\\pi^{-1}U$ and a local\ntrivialisation of $\\J^1_BX$ as a vector bundle by requiring that\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi^{-1}W&\\to&L \\\\\n{}[U,s] &\\mapsto&\\left(\\pi([U,s]),M_{\\pi([U,s])}([U,s])\\right)\\end{aligned}$$\nbe a diffeomorphism and an $\\mathbb{R}$-linear map. Since the effect of\na change of charts on $W$ or $V$ is multiplying each $M_x([U,s])$ by\nmatrices depending differentiably on $x\\in W$ (namely, the derivatives\nof the glueing maps), this gives a well-defined vector bundle structure\non all of $\\J^1_BX$.\n\nIterating the above construction by defining $\\J^{k+1}_BX$ as the first\njet bundle of $\\J^k_BX$ over $B$, each jet bundle $\\J^{k+1}_BX$ becomes\na vector bundle over $\\J^k_BX$ and a fibre bundle over $X$. Normally,\nonly $\\J^1_BX$ is a vector bundle over $X$.",
