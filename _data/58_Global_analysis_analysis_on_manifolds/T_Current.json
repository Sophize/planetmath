  "definition": "Let $\\Lambda_c^m({\\mathbb R}^n)$ denote the space of $C^\\infty$\ndifferentiable $m$-forms with compact support in ${\\mathbb R}^n$. A\ncontinuous linear operator\n$T\\colon \\Lambda_c^m({\\mathbb R}^n)\\to {\\mathbb R}$ is called an\n$m$-*current*. Let $\\mathcal D_m$ denote the space of $m$-currents in\n${\\mathbb R}^n$. We define a boundary operator\n$\\partial\\colon \\mathcal D_{m+1}\\to \\mathcal D_m$ by\n$$\\partial T(\\omega) := T(d\\omega).$$\n\nWe will see that currents represent a generalization of $m$-surfaces. In\nfact if $M$ is a compact $m$-dimensional oriented manifold with\nboundary, we can associate to $M$ the current $[[M]]$ defined by\n$$[[M]](\\omega)=\\int_M \\omega.$$ So the definition of boundary\n$\\partial T$ of a current, is justified by Stokes Theorem:\n$$\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega = \\int_M d\\omega.$$\n\nThe space $\\mathcal D_m$ of $m$-dimensional currents is a real vector\nspace with operations defined by\n$$(T+S)(\\omega):= T(\\omega)+S(\\omega),\\qquad\n   (\\lambda T)(\\omega):=\\lambda T(\\omega).$$ The sum of two currents\nrepresents the *union* of the surfaces they represents. Multiplication\nby a scalar represents a change in the *multiplicity* of the surface. In\nparticular multiplication by $-1$ represents the change of orientation\nof the surface.\n\nWe define the *support* of a current $T$, denoted by $\\mathrm{spt}(T)$,\nthe smallest closed set $C$ such that\n$$T(\\omega)=0\\ \\text{whenever $\\omega=0$ on $C$}.$$ We denote with\n$\\mathcal E_m$ the vector subspace of $\\mathcal D_m$ of currents with\ncompact support.\n\nTopology {#topology .unnumbered}\n========\n\nThe space of currents is naturally endowed with the *weak-star*\ntopology, which will be further simply called *weak convergence*. We say\nthat a sequence $T_k$ of currents, weakly converges to a current $T$ if\n$$T_k(\\omega) \\to T(\\omega),\\qquad \\forall \\omega.$$\n\nA stronger norm on the space of currents is the *mass norm*. First of\nall we define the mass norm of a $m$-form $\\omega$ as\n$$||\\omega||:= \\sup\\{|\\langle \\omega,\\xi\\rangle|\\colon \\text{$\\xi$ is a unit, simple, $m$-vector}\\}.$$\nSo if $\\omega$ is a simple $m$-form, then its mass norm is the usual\nnorm of its coefficient. We hence define the *mass* of a current $T$ as\n$$\\mathbf M (T) := \\sup\\{ T(\\omega)\\colon \\sup_x ||\\omega(x)||\\le 1\\}.$$\nThe mass of a currents represents the *area* of the generalized surface.\n\nAn intermediate norm, is the *flat norm* defined by\n$$\\mathbf F (T) := \\inf \\{\\mathbf M(A) + \\mathbf M(B) \\colon\n    T= A + \\partial B,\\ A\\in\\mathcal E_m,\\ B\\in\\mathcal E_{m+1}\\}.$$\n\nNotice that two currents are close in the mass norm if they coincide\napart from a small part. On the other hand the are close in the flat\nnorm if they coincide up to a small deformation.\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n========\n\nRecall that $\\Lambda_c^0({\\mathbb R}^n)\\equiv C^\\infty_c({\\mathbb R}^n)$\nso that the following defines a $0$-current: $$T(f) = f(0).$$ In\nparticuar every signed measure $\\mu$ with finite mass is a $0$-current:\n$$T(f) = \\int f(x)\\, d\\mu(x).$$\n\nLet $(x,y,z)$ be the coordinates in ${\\mathbb R}^3$. Then the following\ndefines a $2$-current:\n$$T(a\\,dx\\wedge dy + b\\,dy\\wedge dz + c\\,dx\\wedge dz) = \n \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 b(x,y,0)\\, dx \\, dy.$$",
