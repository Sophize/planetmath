  "definition": "[**Overview**]{}\n\nLet $M$ be a differentiable manifold. Analogously to the construction of\nthe tangent bundle, we can make the set of covectors on a given manifold\ninto a vector bundle over $M$, denoted $T^*M$ and called the\n[*cotangent*]{} bundle of $M$.\n\n[**Rigorous Definition**]{}\n\nTo make this definition precise it is convenient to use the . Let $M$ be\nan $n$-dimensional differentiable manifold, let\n$\\{V_\\alpha \\mid \\alpha \\in {\\cal A}\\}$ (each $V_\\alpha$ is an open\nsubset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$) be an atlas of $M$ with transition functions\n$\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}$.\n\nAs an atlas for $T^* (M)$, we may take\n$\\{V_\\alpha \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\alpha \\in {\\cal A}\\}$. We may\nconstruct transition functions ${\\sigma'}_{\\alpha \\beta}$ as follows:\n$$\\bigg({\\sigma'}_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots, x^{2n}) \\bigg)^i = \\bigg(\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots, x^n) \\bigg)^i \\qquad 1 \\le i \\le n$$\n$$\\bigg({\\sigma'}_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots, x^{2n}) \\bigg)^{i+n} = \\sum_{j = 1}^n {\\partial \\bigg(\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots, x^n) \\bigg)^i \\over \\partial x^j} x^{j+n} \\qquad 1 \\le i \\le n$$\nFor these to be valid transition functions, they must satisfy the three\ncriteria. For a verification that these criteria are satisfied, please\nsee the attachment.\n\n[**Bundle Structure**]{}\n\nThe cotangent bundle is a $GL(n)$ vector bundle over the manifold $M$.\nTo substantiate this claim, we must specify a projection map onto the\nmanifold $M$ and local trivializations and transition functions and\nverify that they satisfies the defining properties of a bundle. In terms\nof the local coordinates used above, it is easy to describe the\nprojection map $\\pi$: $${\\pi (x^1, \\ldots, x^{2n})}^i = x^i$$ The local\ntrivializations are also somewhat trivial:\n$${\\phi_\\alpha (x^1, \\ldots, x^{2n})} = x^{i+n}$$ Finally, the\ntransition functions are given as follows:\n$$g_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots, x^{2n})^i_j = {\\partial \\big( \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta} (x^1, \\ldots x^n) \\big)^i \\over \\partial x^j}$$\n\nFor a verification that $( T^* M, \\pi, \\phi_\\alpha, g_{\\alpha \\beta} )$\nsatisfies the three criteria for a bundle, please see the attachment.\n\n[**Properties**]{}\n\nThe cotangent bundle $T^*M$ is the vector bundle dual to the tangent\nbundle $TM$. On any differentiable manifold, $T^*M \\cong TM$ (for\nexample, by the existence of a Riemannian metric), but this\nidentification is by no means canonical, and thus it is useful to\ndistinguish between these two objects.\n\nThe cotangent bundle to any manifold has a natural symplectic structure\ngiven in terms of the Poincar\u00e9 1-form, which is in some sense unique.\nThis is not true of the tangent bundle. The existence of a symplectic\nstructure implies that the cotangent bundle is always orientable, even\nif the original manifold is not.",
