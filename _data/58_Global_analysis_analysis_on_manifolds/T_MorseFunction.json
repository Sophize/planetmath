  "definition": "Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A critical point of a map\n$u:M\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$ at $x\\in M$ is called if the Hessian matrix $H_u$\n(in any local coordinate system) at $x$ is non-degenerate.\n\nA smooth function $u:M\\to{\\mathbb{R}}$ is called [*Morse*]{} if all its\ncritical points are non-degenerate. Morse functions exist on any smooth\nmanifold, and in fact form an open subset of smooth functions on $M$\n(this fact is often phrased \u201ca generic smooth function is Morse\u201d).",
