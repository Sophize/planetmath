  "definition": "#### Summary.\n\nThe [*gradient*]{} is a first-order differential operator that maps\nscalar functions to vector fields. It is a generalization of the\nordinary derivative, and as such conveys information about the rate of\nchange of a function relative to small variations in the independent\nvariables. The gradient of a function $f$ is customarily denoted by\n$\\nabla f$ or by ${\\operatorname{grad}}f$.\n\nDefinition: Euclidean space\n===========================\n\nLet $f\\colon {\\mathbb{R}}^n \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be continuously\ndifferentiable. The [*gradient*]{} of $f$, denoted by $\\nabla f$, is\ndefined by the property: $$\\label{inner-prod-def}\n\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}f = \\nabla f \\cdot {\\mathbf{v}}\\quad \\text{for all vectors ${\\mathbf{v}}\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$.}$$\nThe middle dot is the dot product, and $\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}$\nis the directional derivative with respect to ${\\mathbf{v}}$.\n\nIf $x^1, \\dotsc, x^n$ are Euclidean coordinates, corresponding to the\northonormal basis ${\\mathbf{e}}_1, \\dotsc, {\\mathbf{e}}_n$, then\n$$\\label{euclidean-def}\n\\nabla f = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i}\\, {\\mathbf{e}}_i\\,.$$\nThe formula is sometimes given as the definition of $\\nabla f$. We\nprefer to define $\\nabla f$ by the coordinate-free formula instead,\nbecause then the geometric interpretations (see below) become obvious,\nand also indicates how we would go about calculating the gradient in\nother curvilinear coordinate systems. Formula also makes it clear that\nthe gradient is a physical vector, depending only on the inner product\nstructure of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$, and not on the specific coordinate system\nused to calculate it.\n\nThere is the issue of whether the $\\nabla f$ as defined by exists; but\nthis is proved easily enough, by substituting the concrete expression\nand seeing that it satisfies .\n\nThe gradient can be considered to be a vector-valued differential\noperator, written as\n$$\\nabla = \\sum_{i=1}^n {\\mathbf{e}}_i \\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\,,$$\nor, in the context of Euclidean 3-space, as\n$$\\nabla = {\\mathbf{i}}\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} +{\\mathbf{j}}\\,\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} +{\\mathbf{k}}\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\,,$$\nwhere ${\\mathbf{i}}, {\\mathbf{j}}, {\\mathbf{k}}$ are the unit vectors\nlying along the positive direction of the $x, y, z$ axes, respectively.\n\nGeometric and physical interpretations\n======================================\n\n(a) The direction of the vector $\\nabla f$ is the direction of the\n    greatest positive change, or increase, in $f$. The magnitude of\n    $\\nabla f$ is the magnitude of this increase. This follows\n    immediately from :\n    $$\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}f = \\nabla f \\cdot {\\mathbf{v}}= {\\lVert\\nabla f\\rVert} \\, {\\lVert{\\mathbf{v}}\\rVert} \\, \\cos \\theta\\,,$$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\nabla f$ and ${\\mathbf{v}}$.\n    So among all unit directions ${\\mathbf{v}}$ of change, if\n    ${\\mathbf{v}}$ is perpendicular to $\\nabla f$ then the change\n    $\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}f$ is zero; if ${\\mathbf{v}}$ is\n    parallel to $\\nabla f$ then the change is maximized.\n\n    Similarly, $-\\nabla f$ is the direction of the greatest negative\n    change, or decrease, in $f$.\n\n(b) If $M$ is the hypersurface in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ defined by\n    $$M = \\{ p \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n : f(p) = 0 \\,, \\: \\operatorname{D}f(p) \\neq 0 \\}\\,,$$\n    then $\\nabla f(p)$ is the normal to the hypersurface $M$ at the\n    point $p$. For $\\ker \\operatorname{D}f(p)$ is the tangent space\n    $\\mathrm{T}_p M$ to $M$ at $p$, that is,\n    $\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}f(p) = 0$ for all\n    ${\\mathbf{v}}\\in \\mathrm{T}_p M$, and by definition , $\\nabla f(p)$\n    must be perpendicular to all ${\\mathbf{v}}\\in \\mathrm{T}_p M$.\n\n    Note that $\\operatorname{D}f \\neq 0$ is equivalent to\n    $\\nabla f \\neq 0$. Consequently, $\\nabla f$ also gives an\n    orientation to the hypersurface $M$.\n\n    For example, if $f({\\mathbf{x}}) = {\\lVert{\\mathbf{x}}\\rVert} - 1$\n    for ${\\mathbf{x}}\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^n$, $M$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional\n    sphere of unit radius, embedded in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$. Its normal,\n    $\\nabla f({\\mathbf{x}}) = {\\mathbf{x}}/{\\lVert{\\mathbf{x}}\\rVert}$,\n    as one would expect, points outward radially.\n\n(c) As a simple case of (b), consider the surface $z = f(x, y)$ in\n    ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. Think of\n    this surface as describing a hill, with height $z$. Then the\n    direction of the gradient vector $\\nabla f$ is the direction of\n    steepest ascent of the hill, while its magnitude\n    $$\\Vert \\nabla f \\Vert = \\sqrt{ {\\left(}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\n    {\\right)}^2 + {\\left(}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} {\\right)}^2 }$$\n    is the slope or steepness in that direction.\n\n    If a ball is placed on the hill at a point $(x, y, z)$,\n    theoretically it should roll down the hill in the direction of the\n    gradient vector $-\\nabla f(x, y)$. This may be easily derived by\n    considering the mechanical forces on the ball. The direction of\n    $-\\nabla f(x, y)$ is, in fact, the projection to the xy-plane of an\n    outward normal vector to the hill at $(x, y, z)$; the normal vector\n    is involved because the movement of the ball arises from the normal\n    force from the hill.\n\n(d) Suppose the surface $z = f(x, y)$ in (c) describes a bowl instead of\n    a hill, and we place a marble at any point $(x, y, z)$ on this bowl.\n    We would expect the marble to roll down to a local minimum point of\n    $f(x, y)$. Since the marble should roll down in the direction of\n    $-\\nabla f$, we might hope that we can *find* local minima of a\n    *given function* $f$ by following the path mapped out by the\n    gradients $-\\nabla f$. Formally, this method of finding local\n    extrema (with some modifications) is called [*gradient descent*]{}.\n\n(e) If $U$ is the potential function corresponding to a conservative\n    physical force, then ${\\mathbf{F}}= -\\nabla U$ is the corresponding\n    force field.\n\n    Consequently, the gradient theorem,\n    $$\\int_\\gamma {\\mathbf{F}}\\cdot d{\\mathbf{s}}= -\\int_\\gamma \\nabla U \\cdot d{\\mathbf{s}}= -U(\\gamma(b)) + U(\\gamma(a)), \\quad \\gamma\\colon [a, b] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^3$$\n    simply gives the formula for the change in the potential energy $U$\n    when an object \u201cdoes work\u201d along a path $\\gamma$ in a conservative\n    force field ${\\mathbf{F}}$.\n\nDefinition: Riemannian geometry\n===============================\n\nIt is obvious how can be generalized to the setting of Riemannian\nmanifolds: the dot product of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ must be replaced by the\nRiemannian metric, and the analogue of $\\operatorname{D}_{\\mathbf{v}}f$\nis the directional derivative ${\\mathbf{v}}[f]$, for tangent vectors\n${\\mathbf{v}}$ on the Riemannian manifold. Thus for a smooth\nscalar-valued function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold,\n$$\\label{eq:riemann-def}\n{\\mathbf{X}}= {\\operatorname{grad}}f  \\: \\Leftrightarrow \\: df_p({\\mathbf{v}}) = {\\mathbf{v}}[f] = \\langle {\\mathbf{X}}, {\\mathbf{v}}\\rangle_p\\,.$$\nWe can calculate ${\\mathbf{X}}$ explicitly as follows. If $x^i$ are\nlocal coordinates on the manifold (not necessarily orthonormal), set\n${\\mathbf{X}}= X^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ (the Einstein\nsummation convention is being used). Let $ g_{ij}$ and $ g^{ij}$ be the\ncovariant and contravariant metric tensors, respectively. Then from ,\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j} = \\left\\langle X^i \n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\right\\rangle\n= X^i \\, \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\right\\rangle \n=  g_{ij} \\, X^i\\,,$$ and taking inverses, $$\\label{eq:gendef}\nX^i = g^{ij} \\, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}\\,.$$\n\nDuality with differential one-forms\n===================================\n\nDefinitions and exhibit $\\nabla f$ as the vector field dual to the\ndifferential form $df$. The isomorphism is given by applying the inner\nproduct or Riemannian metric. This isomorphism is, of course, linear; in\nparticular it leads to the identity $$\\label{eq:linearity}\n\\nabla f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} \\, \\nabla x^i\\,,$$ which is\nthe dual to the standard formula of differential one-forms:\n$$df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} \\, dx^i \\,.$$ Using and , we have\n$$\\label{eq:grad-coord}\n\\nabla x^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\,, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} = g_{ij} \\nabla x^j\\,.$$ So the\nisomorphism between vector fields and one-forms is expressed by changing\nthe $\\nabla$\u2019s in to $d$\u2019s, and vice versa. That is,\n$$d x^i \\leftrightarrow g^{ij}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\,, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\leftrightarrow g_{ij} \\, d x^j\\,.$$ It is\ncommonly said that this isomorphism is expressed by \u201craising and\nlowering the indices of a tensor field, using contractions with $g_{ij}$\nand $g^{ij}$\u201d.\n\nNotice that when $x^i$ are orthonormal coordinates on ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$,\nequation reduces to equation , because\n$g_{ij} = {\\mathbf{e}}_i \\cdot {\\mathbf{e}}_j = \\delta_{ij}$ (Kronecker\ndelta).\n\nThe formulae presented in this section are useful in the Euclidean\nsetting as well, for deriving the formulae for the .\n\nDifferential identities\n=======================\n\nSeveral properties of the one-dimensional derivative generalize to a\nmulti-dimensional setting $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla(af+bg) &= a\\nabla f + b\\nabla g & \\text{Linearity}\\\\\n\\nabla(fg) &= f\\nabla g + g\\nabla f & \\text{Product rule}\\\\\n\\nabla( f \\circ \\phi ) (p) &= \\operatorname{D}\\phi(p)^* \\nabla f(\\phi(p)) & \\text{Chain rule} \\\\\n\\nabla(h \\circ f)(p) &= h'(f(p)) \\, \\nabla f(p) & \\text{Another Chain rule} \\end{aligned}$$\nThe function $h$ is $h\\colon {\\mathbb{R}}\\to {\\mathbb{R}}$. The notation\n$(\\operatorname{D}\\phi)^*$ denotes the transpose of the Jacobian matrix,\nin Euclidean coordinates, of\n$\\phi \\colon {\\mathbb{R}}^m \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$. In the abstract\nsetting, $(\\operatorname{D}\\phi)^*$ is the adjoint to the tangent map\n$\\operatorname{D}\\phi$ between the tangent bundles of two Riemannian\nmanifolds.\n\nThese identities can be proved directly from the definition, but the\nfirst three are really just the duals of the following well-known\nidentities for differential forms: $$\\begin{aligned}\nd(af + bg) &= a df + b dg \\\\\nd(fg) &= f dg + g df \\\\\nd(\\phi^* f) &= \\phi^* df\\end{aligned}$$ and so may be derived by\nchanging the $d$\u2019s here to $\\nabla$\u2019s! (Though the third identity may\ntake a bit of thought.)\n\nThe following identity\n$${\\operatorname{curl}}{\\operatorname{grad}}f = \\nabla \\times \\nabla f = 0\\,,$$\nis a special case of the differential forms identity $d^2 = 0$.\nConversely, if ${\\operatorname{curl}}g = 0$ on a simply connected\ndomain, then there is $f$ such that $g = {\\operatorname{grad}}f$. See\nlaminar field for details.\n\nThe $\\nabla$ symbolism\n======================\n\n(This discussion does not really belong here, but should be moved to the\nnabla entry.)\n\nUsing the $\\nabla$ formalism, the divergence operator can be expressed\nas $\\nabla\\cdot$, the curl operator as $\\nabla\\times$, and the Laplacian\noperator as $\\nabla^2$. To wit, for a given vector field\n$${\\mathbf{A}}= A_x\\, {\\mathbf{i}}+ A_y\\, {\\mathbf{j}}+ A_z\\, {\\mathbf{k}},$$\nand a given function $f$ we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla\\cdot {\\mathbf{A}}&= \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial x} +\n\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial y} +\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial z} \\\\\n\\nabla\\times {\\mathbf{A}}&=\n{\\left(}\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z}\n{\\right)}{\\mathbf{i}}+\n{\\left(}\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial z} -\n\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial x}{\\right)}{\\mathbf{j}}+\n{\\left(}\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} -\n\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y}{\\right)}{\\mathbf{k}}\\\\\n\\nabla^2 f &= \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} +\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} +\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n[3]{} Michael Spivak. *A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential\nGeometry*, Volume I.
