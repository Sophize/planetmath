  "definition": "In this entry we construct the *free vector space over a set*, or the\n*vector space generated by a set* [@greub]. For a set $X$, we shall\ndenote this vector space by $C(X)$. One application of this construction\nis given in [@madsen], where the free vector space is used to define the\ntensor product for modules.\n\nTo define the vector space $C(X)$, let us first define $C(X)$ as a set.\nFor a set $X$ and a field ${\\mathbb{K}}$, we define $$\\begin{aligned}\nC(X) &=& \\{ f:X\\to {\\mathbb{K}}\\,\\, |\\,\\, f^{-1}({\\mathbb{K}}\\backslash\\{0\\}) \\, \\mbox{is finite} \\}.\\end{aligned}$$\nIn other words, $C(X)$ consists of functions $f:X\\to {\\mathbb{K}}$ that\nare non-zero only at finitely many points in $X$. Here, we denote the\nidentity element in ${\\mathbb{K}}$ by $1$, and the zero element by $0$.\nThe vector space structure for $C(X)$ is defined as follows. If $f$ and\n$g$ are functions in $C(X)$, then $f+g$ is the mapping\n$x\\mapsto f(x) + g(x)$. Similarly, if $f\\in C(X)$ and\n$\\alpha \\in {\\mathbb{K}}$, then $\\alpha f$ is the mapping\n$x\\mapsto \\alpha f(x)$. It is not difficult to see that these operations\nare well defined, i.e., both $f+g$ and $\\alpha f$ are again functions in\n$C(X)$.\n\n### Basis for $C(X)$\n\nIf $a\\in X$, let us define the function $\\Delta_a \\in C(X)$ by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta_a(x)&=& \\left\\{ \\begin {array}{ll} \n  1 & \\mbox{when} \\, x=a, \\\\\n  0 & \\mbox{otherwise.} \\\\\n  \\end{array} \\right.\\end{aligned}$$ These functions form a linearly\nindependent basis for $C(X)$, i.e., $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{basiseq}\nC(X) &=& {\\mathop{\\mathrm{span}}}\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}.\\end{aligned}$$\nHere, the space ${\\mathop{\\mathrm{span}}}\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$\nconsists of all finite linear combinations of elements in\n$\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$. It is clear that any element in\n${\\mathop{\\mathrm{span}}}\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$ is a member in $C(X)$.\nLet us check the other direction. Suppose $f$ is a member in $C(X)$.\nThen, let $\\xi_1, \\ldots,\u00c2\u00a0\\xi_N$ be the distinct points in $X$ where\n$f$ is non-zero. We then have $$\\begin{aligned}\nf&=&\\sum_{i=1}^Nf(\\xi_i) \\Delta_{\\xi_i},\\end{aligned}$$ and we have\nestablished equality in equation \\[basiseq\\].\n\nTo see that the set $\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$ is linearly independent, we\nneed to show that its any finite subset is linearly independent. Let\n$\\{ \\Delta_{\\xi_1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{\\xi_N} \\}$ be such a finite subset,\nand suppose $\\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i \\Delta_{\\xi_i }=0$ for some\n$\\alpha_i \\in {\\mathbb{K}}$. Since the points $\\xi_i$ are pairwise\ndistinct, it follows that $\\alpha_i=0$ for all $i$. This shows that the\nset $\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$ is linearly independent.\n\nLet us define the mapping $\\iota:X\\to C(X)$, $x\\mapsto \\Delta_x$. This\nmapping gives a bijection between $X$ and the basis vectors\n$\\{ \\Delta_a\\}_{a\\in X}$. We can thus identify these spaces. Then $X$\nbecomes a linearly independent basis for $C(X)$.\n\n### Universal property of $\\iota:X\\to C(X)$\n\nThe mapping $\\iota:X\\to C(X)$ is universal in the following sense. If\n$\\phi$ is an arbitrary mapping from $X$ to a vector space $V$, then\nthere exists a unique mapping $\\bar{\\phi}$ such that the below diagram\ncommutes: $$\\xymatrix{\nX \\ar[r]^\\phi\\ar[d]_\\iota & V \\\\\nC(X) \\ar[ur]_{\\bar{\\phi}} &\n}$$ *Proof.* We define $\\bar{\\phi}$ as the linear mapping that maps the\nbasis elements of $C(X)$ as $\\bar{\\phi}(\\Delta_x) = \\phi(x)$. Then, by\ndefinition, $\\bar{\\phi}$ is linear. For uniqueness, suppose that there\nare linear mappings $\\bar{\\phi},\\bar{\\sigma}:C(X)\\to V$ such that\n$\\phi=\\bar{\\phi}\\circ \\iota =\\bar{\\sigma}\\circ \\iota$. For all $x\\in X$,\nwe then have $\\bar{\\phi}(\\Delta_x)=\\bar{\\sigma}(\\Delta_x)$. Thus\n$\\bar{\\phi}=\\bar{\\sigma}$ since both mappings are linear and the\ncoincide on the basis elements.$\\Box$\n\n[9]{} W. Greub, *Linear Algebra*, Springer-Verlag, Fourth edition, 1975.\nI.
