  "statement": "([@prasolov], pp. 82) A square matrix is diagonal if and only if it is\nnormal and triangular.\n\n*Proof.* If $A$ is a diagonal matrix, then the complex conjugate\n$A^\\ast$ is also a diagonal matrix. Since arbitrary diagonal matrices\ncommute, it follows that $A^\\ast A = A A^\\ast$. Thus any diagonal matrix\nis a normal triangular matrix.\n\nNext, suppose $A=(a_{ij})$ is a normal upper triangular matrix. Thus\n$a_{ij}=0$ for $i>j$, so for the diagonal elements in $A^\\ast A$ and\n$AA^\\ast$, we obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n(A^\\ast A)_{ii} &=& \\sum_{k=1}^i |a_{ki}|^2, \\\\\n(AA^\\ast)_{ii} &=& \\sum_{k=i}^n |a_{ik}|^2. \\\\\\end{aligned}$$ For $i=1$,\nwe have $$|a_{11}|^2 = |a_{11}|^2+|a_{12}|^2+\\cdots + |a_{1n}|^2.$$ It\nfollows that the only non-zero entry on the first row of $A$ is\n$a_{11}$. Similarly, for $i=2$, we obtain\n$$|a_{12}|^2 + |a_{22}|^2 = |a_{22}|^2+\\cdots + |a_{2n}|^2.$$ Since\n$a_{12}=0$, it follows that the only non-zero element on the second row\nis $a_{22}$. Repeating this for all rows, we see that $A$ is a diagonal\nmatrix. Thus any normal upper triangular matrix is a diagonal matrix.\n\nSuppose then that $A$ is a normal lower triangular matrix. Then it is\nnot difficult to see that $A^\\ast$ is a normal upper triangular matrix.\nThus, by the above, $A^\\ast$ is a diagonal matrix, whence also $A$ is a\ndiagonal matrix. $\\Box$\n\n[9]{} V.V.
