  "definition": "A [*skew-symmetric*]{} (or [*antisymmetric*]{}) [*bilinear form*]{} is a\nspecial case of a bilinear form $B$, namely one which is skew-symmetric\nin the two coordinates; that is, $B(x,y) = -B(y,x)$ for all vectors $x$\nand $y$. Note that this definition only makes sense if $B$ is defined\nover two identical vector spaces, so we must require this in the formal\ndefinition:\n\na bilinear form $B: V \\times V \\rightarrow K$ ($V$ a vector space over a\nfield $K$) is called [*skew-symmetric*]{} iff\n\n> $B(x,y) = -B(y,x)$ for all vectors $x, y \\in V$.\n\nSuppose that the characteristic of $K$ is not $2$. Set $x=y$ in the\nabove equation. Then $B(x,x)=-B(x,x)$ for all vectors $x \\in V$, which\nmeans that $2B(x,x)=0$, or $B(x,x)=0$. Therefore, $B$ is an alternating\nform.\n\nIf, however, $\\operatorname{char}(K)=2$, then $B(x,y)=-B(y,x)=B(y,x)$;\n$B$ is a symmetric bilinear form.\n\nIf $V$ is finite-dimensional, then every bilinear form on $V$ can be\nrepresented by a matrix. In this case the following theorem applies:\n\nA bilinear form is skew-symmetric iff its representing matrix is\nskew-symmetric. (The fact that the representing matrix is skew-symmetric\nis independent of the choice of representing matrix).",
