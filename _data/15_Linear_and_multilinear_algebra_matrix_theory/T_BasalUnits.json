  "definition": "The set of all $n\\!\\times\\!n$ matrices over a skew field forms an\n$n^2$-dimensional associative algebra, for the basis of which one can\ntake the *basal units*. A basal unit of the algebra has all components\nzeroes except only one which is 1.\\\nE.g. $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix}$$ is a basal unit of the algebra of $3\\!\\times\\!3$\nmatrices.\n\n[8]{} : [*Algebras and their arithmetics*]{}.
