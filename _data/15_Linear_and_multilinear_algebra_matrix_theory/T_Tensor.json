  "definition": "#### Overview\n\nA *tensor* is the mathematical idealization of a geometric or physical\nquantity whose analytic description, relative to a fixed frame of\nreference, consists of an array of numbers[^1]. Some well known examples\nof tensors in geometry are quadratic forms, and the curvature tensor.\nExamples of physical tensors are the energy-momentum tensor, and the\npolarization tensor.\n\nGeometric and physical quantities may be categorized by considering the\ndegrees of freedom inherent in their description. The scalar quantities\nare those that can be represented by a single number \u2014 speed, mass,\ntemperature, for example. There are also vector-like quantities, such as\nforce, that require a list of numbers for their description. Finally,\nquantities such as quadratic forms naturally require a multiply indexed\narray for their description. These latter quantities can only be\nconceived of as *tensors*.\n\nActually, the tensor notion is quite general, and applies to all of the\nabove examples; scalars and vectors are special kinds of tensors. The\nfeature that distinguishes a scalar from a vector, and distinguishes\nboth of those from a more general tensor quantity is the number of\nindices in the representing array. This number is called the *rank* of a\ntensor. Thus, scalars are rank zero tensors (no indices at all), and\nvectors are rank one tensors.\n\nIt is also necessary to distinguish between two types of indices,\ndepending on whether the corresponding numbers transform covariantly or\ncontravariantly relative to a change in the frame of reference.\n*Contravariant indices* are written as superscripts, while the\n*covariant indices* are written as subscripts. The *valence* of a tensor\nis the pair $(p,q)$, where $p$ is the number contravariant and $q$ the\nnumber of covariant indices, respectively.\n\nIt is customary to represent the actual tensor, as a stand-alone entity,\nby a bold-face symbol such as ${\\mathsf{A}}$. The corresponding array of\nnumbers for a type $(p,q)$ tensor is denoted by the symbol\n$A^{i_1\\ldots i_p}_{j_1\\ldots j_q},$ where the superscripts and\nsubscripts are indices that vary from $1$ to $n$. This number $n$, the\nrange of the indices, is called the dimension of the tensor. The total\ndegrees of freedom required for the specification of a particular tensor\nis the product of the tensor\u2019s rank and its dimension.\n\nAgain, it must be emphasized that the tensor ${\\mathsf{A}}$ and the\nrepresenting array $A^{i_1\\ldots i_q}_{j_1\\ldots j_p}$ are not the same\nthing. The values of the representing array are given relative to some\nframe of reference, and undergo a linear transformation when the frame\nis changed.\n\nFinally, it must be mentioned that most physical and geometric\napplications are concerned with *tensor fields*, that is to say tensor\nvalued functions, rather than tensors themselves. Some care is required,\nbecause it is common to see a tensor field called simply a tensor. There\nis a difference, however; the entries of a tensor array\n$A^{i_1\\ldots i_q}_{j_1\\ldots j_p}$ are numbers, whereas the entries of\na tensor field are functions. The present entry treats the purely\nalgebraic aspect of tensors. Tensor field concepts, which typically\ninvolved derivatives of some kind, are discussed elsewhere.\n\n#### Definition.\n\nThe formal definition of a tensor quantity begins with a\nfinite-dimensional vector space ${U}$, which furnishes the uniform\n\u201cbuilding blocks\u201d for tensors of all valences. In typical applications,\n${U}$ is the tangent space at a point of a manifold; the elements of\n${U}$ represent velocities and forces. The space of $(p,q)$-valent\ntensors, denoted here by ${\\mathcal{T}}_{p,q}({U})$ is obtained by\ntaking the tensor product of $p$ copies of ${U}$, and $q$ copies of the\ndual vector space ${U}^*$. To wit,\n$${\\mathcal{T}}_{p,q}({U}) = \\overbrace{{U}\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes{U}}^{p\\text{\n    times}}\n\\otimes\n\\overbrace{{U}^*\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes{U}^*}^{q\\text{ times}}.$$\n\nIn order to represent a tensor by a concrete array of numbers, we\nrequire a frame of reference, which is essentially a basis of ${U}$, say\n${e}_1,\\ldots,{e}_n \\in {U}.$ Every vector in ${U}$ can be \u201cmeasured\u201d\nrelative to this basis, meaning that for every ${\\mathbf{v}}\\in{U}$\nthere exist unique scalars $v^i$, such that (note the use of the\nEinstein summation convention) $${\\mathbf{v}}= v^i{e}_i.$$ These scalars\nare called the components of ${\\mathbf{v}}$ relative to the frame in\nquestion.\n\nLet ${\\varepsilon}^1,\\ldots,{\\varepsilon}^n\\in{U}^*$ be the\ncorresponding dual basis, i.e., $${\\varepsilon}^i({e}_j) = \\delta^i_j,$$\nwhere the latter is the Kronecker delta array. For every covector\n${\\alpha}\\in{U}^*$ there exists a unique array of components $\\alpha_i$\nsuch that $${\\alpha}= \\alpha_i\\, {\\varepsilon}^i.$$\n\nMore generally, every tensor ${\\mathsf{A}}\\in{\\mathcal{T}}_{p,q}({U})$\nhas a unique description in terms of components. That is to say, there\nexists a unique array of scalars $A^{i_1\\ldots i_q}_{j_1\\ldots j_p}$\nsuch that\n$${\\mathsf{A}}= A^{i_1\\ldots i_q}_{j_1\\ldots j_p}\\, {e}_{i_1} \\otimes\n\\ldots\\otimes {e}_{i_q} \\otimes {\\varepsilon}^{j_1}\\otimes\\ldots\\otimes {\\varepsilon}^{j_p}.$$\n\n#### Transformation rule.\n\nNext, suppose that a change is made to a different frame of reference,\nsay ${\\hat{{e}}}_1,\\ldots,{\\hat{{e}}}_n\\in{U}.$ Any two frames are\nuniquely related by an invertible transition matrix $X^i_{\\,j}$, having\nthe property that for all values of $j$ we have $$\\label{eq:frametran}\n  {\\hat{{e}}}_j = X^i_{\\,j}\\, {e}_i.$$ Let ${\\mathbf{v}}\\in{U}$ be a\nvector, and let $v^i$ and ${\\hat{v}}^i$ denote the corresponding\ncomponent arrays relative to the two frames. From\n$${\\mathbf{v}}= v^i{e}_i = {\\hat{v}}^i{\\hat{{e}}}_i,$$ and from we infer\nthat $$\\label{eq:vectran}\n  {\\hat{v}}^i = Y^i_{\\,j}\\, v^j,$$ where $Y^i_{\\,j}$ is the matrix\ninverse of $X^i_{\\,j}$, i.e., $$X^i_{\\,k} Y^k_{\\,j } = \\delta^i_{\\,j}.$$\nThus, the transformation rule for a vector\u2019s components is contravariant\nto the transformation rule for the frame of reference . It is for this\nreason that the superscript indices of a vector are called\ncontravariant.\n\nTo establish , we note that the transformation rule for the dual basis\ntakes the form\n$${\\hat{{\\varepsilon}}}^i = Y^i_{\\,j}\\, {\\varepsilon}^j,$$ and that\n$$v^i = {\\varepsilon}^i({\\mathbf{v}}),$$ while\n$${\\hat{v}}^i = {\\hat{{\\varepsilon}}}^i({\\mathbf{v}}).$$\n\nThe transformation rule for covector components is covariant. Let\n${\\alpha}\\in {U}^*$ be a given covector, and let $\\alpha_i$ and\n${\\hat{\\alpha}}_i$ be the corresponding component arrays. Then\n$${\\hat{\\alpha}}_j = X^i_{\\,j}\\, \\alpha_i.$$ The above relation is\neasily established. We need only remark that\n$$\\alpha_i = {\\alpha}({e}_i),$$ and that\n$${\\hat{\\alpha}}_j = {\\alpha}({\\hat{{e}}}_j),$$ and then use .\n\nIn light of the above discussion, we see that the transformation rule\nfor a general type $(p,q)$ tensor takes the form\n$${\\hat{A}}^{i_1\\ldots i_q}_{\\,j_1\\ldots j_p} =\nX^{i_1}_{\\,k_1}\\cdots X^{i_q}_{\\,k_q}\nY^{l_1}_{\\,j_1}\\cdots Y^{l_1}_{\\,j_p}\nA^{k_1\\ldots k_q}_{\\,l_1\\ldots l_p}.$$\n\n[^1]: as Rene Magritte put it. The image and the object represented by\n    the image are not the same thing. The mass of a stone is not a\n    number. Rather the mass can be described by a number relative to\n    some specified unit mass.",
