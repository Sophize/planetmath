  "statement": "**Proposition**. Let $k$ be a field and $V$, $W$ be vector spaces over\n$k$. Then $(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ is isomorphic to $V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$.\n\n*Proof*. If $V$ or $W$ is finite dimensional, then there is an explicit\nisomorphism between $(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ and $V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$ (see for\nmore details). So assume that both $V$ and $W$ are infinite\ndimensional.\\\nFirst of all, note that if $V$ is a vector space, then\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)$ denotes its dimension, that is\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)$ is a cardinality of any basis of $V$. Thus we can\ncompare dimensions of spaces, so\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ if and only if there is an\ninjection from a basis of $V$ to a basis of $W$ (note that this relation\nis well defined, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of bases). One\ncan easily show that $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ if and\nonly if there is an injective linear map from $V$ to $W$ and this is if\nand only if there is a surjective linear map from $W$ to $V$. Therefore\n$V$ is isomorphic to $W$ if and only if\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)=\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ (which here means that\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ and\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)$).\\\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that\n$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ (we can always compare any\ntwo sets). Note that the basis of $V\\otimes W$ is the product of bases\nof $V$ and $W$ (namely if $(e_i)_{i\\in I}$ is a basis of $V$ and\n$(e'_{j})_{j\\in J}$ a basis of $W$, then\n$(e_{i}\\otimes e'_{j})_{i\\in I,j\\in J}$ is a basis of $V\\otimes W$). If\n$X,Y$ are sets such that $Y$ is infinite and there is an injection\n$X\\to Y$, then it is well known that there is a bijection from $Y$ to\n$X\\times Y$. Thus (since $W$ is infinite dimensional) we have:\n$$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V\\otimes W)=\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W).$$ Therefore\n$V\\otimes W$ is isomorphic to $W$, so $(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ is isomorphic\nto $W^{*}$.\n\nNow the inequality $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V)\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W)$ implies\nthat $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V^{*})\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W^{*})$. Indeed,\nassume that there is an injective linear map $f:V\\to W$. Then there is a\n(surjective) linear map $g:W\\to V$ such that $g\\circ f =\\mathrm{id}_{V}$\n(see for more details). Therefore (since $(\\cdot)^{*}$ is a\ncontravariant functor) we have that\n$$\\mathrm{id}_{V^{*}}=(\\mathrm{id}_{V})^{*}=(g\\circ f)^{*}=f^{*}\\circ g^{*}$$\nand this implies that $f^{*}:W^{*}\\to V^{*}$ is a surjective linear map\n(on the other hand $g^{*}:V^{*}\\to W^{*}$ is an injective linear map),\nso $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V^{*})\\leq\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W^{*})$.\n\nNow (due to previous arguments) we have\n$$\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(V^{*}\\otimes W^{*})=\\mathrm{dim}_{k}(W^{*}),$$ so\n$V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$ and $W^{*}$ are isomorphic.\n\nAll in all, we have that $(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ is isomorphic to $W^{*}$,\nwhich is isomorphic to $V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$. This completes the proof.\n$\\square$\n\n**Remarks**. We know that there is an isomorphism between\n$(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ and $V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$, but generally we know\nnothing about it, about its behaviour. Thus it is hard to find\nimprortant applications for this proposition. Also note, that this\nproposition is true for free modules over any unital ring.",
