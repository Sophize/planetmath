  "statement": "The sum of the rank and the nullity of a linear mapping gives the\ndimension of the mapping\u2019s domain. More precisely, let\n$T:V\\rightarrow W$ be a linear mapping. If $V$ is a finite-dimensional,\nthen\n$$\\dim V = \\dim \\mathop{\\mathrm{Ker}} T + \\dim \\mathop{\\mathrm{Img}}\nT.$$\n\nThe intuitive content of the Rank-Nullity theorem is the principle that\n\n> *Every independent linear constraint takes away one degree of\n> freedom.*\n\nThe rank is just the number of independent linear constraints on $v\\in\nV$ imposed by the equation $$T(v)=0.$$ The dimension of $V$ is the\nnumber of unconstrained degrees of freedom. The nullity is the degrees\nof freedom in the resulting space of solutions. To put it yet another\nway:\n\n> *The number of variables [**minus**]{} the number of independent\n> linear constraints [**equals**]{} the number of linearly independent\n> solutions.*",
