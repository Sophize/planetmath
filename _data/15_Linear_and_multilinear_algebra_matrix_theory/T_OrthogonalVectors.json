  "definition": "Two vectors, $v_1$ and $v_2$, are orthogonal if and only if their inner\nproduct $\\left<x,y\\right>$is 0. In two dimensions, orthogonal vectors\nare perpendicular (or in $n$ dimensions in the plane defined by the two\nvectors.)\n\nA set of vectors is orthogonal when, taken pairwise, any two vectors in\nthe set are orthogonal.",
