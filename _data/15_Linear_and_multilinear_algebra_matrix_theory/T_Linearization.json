  "definition": "*Linearization* is the process of reducing a homogeneous polynomial into\na multilinear map over a commutative ring. There are in general two ways\nof doing this:\n\n-   **Method 1.** Given any homogeneous polynomial $f$ of degree $n$ in\n    $m$ indeterminates over a commutative scalar ring $R$ (scalar simply\n    means that the elements of $R$ commute with the indeterminates).\n\n    1.  If all indeterminates are linear in $f$, then we are done.\n\n    2.  Otherwise, pick an indeterminate $x$ such that $x$ is not linear\n        in $f$. Without loss of generality, write $f=f(x,X)$, where $X$\n        is the set of indeterminates in $f$ excluding $x$. Define\n        $g(x_1,x_2,X):=f(x_1+x_2,X)-f(x_1,X)-f(x_2,X)$. Then $g$ is a\n        homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in $m+1$ indeterminates.\n        However, the highest degree of $x_1,x_2$ is $n-1$, one less that\n        of $x$.\n\n    3.  Repeat the process, starting with Step 1, for the homogeneous\n        polynomial $g$. Continue until the set $X$ of indeterminates is\n        enlarged to one $X^{'}$ such that each $x\\in X^{'}$ is linear.\n\n-   **Method 2.** This method applies only to homogeneous polynomials\n    that are also homogeneous in each indeterminate, when the other\n    indeterminates are held constant, i.e., $f(tx,X)=t^nf(x,X)$ for some\n    $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and any $t\\in R$. Note that if all of the\n    indeterminates in $f$ commute with each other, then $f$ is\n    essentially a monomial. So this method is particularly useful when\n    indeterminates are non-commuting. If this is the case, then we use\n    the following algorithm:\n\n    1.  If $x$ is not linear in $f$ and that $f(tx,X)=t^nf(x,X)$,\n        replace $x$ with a formal linear combination of $n$\n        indeterminates over $R$:\n        $$r_1x_1+\\cdots+r_nx_n\\mbox{,   where }r_i\\in R.$$\n\n    2.  Define a polynomial $g\\in R\\langle x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\rangle$, the\n        non-commuting free algebra over $R$ (generated by the\n        non-commuting indeterminates $x_i$) by:\n        $$g(x_1,\\ldots,x_n):=f(r_1x_1+\\cdots+r_nx_n).$$\n\n    3.  Expand $g$ and take the sum of the monomials in $g$ whose\n        coefficent is $r_1\\cdots r_n$. The result is a linearization of\n        $f$ for the indeterminate $x$.\n\n    4.  Take the next non-linear indeterminate and start over (with Step\n        1). Repeat the process until $f$ is completely linearized.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1.  The method of linearization is used often in the studies of Lie\n    algebras, Jordan algebras, PI-algebras and quadratic forms.\n\n2.  If the characteristic of scalar ring $R$ is 0 and $f$ is a monomial\n    in one indeterminate, we can recover $f$ back from its linearization\n    by setting all of its indeterminates to a single indeterminate $x$\n    and dividing the resulting polynomial by $n!$:\n    $$f(x)=\\frac{1}{n!}\\operatorname{linearization}(f)(x,\\ldots,x).$$\n    Please see the first example below.\n\n3.  If $f$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$, then the\n    linearized $f$ is a multilinear map in $n$ indeterminates.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n-   $f(x)=x^2$. Then $f(x_1+x_2)-f(x_1)-f(x_2)=x_1x_2+x_2x_1$ is a\n    linearization of $x^2$. In general, if $f(x)=x^n$, then the\n    linearization of $f$ is\n    $$\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n}x_{\\sigma(1)}\\cdots x_{\\sigma(n)}=\n    \\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_n}\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{\\sigma(i)},$$ where $S_n$ is\n    the symmetric group on $\\lbrace1,\\ldots,n\\rbrace$. If in addition\n    all the indeterminates commute with each other and $n!\\neq0$ in the\n    ground ring, then the linearization becomes\n    $$n!x_1\\cdots x_n=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}ix_i.$$\n\n-   $f(x,y)=x^3y^2+xyxyx$. Since $f(tx,y)=t^3f(x,y)$ and\n    $f(x,ty)=t^2f(x,y)$, $f$ is homogeneous over $x$ and $y$ separately,\n    and thus we can linearize $f$. First, collect all the monomials\n    having coefficient $abc$ in $(ax_1+bx_2+cx_3,y)$, we get\n    $$g(x_1,x_2,x_3,y):=\\sum x_ix_jx_ky^2+x_iyx_jyx_k,$$ where\n    $i,j,k\\in \n    {1,2,3}$ and $(i-j)(j-k)(k-i)\\neq0$. Repeat this for $y$ and we have\n    $$h(x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2):=\\sum x_ix_jx_k(y_1y_2+y_2y_1)+(x_iy_1x_jy_2x_k+x_iy_2x_jy_1x_k).$$",
