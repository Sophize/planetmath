  "definition": "Let $L:U\\rightarrow V$ be a linear mapping. A linear equation is called\n[*homogeneous*]{} if it has the form $$L(u)=0,\\quad u\\in U.$$ A\nhomogeneous linear problem always has a trivial solution, namely $u=0$.\nThe key issue in homogeneous problems is, therefore, the question of the\nexistence of non-trivial solutions, i.e. whether or not the kernel of\n$L$ is trivial, or equivalently, whether or not $L$ is injective.",
