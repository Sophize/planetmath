  "statement": "Denote by ${\\mathrm{M}}_n({\\mathcal}{K})$ the set of all $n \\times n$\nmatrices over ${\\mathcal}{K}$. Let\n$d_i\\colon {\\mathrm{M}}_n({\\mathcal}{K}) \\longrightarrow {\\mathcal}{K}$\nbe the function which extracts the $i$th diagonal element of a matrix,\nand let\n$\\varepsilon_i\\colon {\\mathcal}{K}^n \\longrightarrow {\\mathcal}{K}$ be\nthe function which extracts the $i$th of a vector. Finally denote by\n$[n]$ the set $\\{1,\\dotsc,n\\}$.\n\nLet ${\\mathcal}{K}$ be a field. For any sequence\n$A_1,\\dotsc,A_r \\in {\\mathrm{M}}_n({\\mathcal}{K})$ of upper triangular\npairwise commuting matrices and every row index $i \\in [n]$, there\nexists ${\\mathbf}{u} \\in {\\mathcal}{K}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that\n$$A_k {\\mathbf}{u} = d_i(A_k) {\\mathbf}{u}\n    \\quad\\text{for all \\(k \\in [r]\\).}$$\n\nLet $\\lambda_k = d_i(A_k)$ for all $k \\in [r]$, so that the problem is\nto find a common eigenvector ${\\mathbf}{u}$ of $A_1,\\dotsc,A_r$ whose\ncorresponding eigenvalue for $A_k$ is $\\lambda_k$. It is sufficient to\nfind such a common eigenvector in the case that $i=n$ is the least\n$i \\in [n]$ for which $d_i(A_k) = \\lambda_k$ for all $k \\in [r]$,\nbecause if some smaller $i$ also has this property then one can solve\nthe corresponding problem for the $i \\times i$ submatrices consisting of\nrows and columns $1$ through $i$ of $A_1,\\dotsc,A_r$, and then pad the\ncommon eigenvector of these submatrices with zeros to get a common\neigenvector of the original $A_1,\\dotsc,A_r$.\n\nBy the existence of a there exists a matrix $C$ in the unital algebra\ngenerated by $A_1,\\dotsc,A_r$ such that $d_i(C)=1$ if\n$d_i(A_k)=\\lambda_k$ for all $k \\in [r]$, and $d_i(C)=0$ otherwise; in\nother words that matrix $C$ satisfies $d_n(C)=1$ and $d_i(C)=0$ for all\n$i<n$. Since it is also upper triangular it follows that the matrix\n$I-C$ has $n-1$, so the kernel of this matrix is one-dimensional. Let\n${\\mathbf}{u} = (u_1,\\dotsc,u_n) \\in \n  \\ker(I -\\nobreak C)$ be such that $u_n=1$; it is easy to see that this\nis always possible (indeed, the only vector in this nullspace with $n$th\n$0$ is the zero vector). This ${\\mathbf}{u}$ is the wanted eigenvector.\n\nTo see that it is an eigenvector of $A_k$, one may first observe that\n$C$ commutes with this $A_k$, since the unital algebra of matrices to\nwhich $C$ belongs is . This implies that\n$A_k {\\mathbf}{u} \\in \\ker (I -\\nobreak C)$ since ${\\mathbf}{0} = \n  A_k {\\mathbf}{0} = A_k (I -\\nobreak C) {\\mathbf}{u} = \n  (I -\\nobreak C) A_k {\\mathbf}{u}$. As $\\ker (I -\\nobreak C)$ is\none-dimensional it follows that\n$A_k {\\mathbf}{u} = \\lambda {\\mathbf}{u}$ for some\n$\\lambda \\in {\\mathcal}{K}$. Since $A_k$ is upper triangular and $u_n=1$\nthis $\\lambda$ must furthermore satisfy\n$\\lambda = \\lambda u_n = \\varepsilon_n(\\lambda{\\mathbf}{u}) = \n  \\varepsilon_n(A_k{\\mathbf}{u}) = d_n(A_k) u_n = d_n(A_k)$, which is\nindeed what the eigenvalue was claimed to be.",
