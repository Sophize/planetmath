  "statement": "**theorem:** Let $R$ be commutative ring with identity. If an n-square\nmatrix $A \\in Mat_{n}(R)$ is supertriangular then $A^n = 0$.\\\n\\\n**proof:** Find the characteristic polynomial of $A$ by computing the\ndeterminant of $A-tI$. The square matrix $A-tI$ is a triangular matrix.\nThe determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal\nelement of the matrix. Therefore the characteristic polynomial is\n$p(t) =t^n$ and by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem the matrix $A$ satisfies\nthe polynomial. That is $A^n = 0$.\\\nQED",
