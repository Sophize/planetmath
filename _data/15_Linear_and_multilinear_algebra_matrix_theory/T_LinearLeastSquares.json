  "definition": "Let $A$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix with $m \\ge n$ and $b$ an $m \\times 1$\nmatrix. We want to consider the problem\n\n$$Ax \\approx b$$\n\nwhere $\\approx$ stands for the best approximate solution in the least\nsquares sense, i.e. we want to minimize the Euclidean norm of the\nresidual $r = Ax - b$\n\n$$||Ax-b||_2 = ||r||_2 = \\left[\\sum_{i=1}^m r_i^2 \\right]^{1/2}$$\n\nWe want to find the vector $x$ which is closest to $b$ in the column\nspace of $A$.\n\nAmong the different methods to solve this problem, we mention Normal\nEquations, sometimes ill-conditioned, QR Decomposition, and, most\ngenerally, Singular Value Decomposition.

This problem can be described by $Ax = b$\nwith\n\n$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} \\end{bmatrix} ; x = \\begin{bmatrix}u \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix} ;b = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_m \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThis is clearly an inconsistent system of linear equations, with more\nequations than unknowns, a frequently occurring problem in experimental\ndata analysis. The system is, however, not very inconsistent and there\nis a point that lies \u201cnearly\u201d on all straight lines. The solution can be\nfound with the linear least squares method, e.g. by QR decomposition for\nsolving $Ax = b$:\n\n$$QRx = b \\rightarrow x = R^{-1}Q^Tb$$\n\n[**References**]{}\n\n-   Originally from The Data Analysis Briefbook ()\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   S.S.M.
