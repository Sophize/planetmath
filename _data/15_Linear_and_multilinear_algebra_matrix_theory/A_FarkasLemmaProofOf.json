  "argumentText": "We begin by showing that at least one of the systems has a solution.\n\nSuppose that system 2 has no solution. Let $S$ be the cone in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ generated by nonnegative linear combinations of the rows\n$a_1,\\dots, a_m$ of $A$. The set $S$ is closed and convex. Since system\n2 is unsolvable, the vector $c$ is not in $S$; therefore, there exist a\nscalar $\\alpha$ and $n$-column vector $x$ such that the hyperplane\n$x^T v=\\alpha$ separates $c$ from $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This hyperplane\ncan be selected so that for any point $v\\in S$,\n$$x^T c^T > \\alpha > x^T v^T.$$ Since $0\\in S$, this implies that\n$\\alpha>0$. Hence for any $w\\ge 0$,\n$$\\alpha > x^T (wA)^T = wAx = \\sum_{i=0}^m w_i (Ax)_i.$$\n\nEach $(Ax)_i$ is nonpositive. Otherwise, by selecting $w$ with $w_i$\nsufficiently large and all other $w_j=0$, we would get a contradiction.\nWe have now shown that $x$ satisfies $Ax\\leq 0$ and\n$cx =(cx)^T=x^T c^T > \\alpha > 0$, which means that $x$ is a solution of\nsystem 1. Thus at least one of the systems is solvable.\n\nWe claim that systems 1 and 2 are not simultaneously solvable. Suppose\nthat $x$ is a solution of system 1 and $w$ is a solution of system 2.\nThen for each $i$, the inequality $w_i (Ax)_i\\le 0$ holds, and so\n$w(Ax)\\le 0$. However, $$(wA)x=cx>0,$$ a contradiction. This completes\nthe proof.",
