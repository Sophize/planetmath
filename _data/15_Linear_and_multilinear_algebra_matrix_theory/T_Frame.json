  "definition": "#### Introduction\n\nFrames and coframes are notions closely related to the notions of basis\nand dual basis. As such, frames and coframes are needed to describe the\nconnection between and the more general .\n\n#### Frames and bases.\n\nLet ${\\mathcal{U}}$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field\n${\\mathbb{K}}$, and let $I$ be a finite, totally ordered set of\nindices[^1], e.g. $(1,2,\\ldots,n)$. We will call a mapping\n${\\mathbf{F}}:I\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{U}}$ a reference frame, or simply a\nframe. To put it plainly, ${\\mathbf{F}}$ is just a list of elements of\n${\\mathcal{U}}$ with indices belong to $I$. We will adopt a notation to\nreflect this and write ${\\mathbf{F}}_i$ instead of ${\\mathbf{F}}(i)$.\nSubscripts are used when writing the frame elements because it is best\nto regard a frame as a row-vector[^2] whose entries happen to be\nelements of ${\\mathcal{U}}$, and write\n$${\\mathbf{F}}= ({\\mathbf{F}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathbf{F}}_n).$$ This is\nappropriate because every reference frame ${\\mathbf{F}}$ naturally\ncorresponds to a linear mapping\n${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}:{\\mathbb{K}}^I\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}$ defined\nby\n$${\\mathbf{a}}\\mapsto \\sum_{i\\in I} {\\mathbf{a}}^i\\, {\\mathbf{F}}_i,\\quad {\\mathbf{a}}\\in {\\mathbb{K}}^I.$$\nIn other words, ${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}$ is a linear form on\n${\\mathbb{K}}^I$ that takes values in ${\\mathcal{U}}$ instead of\n${\\mathbb{K}}$. We use row vectors to represent linear forms, and that\u2019s\nwhy we write the frame as a row vector.\n\nWe call ${\\mathbf{F}}$ a coordinate frame (equivalently, a basis), if\n${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Otherwise we\ncall ${\\mathbf{F}}$ degenerate, incomplete, or both, depending on\nwhether ${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}$ fails to be, respectively, injective and\nsurjective.\n\n#### Coframes and coordinates.\n\nIn cases where ${\\mathbf{F}}$ is a basis, the inverse isomorphism\n$${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}^{-1}:{\\mathcal{U}}\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}^I$$ is\ncalled the coordinate mapping. It is cumbersome to work with this\ninverse explicitly, and instead we introduce linear forms\n${\\mathbf{x}}^i\\in {\\mathcal{U}}^*,\\; i\\in I$ defined by\n$${\\mathbf{x}}^i:{\\mathbf{u}}\\mapsto {\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}^{-1}({\\mathbf{u}})(i),\\quad {\\mathbf{u}}\\in {\\mathcal{U}}.$$\nEach ${\\mathbf{x}}^i,\\; i\\in I$ is called the $i{^{\\text{th}}}$\ncoordinate function relative to ${\\mathbf{F}}$, or simply the\n$i{^{\\text{th}}}$ coordinate[^3]. In this way we obtain a mapping\n$${\\mathbf{x}}:I\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}^*,\\quad i\\mapsto {\\mathbf{x}}^i$$\ncalled the [ *coordinate coframe*]{} or simply a [*coframe*]{}. The\nforms ${\\mathbf{x}}^i,\\,i\n\\in I$ give a basis of ${\\mathcal{U}}^*$. It is the dual basis of\n${\\mathbf{F}}_i,\\,i \\in\nI$, i.e. $${\\mathbf{x}}^i({\\mathbf{F}}_j) = \\delta^i_j,\\quad i,j\\in I,$$\nwhere $\\delta^i_j$ is the well-known Kronecker symbol.\n\nIn full duality to the custom of writing frames as row-vectors, we write\nthe coframe as a column vector whose components are the coordinate\nfunctions: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathbf{x}}^1\\\\ {\\mathbf{x}}^2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {\\mathbf{x}}^n\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$ We identify of ${\\hat{{\\mathbf{F}}}}^{-1}$ and\n${\\mathbf{x}}$ with the above column-vector. This is quite natural\nbecause all of these objects are in natural correspondence with a\n${\\mathbb{K}}$-valued functions of two arguments,\n$${\\mathcal{U}}\\times I \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}},$$ that maps an\nabstract vector ${\\mathbf{u}}\\in {\\mathcal{U}}$ and an index $i\\in I$ to\na scalar ${\\mathbf{x}}^i({\\mathbf{u}})$, called the $i{^{\\text{th}}}$\ncomponent of ${\\mathbf{u}}$ relative to the reference frame\n${\\mathbf{F}}$.\n\n#### Change of frame.\n\nGiven two coordinate frames ${\\mathbf{F}}:I\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}$\nand ${\\mathbf{G}}:J\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}$, one can easily show that\n$I$ and $J$ must have the same cardinality. Letting\n${\\mathbf{x}}^i,\\,i\\in I$ and ${\\mathbf{y}}^j,\\,j\\in\nJ$ denote the coordinates functions relative to ${\\mathbf{F}}$ and\n${\\mathbf{G}}$, respectively, we define the transition matrix from\n${\\mathbf{F}}$ to ${\\mathbf{G}}$ to be the matrix\n$${\\mathcal{M}}:I\\times J\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}$$ with entries\n$${\\mathcal{M}}^j_i = {\\mathbf{y}}^j({\\mathbf{F}}_i),\\quad i\\in I,\\; j\\in J.$$\nAn equivalent description of the transition matrix is given by\n$${\\mathbf{y}}^j = \\sum_{i\\in I} {\\mathcal{M}}^j_i\\, {\\mathbf{x}}^i,\\quad \\mbox{for all }j\\in J.$$\n\nIt is also the custom to regard the elements of $I$ as indexing the\ncolumns of the matrix, while the elements of $J$ label the rows. Thus,\nfor $I=(1,2,\\ldots,n)$ and $J=(\\bar{1},\\bar{2},\\ldots,\\bar{n})$, we can\nwrite $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{1}}_1 & \\ldots &{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{1}}_n \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  {\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{n}}_1 & \\ldots &{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{n}}_n\n\\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathbf{y}}^{\\bar{1}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {\\mathbf{y}}^{\\bar{n}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathbf{F}}_1 & \\ldots & {\\mathbf{F}}_n\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$ In this way we can describe the relation between\ncoordinates relative to the two frames in terms of ordinary matrix\nmultiplication. To wit, we can write $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathbf{y}}^{\\bar{1}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {\\mathbf{y}}^{\\bar{n}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{1}}_1 & \\ldots &{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{1}}_n \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  {\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{n}}_1 & \\ldots &{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\bar{n}}_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  {\\mathbf{x}}^1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ {\\mathbf{x}}^n\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n#### Notes.\n\nThe term frame is often used to refer to objects that should properly be\ncalled a [*moving frame*]{}. The latter can be thought of as a , or\nfunctions taking values in the space of all frames, and are fully\ndescribed elsewhere. The confusion in terminology is unfortunate but\nquite common, and is related to the questionable practice of using the\nword [*scalar*]{} when referring to a [*scalar field*]{} (a.k.a.\nscalar-valued functions) and using the word [*vector*]{} when referring\nto a [ *vector field.*]{}\n\nWe also mention that in the world of theoretical physics, the preferred\nterminology seems to be [*polyad*]{} and related specializations, rather\nthan frame. Most commonly used are [ *dyad*]{}, for a frame of two\nelements, and [*tetrad*]{} for a frame of four elements.\n\n[^1]: It is advantageous to allow general indexing sets, because one can\n    indicate the use of multiple frames of reference by employing\n    multiple, disjoint sets of indices.\n\n[^2]: It is customary to use superscripts for the components of a column\n    vector, and subscripts for the components of a row vector. This is\n    fully described in the .\n\n[^3]: Strictly speaking, we should be denote the coframe by\n    ${\\mathbf{x}}_{\\mathbf{F}}$ and the coordinate functions by\n    ${\\mathbf{x}}^i_{\\mathbf{F}}$ so as to reflect their dependence on\n    the choice of reference frame. Historically, writers have been loath\n    to do this, preferring a couple of different notational tricks to\n    avoid ambiguity. The cleanest approach is to use different symbols,\n    e.g. ${\\mathbf{x}}^i$ versus ${\\mathbf{y}}^j$, to distinguish\n    coordinates coming from different frames. Another approach is to use\n    distinct indexing sets; in this way the indices themselves will\n    indicate the choice of frame. Say we have two frames\n    ${\\mathbf{F}}: I\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}$ and\n    ${\\mathbf{G}}:J\\rightarrow {\\mathcal{U}}$ with $I$ and $J$ distinct\n    finite sets. We stipulate that the symbol $i$ refers to elements of\n    $I$ and that $j$ refers to elements of $J$, and write\n    ${\\mathbf{x}}^i$ for coordinates relative to ${\\mathbf{F}}$ and\n    ${\\mathbf{x}}^j$ for coordinates relative to ${\\mathbf{G}}$. That\u2019s\n    the way it was done in all the old-time geometry and physics papers,\n    and is still largely the way physicists go about writing\n    coordinates. Be that as it may, the notation has its problems and is\n    the subject of long-standing controversy, named by mathematicians\n    the debauche of indices. The problem is that the notation employs\n    the same symbol, namely ${\\mathbf{x}}$, to refer to two different\n    objects, namely a map with domain $I$ and another map with domain\n    $J$. In practice, ambiguity is avoided because the old-time notation\n    [*never*]{} refers to the coframe (or indeed any tensor) without\n    also writing the indices. This is the classical way of the dummy\n    variable, a cousin to the $f(x)$ notation. It creates some confusion\n    for beginners, but with a little practice it\u2019s a perfectly\n    serviceable and useful way to communicate.",
