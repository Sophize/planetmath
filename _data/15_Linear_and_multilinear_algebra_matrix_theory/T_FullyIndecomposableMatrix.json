  "definition": "An $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ that contains an $s \\times (n-s)$ zero\nsubmatrix for some positive integer $s$ is said to be [*partly\ndecomposable*]{}. If no such submatrix exists then $A$ is said to be *it\nfully indecomposable*. By convention, a $1 \\times 1$ matrix is fully\nindecomposable if it is nonzero. $A$ is [*nearly decomposable*]{} if it\nfully indecomposable but whenever a nonzero entry is changed to 0 the\nresulting matrix is partly decomposable.",
