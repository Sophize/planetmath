  "definition": "Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$. Fix a linear transformation\n$T$ on $V$. Suppose $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$. The set\n$\\lbrace v\\in V\\mid Tv=\\lambda v\\rbrace$ is called the *eigenspace* (of\n$T$) corresponding to $\\lambda$. Let us write this set $W_{\\lambda}$.\n\nBelow are some basic properties of eigenspaces.\n\n1.  $W_{\\lambda}$ can be viewed as the kernel of the linear\n    transformation $T-\\lambda I$. As a result, $W_{\\lambda}$ is a\n    subspace of $V$.\n\n2.  The dimension of $W_{\\lambda}$ is called the geometric multiplicity\n    of $\\lambda$. Let us denote this by $g_{\\lambda}$. It is easy to see\n    that $1\\le g_{\\lambda}$, since the existence of an eigenvalue means\n    the existence of a non-zero eigenvector corresponding to the\n    eigenvalue.\n\n3.  $W_{\\lambda}$ is an invariant subspace under $T$ ($T$-invariant).\n\n4.  $W_{\\lambda_1}\\cap W_{\\lambda_2}=0$ iff $\\lambda_1\\ne \\lambda_2$.\n\n5.  In fact, if $W_{\\lambda}'$ is the sum of eigenspaces corresponding\n    to eigenvalues of $T$ other than $\\lambda$, then\n    $W_{\\lambda}\\cap W_{\\lambda}'=0$.\n\nFrom now on, we assume $V$ finite-dimensional.\n\nLet $S_T$ be the set of all eigenvalues of $T$ and let\n$W=\\oplus_{\\lambda \\in S} W_{\\lambda}$. We have the following\nproperties:\n\n1.  If $m_{\\lambda}$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\\lambda$, then\n    $g_{\\lambda}\\le m_{\\lambda}$.\n\n2.  Suppose the characteristic polynomial $p_T(x)$ of $T$ can be\n    factored into linear terms, then $T$ is diagonalizable iff\n    $m_{\\lambda}=g_{\\lambda}$ for every $\\lambda\\in S_T$.\n\n3.  In other words, if $p_T(x)$ splits over $k$, then $T$ is\n    diagonalizable iff $V=W$.\n\nFor example, let $T:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be given by\n$T(x,y)=(x,x+y)$. Using the standard basis, $T$ is represented by the\nmatrix\n\n$M_T=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.$\n\nFrom this matrix, it is easy to see that $p_T(x)=(x-1)^2$ is the\ncharacteristic polynomial of $T$ and $1$ is the only eigenvalue of $T$\nwith $m_1=2$. Also, it is not hard to see that $T(x,y)=(x,y)$ only when\n$y=0$. So $W_1$ is a one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$\ngenerated by $(1,0)$. As a result, $T$ is not diagonalizable.",
