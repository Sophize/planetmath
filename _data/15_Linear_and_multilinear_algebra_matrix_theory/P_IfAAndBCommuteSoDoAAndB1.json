  "statement": "Let $A$ and $B$ be commuting matrices. If $B$ is invertible, then $A$\nand $B^{-1}$ commute, and if $A$ and $B$ are invertible, then $A^{-1}$\nand $B^{-1}$ commute.\n\nBy assumption $$AB = BA,$$ multiplying from the left and from the right\nby $B^{-1}$ yields $$B^{-1} A = A B^{-1}.$$ The second claim follows\nsimilarly.\n\nThe statement and proof of this result can obviously be extended to\nelements of any monoid. In particular, in the case of a group, we see\nthat two elements commute if and only if their inverses do.",
