  "definition": "Let $D$ be a division ring, and $M$ an $m\\times n$ matrix over $D$.\nThere are four numbers we can associate with $M$:\n\n1.  the dimension of the subspace spanned by the columns of $M$ viewed\n    as elements of the $n$-dimensional right vector space over $D$.\n\n2.  the dimension of the subspace spanned by the columns of $M$ viewed\n    as elements of the $n$-dimensional left vector space over $D$.\n\n3.  the dimension of the subspace spanned by the rows of $M$ viewed as\n    elements of the $m$-dimensional right vector space over $D$.\n\n4.  the dimension of the subspace spanned by the rows of $M$ viewed as\n    elements of the $m$-dimensional left vector space over $D$.\n\nThe numbers are respectively called the *right column rank*, *left\ncolumn rank*, *right row rank*, and *left row rank* of $M$, and they are\nrespectively denoted by $\\operatorname{rc.rnk}(M)$,\n$\\operatorname{lc.rnk}(M)$, $\\operatorname{rr.rnk}(M)$, and\n$\\operatorname{lr.rnk}(M)$.\n\nSince the columns of $M$ are the rows of its transpose $M^T$, we have\n$$\\operatorname{lc.rnk}(M)=\\operatorname{lr.rnk}(M^T), \\qquad \\textrm{and} \\qquad  \\operatorname{rc.rnk}(M)=\\operatorname{rr.rnk}(M^T).$$\n\nIn addition, it can be shown that for a given matrix $M$,\n$$\\operatorname{lc.rnk}(M)=\\operatorname{rr.rnk}(M), \\qquad \\textrm{and} \\qquad  \\operatorname{rc.rnk}(M)=\\operatorname{lr.rnk}(M).$$\nFor any $0\\ne r\\in D$, it is also easy to see that the left column and\nrow ranks of $rM$ are the same as those of $M$. Similarly, the right\ncolumn and row ranks of $Mr$ are the same as those of $M$.\n\nIf $D$ is a field, $\\operatorname{lc.rnk}(M)=\\operatorname{rc.rnk}(M)$,\nso that all four numbers are the same, and we simply call this number\nthe *rank* of $M$, denoted by $\\operatorname{rank}(M)$.\n\nRank can also be defined for matrices $M$ (over a fixed $D$) that\nsatisfy the identity $M=rM^T$, where $r$ is in the center of $D$.\nMatrices satisfying the identity include symmetric and anti-symmetric\nmatrices.\n\nHowever, the left column rank is not necessarily the same as the right\nrow rank of a matrix, if the underlying division ring is not\ncommutative, as can be shown in the following example: let $u=(1,j)$ and\n$v=(i,k)$ be vectors over the Hamiltonian quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$. They\nare columns in the $2\\times 2$ matrix $$M:=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & i \\\\\nj & k\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ Since $iu=(i,ij)=(i,k)=v$, they are left linearly\ndependent, and therefore the left column rank of $M$ is $1$. Now,\nsuppose $ur+vs=(0,0)$, with $r,s\\in \\mathbb{H}$. Since\n$ui=(i,ji)=(i,-k)$, then $ui(-ir)+vs=0$, which boils down to two\nequations $ir=s$ and $-ir=s$, and which imply that $s=r=0$, showing that\n$u,v$ are right linearly independent. Thus the right column rank of $M$\nis $2$.",
