  "definition": "The *Einstein summation convention* implies that when an index occurs\nmore than once in the same expression, the expression is implicitly\nsummed over all possible values for that index. Therefore, in order to\nuse the summation convention, it must be clear from the context over\nwhat range indices should be summed.\n\nThe Einstein summation convention is illustrated in the below examples.\n\n1.  Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a orthogonal basis in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then\n    the inner product of the vectors $u=u^i e_i=(\\sum_{i=1}^n) u^i e_i$\n    and $v=v^i e_i =(\\sum_{i=1}^n) v^i e_i$, is $$\\begin{aligned}\n    u\\cdot v &=& u^i v^j e_i\\cdot e_j \\\\\n             &=& \\delta_{ij} u^i v^j.\\end{aligned}$$\n\n2.  Let $V$ be a vector space with basis $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and a dual\n    basis $\\{e^i\\}_{i=1}^n$. Then, for a vector $v=v^i e_i$ and dual\n    vectors $\\alpha=\\alpha_i e^i$ and $\\beta=\\beta_i e^i$, we have\n    $$\\begin{aligned}\n     (\\alpha+\\beta)(v) &=& \\alpha_iv^i + \\beta_j v^j \\\\\n            &=& (\\alpha_i + \\beta_i) v^i.\\end{aligned}$$ This example\n    shows that the summation convention is \u201cdistributive\u201d in a natural\n    way.\n\n3.  Chain rule. Let $F:\\mathbb{R}^m\\to \\mathbb{R}^n$,\n    $x \\mapsto (F^1,\\cdots, F^n)$, and $G:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to \\mathbb{R}^p$,\n    $y \\mapsto (G^1(y),\\cdots, G^p(y))$ be smooth functions. Then\n    $$\\frac{\\partial (G\\circ F)^i}{\\partial x^j}(x) = \\frac{\\partial G^i}{\\partial y^k} \\big(F(x)\\big) \\frac{\\partial F^k}{\\partial x^j}(x),$$\n    where the right hand side is summed over $k=1,\\ldots,n$.\n\nAn index which is summed is called a *dummy index* or *dummy variable*.\nFor instance, $i$ is a dummy index in $v^i e_i$. An expression does not\ndepend on a dummy index, i.e., $v^i e_i = v^j e_j$. It is common that\none must change the name of dummy indices. For instance, above, in\nExample 2 when we calculated $u\\cdot  v$, it was necessary to change the\nindex $i$ in $v=v^i e_i$ to $j$ so that it would not clash with\n$u=u^i e_i$.\n\nWhen using the Einstein summation convention, objects are usually\nindexed so that when summing, one index will always be an \u201cupper index\u201d\nand the other a \u201clower index\u201d. Then summing should only take place over\nupper and lower indices. In the above examples, we have followed this\nrule. Therefore we did not write $\\delta_{ij} u^i v^j = u^i v^i$ in the\nfirst example since $u^i v^i$ has two upper indices. This is consistent;\nit is not possible to take the inner product of two vectors without a\nmetric, which is here $\\delta_{ij}$. The last example illustrates that\nwhen we consider $k$ as a \u201clower index\u201d in\n$\\frac{\\partial G^i}{\\partial y^k}$, then the chain rule obeys this\nupper-lower rule for the indices.",
