  "definition": "### Definition of the permanent {#definition-of-the-permanent .unnumbered}\n\nLet $M$ be an $n\\times n$ matrix over a field (or even a commutative\nring) $\\Fset$, and $M_{ij}$ its entries (with $i$ ranging over a set $I$\nand $j$ over a set $J$, each of $n$ elements).\n\nThe [**permanent**]{} of $M$, denoted by $\\per M$, is given by\n$$\\per M \\;\\isdef\\; \n  \\sum_{\\pi\\,\\in\\,S} \\; \\prod_{i\\,\\in\\,I} \\; M_{i\\;\\pi(i)}$$ where $S$\nis the set of all $n!$ bijections $\\pi : I\\to J$. Usually $I$ and $J$\nare identified with each other (and with the set of the first $n$\nnatural numbers, traditionally skipping 0) so that $S$ consists of the\nelements of the symmetric group $S_n$, the group of permutations of $n$\nobjects.\n\nIn words: we want products of each time $n$ matrix elements chosen such\nthat there\u2019s one from each row $i$ and also one from each column $j$.\nThere are $n!$ ways to pick those elements (for any permutation of the\ncolumn indices relative to the row indices take the elements that end up\nin diagonal position). The permanent is the sum of those $n!$ products.\nE.g.\u00a0($n=3$)\n\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     @ O O     O @ O     O O @     @ O O     O @ O     O O @\"}$\\\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     O @ O  +  O O @  +  @ O O  +  O O @  +  @ O O  +  O @ O\"}$\\\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     O O @     @ O O     O @ O     O @ O     O O @     @ O O\"}$\n\n### Comparison with the determinant {#comparison-with-the-determinant .unnumbered}\n\nIt is closely related to one of the ways to define the determinant,\n$$\\det M \\;\\isdef\\; \n  \\sum_{\\pi\\,\\in\\,S_I} \\pm \\prod_{i\\,\\in\\,I} \\; M_{i\\;\\pi(i)}$$ where\n$S_I$ is the symmetry group of $I$ (isomorphic to $S_n$); the sign is\n$+$ for even permutations and $-$ for odd ones. E.g.\u00a0($n=3$)\n\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     @ O O     O @ O     O O @     @ O O     O @ O     O O @\"}$\\\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     O @ O  +  O O @  +  @ O O  -  O O @  -  @ O O  -  O @ O\"}$\\\n$\\hbox{\\verb\"     O O @     @ O O     O @ O     O @ O     O O @     @ O O\"}$\n\nNote two important differences though.\n\n-   While the determinant enjoys the property that $(\\det A)(\\det B)\n          = \\det(AB)$, the permanent has no such nice arithmetic\n    properties.\n\n-   In the definition of the determinant, we must have $I=J$ i.e.\u00a0we\n    must have a particular way in mind of matching rows to columns. A\n    matrix to transform from one basis to another would be an example\n    where this match is arbitrary. Different conventions which row goes\n    with which column give two different values (one $-1$ times the\n    other) for the determinant. By contrast, the permanent is well\n    defined for any $I$ and $J$.\n\nIn the representation theory of groups (where the field $\\Fset$ is\n$\\Cset$) determinant and permanent are special cases of the\n[**immanent**]{} (there is an immanent for every character of $S_n$).\n\n### Some properties of the permanent {#some-properties-of-the-permanent .unnumbered}\n\nThese follow immediately from the definition:\n\n-   The permanent is \u201cmultilinear\u201d in the rows and columns (i.e. linear\n    in every one of them).\n\n-   It is \u201chomogeneous of degree $n$\u201d, i.e.\u00a0$\\per(kA) = k^n\\per(A)$,\n    where $k$ is a scalar (i.e.\u00a0element of $\\Fset$).\n\n-   When $P$ and $Q$ are permutation matrices, $\\per(PAQ) = \\per(PA)\n          = \\per(AQ) = \\per(A)$.\n\n-   $\\per(A^\\top) = \\per(A)$.\n\n-   $\\D\\per\\big({A\\;\\;0\\,\\atop\\,0\\;\\;D}\\big) = \\per(A)\\per(D)$.\n\n-   If $M$ only has nonnegative entries, then $$\\per M \\ge \\det M$$\n    Equality is attained\n\n    -   (with value 0) when the products (of entries, one from each row\n        and from each column) that contribute to det and per are all\n        zero. This happens whenever a whole column or row is zero, but\n        also for instance in $$\\left\\lgroup\n                      \\begin{array}{rrr}\n                      12  &  0  &  0  \\\\\n                      13  &  0  &  0  \\\\\n                      14  & 15  & 16\n                      \\end{array}\n                      \\right\\rgroup$$\n\n    -   when the permutations used are all even (which implies only one\n        is used). This happens in a diagonal matrix, but also for\n        instance in $$\\left\\lgroup\n                      \\begin{array}{cccc}\n                       0  &  1  &  0  &  0  \\\\\n                       1  &  0  &  0  &  0  \\\\\n                       0  &  0  &  0  &  1  \\\\\n                       0  &  0  &  1  &  0\n                      \\end{array}\n                      \\right\\rgroup$$\n\nPermanents find application in combinatorics, e.g.\u00a0in enumerating Latin\nsquares.\n\nSee also Van der Waerden\u2019s permanent conjecture (now a theorem) for\ndoubly stochastic matrices (where $\\Fset$ is $\\Rset$).\n\nNote: some authors define something for non-square matrices they also\ncall \u201cpermanent\u201d.",
