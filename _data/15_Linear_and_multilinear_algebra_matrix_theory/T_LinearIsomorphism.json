Then $L$ is a *linear isomorphism* if $L$ is bijective.\n\n### Properties {#properties .unnumbered}\n\n1.  Compositions and of linear isomorphisms is a linear isomorphism.\n\n2.  The inverse of a linear isomorphisms is a linear isomorphism.\n\n3.  If either $V$ or $W$ if finite dimensional, then $\\dim V=\\dim W$.\n    (This is a consequence of the rank-nullity theorem.)",
