  "definition": "Geometric algebra is a which has been used with great success in the\nmodeling of a wide variety of physical phenomena. Clifford algebra is\nconsidered a more general algebraic framework than geometric algebra.\nThe primary distinction is that geometric algebra utilizes only real\nnumbers as scalars and to represent magnitudes. The underlying\nphilosophical justification for this is the interpretation that the unit\nimaginary has geometric significance which naturally arises from the\nproperties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.\n\nLet ${\\cal{V}}^n$ be an $n$\u2013dimensional vector space over the real\nnumbers. As with traditional vector algebra, the vector space is spanned\nby a set of $n$ linearly independent basis vectors. Any vector in this\nspace may be represented by a linear combination of the basis vectors.\nIn the geometric algebra literature, such basis entities are also called\n*blades*.\n\nSince vectors are one-dimensional directed quantities, they are assigned\na *grade* of 1. Scalars are considered to be grade-0 entities. In\ngeometric algebra, there exist higher dimensional analogues to vectors.\nTwo-dimensional directed quantites are termed bivectors and they are\ngrade-2 entites. In general a $k$-dimensional entity is known as a\n$k$-vector.\n\nThe *geometric algebra* ${\\cal{G}}_n={\\cal{G}}({\\cal{V}}^n)$ is a\nmulti-graded algebra similar to Grassmann\u2019s exterior algebra, except\nthat the exterior product is replaced by a more fundamental\nmultiplication operation known as the *geometric product*. In general,\nthe result of the geometric product is a multi-graded object called a\n*multivector*. A multivector is a linear combination of basis blades.\n\nFor vectors $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c} \\in {\\cal{V}}^n$ and\nreal scalars $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbf{R}$, the geometric product\nsatisfies the following axioms:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\mbox{\\textbf{associativity:}} & \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{c}) = (\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b})\\mathbf{c} & \\mathbf{a}+(\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}) = (\\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{b})+\\mathbf{c} \\\\\n\\mbox{\\textbf{commutativity:}} & \\alpha\\beta = \\beta\\alpha & \\alpha+\\beta = \\beta+\\alpha \\\\\n& \\alpha\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}\\alpha & \\alpha+\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}+\\alpha \\\\\n& \\mathbf{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} + \\mathbf{ba}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} - \\mathbf{ba})\n& \\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{a} \\\\\n\\mbox{\\textbf{distributivity:}} & \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{c} & (\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c})\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{a}  \\\\\n\\mbox{\\textbf{linearity}} & \\alpha(\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}) = \\alpha\\mathbf{b}+\\alpha\\mathbf{c} = (\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c})\\alpha \\\\\n\\mbox{\\textbf{contraction:}} & \\mathbf{a}^2 = \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{a} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\epsilon_{i}|\\mathbf{a}_{i}|^2 = \\alpha & \\mbox{where } \\epsilon_{i} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}\n\\end{array}$$\n\nCommutativity of scalar\u2013scalar multiplication and vector\u2013scalar\nmultiplication is symmetric; however, in general, vector\u2013vector\nmultiplication is not commutative. The order of multiplication of\nvectors is significant. In particular, for parallel vectors:\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{a}$$ and for orthogonal\nvectors: $$\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b} = -\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{a}$$ The\nparallelism of vectors is encoded as a symmetric property, while\northogonality of vectors is encoded as an antisymmetric property.\n\nThe contraction rule specifies that the square of any vector is a scalar\nequal to the sum of the square of the magnitudes of its components in\neach basis direction. Depending on the contraction rule for each of the\nbasis directions, the magnitude of the vector may be positive, negative,\nor zero. A vector with a magnitude of zero is called a *null vector*.\n\nThe graded algebra ${\\cal{G}}_{n}$ generated from ${\\cal{V}}^{n}$ is\ndefined over a $2^{n}$-dimensional linear space. This basis entities for\nthis space can be generated by successive application of the geometric\nproduct to the basis vectors of ${\\cal{V}}^{n}$ until a closed set of\nbasis entities is obtained. The basis entites for the space are known as\n*blades*. The following multiplication table illustrates the generation\nof basis blades from the basis vectors\n$\\mathbf{e}_{1}, \\mathbf{e}_{2} \\in {\\cal{V}}^{n}$.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\epsilon_{0} & \\mathbf{e}_{1} & \\mathbf{e}_{2} & \\mathbf{e}_{12} \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_{1} & \\epsilon_{1} & \\mathbf{e}_{12} & \\epsilon_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_{2} & -\\mathbf{e}_{12} & \\epsilon_{2} & -\\epsilon_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{1} \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_{12} & -\\epsilon_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{2} & \\epsilon_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{1} & -\\epsilon_{1}\\epsilon_{2}\n\\end{array}$$\n\nHere, $\\epsilon_{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{2}$ represent the contraction rule\nfor $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{2}$ respectively. Note that the\nbasis vectors of ${\\cal{V}}^{n}$ become blades themselves in addition to\nthe multiplicative identity, $\\epsilon_{0} \\equiv 1$ and the new\n*bivector* $\\mathbf{e}_{12} \\equiv \\mathbf{e}_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{2}$. As the\ntable demonstrates, this set of basis blades is closed under the\ngeometric product.\n\nThe *geometric product* $\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b}$ is related to the inner\nproduct $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}$ and the exterior product\n$\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b}$ by\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}\\wedge\\mathbf{a} = 2\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{a}.$$\n\nIn the above example, the result of the inner (dot) product is a scalar\n(grade-0), while the result of the exterior (wedge) product is a\n*bivector* (grade-2).\n\nBibliography {#bibliography .unnumbered}\n============\n\n1.
