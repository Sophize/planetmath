  "definition": "A [*spinor*]{} is a certain kind of auxiliary mathematical object\nintroduced to expand the notion of spatial vector. Spinors are needed\nbecause the full structure of rotations in a given number of dimensions\nrequires some extra number of dimensions to exhibit it.\n\nMore formally, spinors can be defined as geometrical objects constructed\nfrom a given vector space endowed with an inner product by means of an\nalgebraic or quantization procedure. The rotation group acts upon the\nspace of spinors, but for an ambiguity in the sign of the action.\nSpinors thus form a projective representation of the rotation group. One\ncan remove this sign ambiguity by regarding the space of spinors as a\n(linear) group representation of the spin group Spin(n). In this\nalternative point of view, many of the intrinsic and algebraic\nproperties of spinors are more clearly visible, but the connection with\nthe original spatial geometry is more obscure. On the other hand the use\nof complex number scalars can be kept to a minimum.\n\nHistorically, spinors in general were discovered by \u00c9lie Cartan in 1913.\nLater spinors were adopted by quantum mechanics in order to study the\nproperties of the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron and other\nfermions. Today spinors enjoy a wide range of physics applications.\nClassically, spinors in three dimensions are used to describe the spin\nof the non-relativistic electron. Via the Dirac equation, Dirac spinors\nare required in the mathematical description of the quantum state of the\nrelativistic electron. In quantum field theory, spinors describe the\nstate of relativistic many-particle systems.\n\nIn the classical geometry of space, a vector exhibits a certain behavior\nwhen it is acted upon by a rotation or reflected in a hyperplane.\nHowever, in a certain sense rotations and reflections contain finer\ngeometrical information than can be expressed in terms of their actions\non vectors. Spinors are objects constructed in order to encompass more\nfully this geometry.\n\nThere are essentially two frameworks for viewing the notion of a spinor.\n\nOne is representation theoretic. In this point of view, one knows a\npriori that there are some representations of the Lie algebra of the\northogonal group which cannot be formed by the usual tensor\nconstructions. These missing representations are then labeled the \u201dspin\nrepresentations\u201d, and their constituents spinors. In this view, a spinor\nmust belong to a group representation|representation of the covering\nspace|double cover of the rotation group $SO(n, R)$, or more generally\nof the generalized special orthogonal group $SO(p, q, R)$ on spaces with\nmetric signature $(p, q)$. These double-covers are Lie groups, called\nthe spin groups $Spin(p, q)$. All the properties of spinors, and their\napplications and derived objects, are manifested first in the spin\ngroup.\n\nThe other point of view is geometrical. One can explicitly construct the\nspinors, and then examine how they behave under the action of the\nrelevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of being\nable to say precisely what a spinor is, without invoking some\nnon-constructive theorem from representation theory. Representation\ntheory must eventually supplement the geometrical machinery once the\nlatter becomes too unwieldy.\n\nThe most general mathematical form of spinors was discovered by \u00c3\u2030lie\nCartan in 1913. The word \u201cspinor\u201d was coined by Paul Ehrenfest in his\nwork on quantum physics.\n\nSpinors were first applied to mathematical physics by Wolfgang Pauli in\n1927, when he introduced Pauli matrices|spin matrices. The following\n1928|year, Paul Dirac discovered the fully special\nrelativity|relativistic theory of electron spin (physics)|spin by\nshowing the connection between spinors and the Lorentz group. By the\n1930s, Dirac, Piet Hein and others at the Niels Bohr Institute created\ngames such as \u201cTangloids\u201d to teach and model the calculus of spinors.\n\nSome important simple examples of spinors in low dimensions arise from\nconsidering the even-graded subalgebras of the Clifford algebra\n$Cl_{p, q}(R)$. This is an algebra built up from an orthonormal basis of\n$n = p + q$ mutually orthogonal vectors under addition and\nmultiplication, $p$ of which have norm +1 and $q$ of which have norm\n$-1$, with the product rule for the basis vectors\n\n$$e_i e_j = \\Bigg\\{ \\begin{matrix} +1 & i=j, \\, i \\in (1 \\ldots p) \\\\\n      -1 & i=j, \\, i \\in (p+1 \\ldots n) \\\\\n      - e_j e_i &  i \\not = j \\end{matrix}$$\n\nA space of spinors can be constructed explicitly. For a complete example\nin dimension 3, see spinors in three dimensions. There are two\ndifferent, but essentially equivalent, ways to proceed. One approach\nseeks to identify the minimal ideals for the left action of $Cl(V, g)$\non itself. These are subspaces of the Clifford algebra of the form\n$Cl(V, g)\\omega$, admitting the evident action of $Cl(V, g)$ by\nleft-multiplication: $c : x\\omega \\to cx\\omega$. There are two\nvariations on this theme: one can either find a primitive element\n$\\omega$ which is a nilpotent element of the Clifford algebra, or one\nwhich is an idempotent. The construction via nilpotent elements is more\nfundamental in the sense that an idempotent may then be produced from\nit. In this way, the spinor representations are identified with certain\nsubspaces of the Clifford algebra itself. The second approach is to\nconstruct a vector space using a distinguished subspace of $V$, and then\nspecify the action of the Clifford algebra externally to that vector\nspace.\n\nIn either approach, the fundamental notion is that of an isotropic\nline|isotropic subspace $W$. Each construction depends on an initial\nfreedom in choosing this subspace. In physical terms, this corresponds\nto the fact that there is no measurement protocol which can specify a\nbasis of the spin space, even should a preferred basis of $V$ already be\ngiven.\n\n[*This entry was adapted from the Wikipedia article as of May 10,\n2007.*]{}\n\nSee also: spin groups\n\n[1]{} E.
