  "definition": "Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $K$. A *linear functional* (or\n*linear form*) on $V$ is a linear mapping $\\phi\\colon V\\to K$, where $K$\nis thought of as a one-dimensional vector space over itself.\n\nThe collection of all linear functionals on $V$ can be made into a\nvector space by defining addition and scalar multiplication pointwise;\nthis vector space is called the dual space of $V$.\n\nThe term [*linear functional*]{} derives from the case where $V$ is a\nspace of functions (see the entry on ). Some authors restrict the term\nto this case.",
