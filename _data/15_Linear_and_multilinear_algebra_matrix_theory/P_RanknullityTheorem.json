  "statement": "Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over the same field. If\n$\\phi\\colon V\\to W$ is a linear mapping, then\n$$\\dim V = \\dim(\\ker\\phi) + \\dim(\\im\\phi).$$ In other words, the\ndimension of $V$ is equal to the of the and nullity of $\\phi$.\n\nNote that if $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then this (applied to the\ncanonical mapping $V\\to V/U$) says that $$\\dim V = \\dim U + \\dim(V/U),$$\nthat is, $$\\dim V = \\dim U + \\codim U,$$ where $\\codim$ denotes\ncodimension.\n\nAn alternative way of stating the rank-nullity theorem is by saying that\nif $$0\\to U\\to V\\to W\\to 0$$ is a short exact sequence of vector spaces,\nthen $$\\dim(V) = \\dim(U) + \\dim(W).$$ In fact, if\n$$0\\to V_1\\to\\cdots\\to V_n\\to 0$$ is an exact sequence of vector spaces,\nthen\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\floor{n/2}}V_{2i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ceiling{n/2}}V_{2i-1},$$\nthat is, the sum of the dimensions of even-numbered terms is the same as\nthe sum of the dimensions of the odd-numbered terms.",
