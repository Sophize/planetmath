  "definition": "Let $L:U\\rightarrow V$ be a linear mapping, and let $v\\in V$ be given.\nWhen both the domain $U$ and codomain $V$ are finite-dimensional, a\nlinear equation $$L(u)=v,$$ where $u\\in U$ is the unknown, can be solved\nby means of row reduction. To do so, we need to choose a basis\n$a_1,\\ldots, a_m$ of the domain $U$, and a basis $b_1,\\ldots, b_n$ of\nthe codomain $V$. Let $M$ be the $n\\times m$ transformation matrix of\n$L$ relative to these bases, and let $y\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^n$ be the\ncoordinate vector of $v$ relative to the basis of $V$. Expressing this\nin terms of matrix notation, we have $$\\begin{gathered}\n  {\\begin{bmatrix}L(a_1),\\ldots, L(a_m)\\end{bmatrix}} = \n{\\begin{bmatrix}b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\end{bmatrix}}\n{\\begin{bmatrix} \nM_{11} & \\ldots & M_{1m} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nM_{n1} & \\ldots & M_{nm}\\end{bmatrix}},\\\\\nv = {\\begin{bmatrix}b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\end{bmatrix}} {\\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n\\end{bmatrix}}\\end{gathered}$$\nWe can now restate the abstract linear equation as the matrix-vector\nequation $$Mx =y,$$ with $x\\in {\\mathbb{R}}^m$ unknown, or equivalently,\nas the following system of $n$ linear equations $$\\begin{array}{ccccl}\n  M_{11} x_1 + &\\cdots &+ M_{1m}\\, x_m &=& y_1 \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & &\\vdots\\\\\n  M_{n1} x_1  + &\\cdots&  + M_{nm}\\, x_m &=& y_n\n  \\end{array}$$ with $x_1,\\ldots, x_m$ unknown. Solutions $u\\in U$ of\nthe abstract linear equation $L(u)=v$ are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith solutions of the matrix-vector equation $Mx=y$. The correspondence\nis given by\n$$u = {\\begin{bmatrix}a_1,\\ldots, a_m\\end{bmatrix}} {\\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_m\\end{bmatrix}}.$$\n\nNote that the dimension of the domain is the number of variables, while\nthe dimension of the codomain is the number of equations. The equation\nis called under-determined or over-determined depending on whether the\nformer is greater than the latter, or vice versa. In general,\nover-determined systems are inconsistent, while under-determined ones\nhave multiple solutions. However, this is a \u201crule of thumb\u201d only, and\nexceptions are not hard to find. A full understanding of consistency,\nand multiple solutions relies on the notions of kernel, image, rank, and\nis described by the rank-nullity theorem.\n\n#### Remark.\n\nElementary applications exclusively on the coefficient matrix and the\nright-hand vector, and neglect to mention the underlying linear mapping.\nThis is unfortunate, because the concept of a linear equation is much\nmore general than the traditional notion of \u201cvariables and equations\u201d,\nand relies in an essential way on the idea of a linear mapping. See the\non polynomial as a case in point. Polynomial interpolation is a linear\nproblem, but one that is specified abstractly, rather than in terms of\nvariables and equations.",
