  "statement": "Let $k$ be a field and $V$ be a vector space over $k$. Recall that\n$$V^{*}=\\{f:V\\to k\\ |\\ f\\mbox{ is linear}\\}$$ denotes the dual space of\n$V$ (which is also a vector space over $k$).\n\n**Proposition**. Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces. Consider the map\n$\\phi: V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}\\to (V\\otimes W)^{*}$ such that\n$$\\phi(f\\otimes g)(v\\otimes w)=f(v)g(w).$$ Then $\\phi$ is a\nmonomorphism. Moreover if one of the spaces $V$, $W$ is finite\ndimensional, then $\\phi$ is an isomorphism.\n\n*Proof*. One can easily check that $\\phi$ is a well defined linear map,\nthus it is sufficient to show that $\\mathrm{Ker}(\\phi)=0$. So assume\nthat $F\\in V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$ is such that $\\phi(F)=0$. It is clear\nthat $F$ can be (uniquely) expressed in the form\n$$F=\\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_{i,j} f_{i}\\otimes g_{j},$$ where $(f_i)$ is a\nbasis of $V^{*}$, $(g_{j})$ is a basis of $W^{*}$ and\n$\\alpha_{i,j}\\in k$. Then for any $v\\in V$ and $w\\in W$ we have:\n$$0=\\phi(F)(v\\otimes w)=\\phi(\\sum_{i,j}\\alpha_{i,j} f_{i}\\otimes g_{j})(v\\otimes w)=$$\n$$=\\sum_{i,j}\\alpha_{i,j} \\phi(f_{i}\\otimes g_{j})(v\\otimes w)=\\sum_{i,j}\\alpha_{i,j} f_{i}(v) g_{j}(w).$$\nSince $w\\in W$ is arbitrary then we can write this equality in the form:\n$$0=\\sum_{i,j}\\alpha_{i,j}f_{i}(v)g_{j}=\\sum_{j} (\\sum_{i} \\alpha_{i,j}f_{i}(v))g_{j}$$\nand since $(g_{j})$ are linearly independent we obtain that\n$\\sum_{i}\\alpha_{i,j}f_{i}(v)=0$ for all $j$. Again since $v\\in V$ was\narbitrary we obtain that $\\sum_{i}\\alpha_{i,j}f_{i}=0$ for all $j$. Now\nsince $(f_{i})$ are linearly independent we obtain that $\\alpha_{i,j}=0$\nfor all $i,j$. Thus $F=0$.\n\nNow assume that $\\mathrm{dim}_{k}V=q<+\\infty$. Let $(v_i)_{i=1}^{q}$ be\na basis of $V$ and let $(v_{i}^{*})_{i=1}^{q}$ be an induced basis of\n$V^{*}$. Moreover let $(w_{p})_{p\\,\\in P}$ be a basis of $W$. We wish to\nshow that $\\phi$ is onto, so let $f:V\\otimes W\\to k$ be an element of\n$(V\\otimes W)^{*}$. Define $F\\in V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$ by the formula:\n$$F=\\sum_{i=1}^{q} v_{i}^{*}\\otimes g_{i},$$ where $g_{i}:W\\to k$ is\nsuch that $g_{i}(w_{p})=f(v_i \\otimes w_p)$. Then for any $v_j$ from\n$(v_i)_{i=1}^{q}$ and for any $w_p$ from $(w_{p})_{p\\,\\in P}$ we have:\n$$\\phi(F)(v_j\\otimes w_p)=\\phi(\\sum_{i=1}^{q} v_{i}^{*}\\otimes g_{i})(v_j\\otimes w_p)=\\sum_{i=1}^{q}\\phi(v_{i}^{*}\\otimes g_{i})(v_j \\otimes w_p)=$$\n$$=\\sum_{i=1}^{q}v_{i}^{*}(v_{j})g_{i}(w_p)=g_{j}(w_p)=f(v_j\\otimes w_p)$$\nand thus $\\phi(F)=f$. $\\square$\n\n**Remark**. The map $\\phi$ from the previous proposition is very\nimportant in studying algebras and coalgebras (more precisly it is an\nessence in defining dual (co)algebras). Unfortunetly $\\phi$ does not\nhave to be an isomorphism in general. Nevertheless, the spaces\n$(V\\otimes W)^{*}$ and $V^{*}\\otimes W^{*}$ are always isomorphic (see\nfor more details).",
