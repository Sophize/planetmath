  "definition": "A [*matrix*]{} is an array, or a rectangular grid, of numbers. An $m\n\\times n$ matrix is one which has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Examples of\nmatrices include:\n\n-   The $2 \\times 3$ matrix $$A =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & -2 & 2 \\\\\n    1 & 0 & 2\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n-   The $3 \\times 3$ matrix $$B =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n    4 & 2 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n-   The $3 \\times 1$ matrix $$C =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    7 \\\\\n    7 \\\\\n    2\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n-   The $1 \\times 2$ matrix $$D =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\frac{1}{2} & 2\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nAll of our example matrices (except the last one) have entries which are\nintegers. In general, matrices are allowed to have their entries taken\nfrom any ring $R$. The set of all $m \\times n$ matrices with entries in\na ring $R$ is denoted $M_{m \\times n}(R)$. If a matrix has exactly as\nmany rows as it has columns, we say it is a square matrix.\n\nAddition of two matrices is allowed provided that both matrices have the\nsame number of rows and the same number of columns. The sum of two such\nmatrices is obtained by adding their respective entries. For example,\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 \\\\\n7 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n4.5 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 + (-1) \\\\\n7 + 4.5 \\\\\n2 + 0\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n11.5 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nMultiplication of two matrices is allowed provided that the number of\ncolumns of the first matrix equals the number of rows of the second\nmatrix. (For example, multiplication of a $2 \\times 3$ matrix with a $3\n\\times 3$ is allowed, but multiplication of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix with a\n$2 \\times 3$ matrix is not allowed, since the first matrix has 3\ncolumns, and the second matrix has 2 rows, and 3 doesn\u2019t equal 2.) In\nthis case the matrix multiplication is defined by\n$$(AB)_{ij}=\\sum_k (A)_{ik} (B)_{kj}\\;.$$\n\nWe will describe how matrix multiplication works is with an example. Let\n$$A =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix},\\ \\ \\ \\\nB =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ be the two matrices that we used above as our very first\ntwo examples of matrices. Since $A$ is a $2 \\times 3$ matrix, and $B$ is\na $3 \\times 3$ matrix, it is legal to multiply $A$ and $B$, but it is\nnot legal to multiply $B$ and $A$. The method for computing the product\n$AB$ is to place $A$ below and to the left of $B$, as follows:\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n& \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} &\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nX & Y & \\ \\ \\\\\n\\ \\ &\\ \\ &\\ \\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{matrix}$$ $A$ is always in the bottom left corner, $B$ is in the\ntop right corner, and the product, $AB$, is always in the bottom right\ncorner. We see from the picture that $AB$ will be a $2 \\times 3$ matrix.\n(In general, $AB$ has as many rows as $A$, and as many columns as $B$.)\n\nLet us compute the top left entry of $AB$, denoted by $X$ in the above\npicture. The way to calculate this entry of $AB$ (or any other entry) is\nto take the dot product of the stuff above it \\[which is $(1,3,4)$\\] and\nthe stuff to the left of it \\[which is $(1,-2,2)$\\]. In this case, we\nhave $$X = 1 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot (-2) + 4 \\cdot 2 = 3.$$ Similarly, the\ntop middle entry of $AB$ (where the $Y$ is in the above picture) is\ngotten by taking the dot product of the stuff above it: $(0,-1,2)$, and\nthe stuff to the left of it: $(1,-2,2)$, which gives\n$$Y = 0\\cdot 1 + (-1) \\cdot (-2) + 2 \\cdot 2 = 6$$\n\nContinuing in this way, we can compute every entry of $AB$ one by one to\nget $$\\begin{matrix}\n& \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} &\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 6 & -9 \\\\\n9 & 4 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{matrix}$$ and so $$AB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 6 & -9 \\\\\n9 & 4 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$ If one tries to compute the [**illegal**]{} product\n$BA$ using this procedure, one winds up with $$\\begin{matrix}\n& \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n3 & -1 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} &\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n?\\ &\\ \\ & \\ \\ \\\\\n\\ \\ &\\ \\ & \\ \\ \\\\\n\\ \\ &\\ \\ & \\ \\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{matrix}$$ The top left entry of this illegal product (marked with a\n$?$ above) would have to be the dot product of the stuff above it:\n$(1,1)$, and the stuff to the left of it: $(1,0,1)$, but these vectors\ndo not have the same length, so it is impossible to take their dot\nproduct, and consequently it is impossible to take the product of the\nmatrices $BA$.\n\nUnder the correspondence of matrices and linear transformations, one can\nshow that matrix multiplication is equivalent to composition of linear\ntransformations, which explains why matrix multiplication is defined in\na manner which is so odd at first sight, and why this strange manner of\nmultiplication is so useful in mathematics.",
