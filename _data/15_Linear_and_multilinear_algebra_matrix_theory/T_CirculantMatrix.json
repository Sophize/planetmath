  "definition": "A square matrix $M:A\\times A\\to C$ is said to be $g$-*circulant* for an\ninteger $g$ if each row other than the first is obtained from the\npreceding row by shifting the elements cyclically g columns to the right\n(g&gt;0) or -g columns to the left (g &lt; 0).\n\nThat is, if $A=[a_{ij}]$ then $a_{i,j} = a_{i+1,j+g}$ where the\nsubscripts are computed modulo d. A 1-circulant is commonly called a\ncirculant and a -1-circulant is called a back circulant.\n\nMore explicitly, a matrix of the form $$\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\nM_1 & M_2 & M_3 &\\ldots & M_{d} \\\\\nM_d & M_1 & M_2 & \\ldots & M_{d-1}\\\\\nM_{d-1} & M_d & M_1 & \\ldots & M_{d-2}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots& \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nM_2 & M_3 & M_4 & \\ldots & M_1\n\\end{array}\\right]$$ is called circulant.\n\nBecause the of a circulant matrix is rather simple, circulant matrices\nhave some interest in connection with the approximation of eigenvalues\nof more general matrices. In particular, they have become part of the\nstandard apparatus in the computerized analysis of signals and images.",
