  "definition": "The definition of determinant as a multilinear mapping on rows can be\nmodified to provide a basis-free definition of determinant. In order to\nmake it clear that we are not using bases. we shall speak in terms of an\nendomorphism of a vector space over $k$ rather than speaking of a matrix\nwhose entries belong to $k$. We start by recalling some preliminary\nfacts.\n\nSuppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension $n$ over a\nfield $k$. Recall that a multilinear map $f\\colon V^n\\to k$ is\nalternating if $f(x) = 0$ whenever there exist distinct indices\n$i,j\\in[n]=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ such that $x_i = x_j$. Every alternating map\n$f\\colon V^n\\to k$ is skew-symmetric, that is, for each permutation\n$\\pi\\in\\mathfrak{S}_n$, we have that $f(x) =\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)f(x^{\\pi})$, where $x^{\\pi}$ denotes\n$(x_{\\pi(i)})_{i\\in[n]}$, the result of $\\pi$ permuting the entries of\n$x$.\n\nSince the trivial map $0\\colon V^n\\to k$ is alternating and any linear\ncombination of alternating maps is alternating, it follows that\nalternating maps form a subspace of the space of multilinear maps. In\nthe following proposition we show that this subspace is one-dimensional.\n\nSuppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension $n$ over a\nfield $k$. Then the space of alternating maps from $V^n$ to $k$ is\none-dimensional.\n\nWe use a basis here, but we will throw it away later. We need the basis\nhere because each map we will consider has exactly as many elements as a\nbasis of $V$. So let $B = \\{b_i\\colon i\\in[n]\\}$ be a basis of $V$.\n\nSuppose $f$ and $g$ are nontrivial alternating maps from $V^n$ to $k$.\nWe claim that $f$ and $g$ are linearly dependent. Let $x\\in V^n$. We may\nassume that the entries of $x$ are basis vectors, that is, that $X\n= \\{x_i\\colon i\\in[n]\\}\\subset\\{b_i\\colon i\\in[n]\\}$. If\n$X\\subsetneq B$, then there exist distinct indices $i,j\\in[n]$ such that\n$x_i = x_j$. Since $f$ and $g$ are alternating, it follows that\n$f(x) = g(x) = 0$, which implies that $f(b)g(x) = g(b)f(x)$. On the\nother hand, if $X = B$, then there is a permutation\n$\\pi\\in\\mathfrak{S}_n$ such that $x = b^{\\pi}$. Since $f$ and $g$ are\nskew-symmetric, it follows that\n$$f(b)g(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)f(b)g(b) = g(b)f(x).$$ In either\ncase we find that $f(b) g(x) = g(b) f(x)$. Since $f(b)$ and $g(b)$ are\nfixed scalars, it follows that $f$ and $g$ are linearly dependent.\n\nSo far we have shown only that the dimension of the space of alternating\nmaps is less than or equal to one. In order to show that the space is\none-dimensional we simply need to find a nontrivial alternating form. To\ndo this, let $\\{b^*_i\\colon i\\in[n]\\}$ be the natural basis of $V^*$, so\nthat $b^*_i(b_j)$ is the Kronecker delta of $i$ and $j$ for any\n$i,j\\in[n]$. Define a map $f\\colon V^n\\to k$ by\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{\\pi\\in\\mathfrak{S}_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)\\prod_{i\\in[n]} b^*_i(x_{\\pi(i)}).$$\nOne can check that $f$ is multilinear and alternating. Moreover,\n$f(b) = 1$, so it is nontrivial. Hence the space of alternating maps is\none-dimensional.\n\nFor an alternate view of the above results, we could look instead at\nlinear maps from the exterior product $\\bigwedge^n V$ into $k$. The\nproposition above can be viewed as saying that the dimension of\n$\\bigwedge^n V$ is $\\displaystyle\\binom{n}{n} = 1$.\n\nWe define the determinant of an endomorphism in terms of the action of\nthe endomorphism on alternating maps. Recall that if $M\\colon V\\to V$ is\nan endomorphism, its pullback $M^*$ is the unique operator such that\n$$(M^*f)(x_i)_{i\\in [n]} = f(M(x_i))_{i\\in [n]}.$$ Since the space of\nalternating maps is one-dimensional and endomorphisms of a\none-dimensional space reduce to scalar multiplication, it follows that\n$M^*f$ is a scalar multiple of $f$. We call this scalar the determinant.\nIt is well-defined because the scalar depends on $M$ but not on $f$.\n\nSuppose $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension $n$ over a\nfield $k$, and let $M\\colon V\\to V$ be an endomorphism. Then the\n*determinant* of $M$ is the unique scalar $\\det(M)$ such that\n$$M^* f = \\det(M) f$$ for all alternating maps $f\\colon V^n\\to k$.",
