  "definition": "A Hadamard matrix $H$ is *skew Hadamard* if $H+H^T=2I$.\n\nA collection of skew Hadamard matrices, including at least one example\nof every order $n \\le 100$ and also including every equivalence class of\norder $\\le 28$, is available . It has been conjectured that one exists\nfor every positive order divisible by 4.\n\nReid and Brown in 1972 showed that there exists a \u201cdoubly regular\ntournament of order n\u201d if and only if there exists a skew Hadamard\nmatrix of order n+1.\n\n[9]{} S.
