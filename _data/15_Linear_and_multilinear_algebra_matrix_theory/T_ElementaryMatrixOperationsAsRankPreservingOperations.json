  "definition": "Let $M$ be a matrix over a division ring $D$. An *elementary operation*\non $M$ is any one of the eight operations below:\n\n[2]{}\n\n1.  exchanging two rows\n\n2.  exchanging two columns\n\n3.  adding one row to another\n\n4.  adding one column to another\n\n5.  right multiplying a non-zero scalar to a row\n\n6.  left multiplying a non-zero scalar to a row\n\n7.  right multiplying a non-zero scalar to a column\n\n8.  left multiplying a non-zero scalar to a column\n\nWe want to determine the effects of these operations on the various\nranks of $M$. To facilitate this discussion, let $M=(a_{ij})$ be an\n$n\\times m$ matrix and $M'=(b_{ij})$ be the matrix after an application\nof one of the operations above to $M$. In addition, let\n$v_i=(a_{i1},\\cdots, v_{im})$ be the $i$-th row of $M$, and\n$w_i=(b_{i1},\\cdots, b_{im})$ be the $i$-th row of $M'$. In other words,\n$$M=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \nv_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{11} & \\cdots & a_{1m} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \na_{n1} & \\cdots & a_{nm}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\xrightarrow[\\textrm{operation}]{\\textrm{elementary}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb_{11} & \\cdots & b_{1m} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \nb_{n1} & \\cdots & b_{nm}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nw_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \nw_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\nM'$$ Finally, let $d$ be the left row rank of $M$.\n\nRow and column exchanges preserve all ranks of $M$.\n\nClearly, exchanging two rows of $M$ do not change the subspace generated\nby the rows of $M$, and therefore $d$ is preserved.\n\nAs exchanging rows do not affect $d$, let us assume that rows have been\nexchanged so that the first $d$ rows of $M$ are left linearly\nindependent.\n\nNow, let $M'$ be obtained from $M$ by exchanging columns $i$ and $j$. So\n$w_1,\\ldots, w_n$ are vectors obtained respectively from\n$v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ by exchanging the $i$-th and $j$-th coordinates.\nSuppose $r_1w_1+\\cdots + r_dw_d=0$. Then we get an equation\n$r_1b_{1k}+\\cdots + r_d b_{dk}=0$ for $1\\le k\\le m$. Rearranging these\nequations, we see that $r_1v_1 + \\cdots + r_dv_d=0$, which implies\n$r_1=\\cdots = r_d =0$, showing that $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$ are left linearly\nindependent. This means that $d$ is preserved by column exchanges.\n\nPreservation of other ranks of $M$ are similarly proved.\n\nAdditions of rows and columns preserve all ranks of $M$.\n\nLet $M'$ be the matrix obtained from $M$ by replacing row $i$ by vector\n$v_i+v_j$, and let $V'$ be the left vector space spanned by the rows of\n$M'$. Since $v_i+v_j\\in V$, we have $V'\\subseteq V$. On other hand,\n$v_i=(v_i+v_j)-v_j \\in V'$, so $V\\subseteq V'$, and hence $V=V'$.\n\nNext, let $w_1,\\ldots, w_n$ be vectors obtained respectively from\n$v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ such that the $i$-th coordinate of $w_k$ is the sum of\nthe $i$-th coordinate of $v_k$ and the $j$-th coordinate of $v_k$, with\nall other coordinates remain the same. Again, by renumbering if\nnecessary, let $v_1,\\ldots, v_d$ be left linearly independent. Suppose\n$r_1w_1 + \\cdots + r_iw_i+ \\cdots + r_dw_d = 0$. A similar argument like\nin the previous proposition shows that\n$r_1v_1+\\cdots + (r_i+r_j)v_j + r_dv_d = 0$, which implies\n$r_1 =\\cdots = r_i+r_j = \\cdots r_d = 0$. Since $r_i=0$, $r_j=0$ too.\nThis shows that $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$ are left linearly independent, which\nmeans that $d$ is preserved by additions of columns.\n\nPreservation of other ranks of $M$ are proved similarly.\n\nLeft (right) non-zero row scalar multiplication preserves left (right)\nrow rank of $M$; left (right) non-zero column scalar multiplications\npreserves left (right) column rank of $M$.\n\nLet $w_1,\\ldots, w_n$ be vectors obtained respectively from\n$v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ such that the $i$-th vector $w_i=rv_i$, where\n$0\\ne r\\in D$, and all other $w_j$\u2019s are the same as the $v_j$\u2019s. Assume\nthat the first $d$ rows of $M$ are left linearly independent, and that\n$i\\le d$. Suppose $r_1w_1+\\cdots + r_dw_d=0$. Then\n$r_1v_1+ \\cdots + r_i(rv_i) + \\cdots r_dv_d = 0$, which implies\n$r_1 = \\cdots = r_ir = \\cdots = r_d = 0$. Since $r\\ne 0$, $r_i=0$, and\ntherefore $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$ are left linearly independent.\n\nThe others are proved similarly.\n\nLeft (right) non-zero row scalar multiplication preserves right (left)\ncolumn rank of $M$; left (right) non-zero column scalar multiplication\npreserves right (left) row rank of $M$.\n\nLet us prove that right multiplying a column by a non-zero scalar $r$\npreserves the left row rank $d$ of $M$. The others follow similarly.\n\nLet $w_1,\\ldots, w_n$ be vectors obtained respectively from\n$v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ such that the $i$-th coordinate $b_{ik}$ of $w_k$ is\n$a_{ik}r$, where $a_{ik}$ is the $i$-th coordinate of $v_k$. Suppose\nonce again that the first $d$ rows of $M$ are left linearly independent,\nand suppose $r_1w_1 + \\cdots + r_dw_d=0$. Then for each coordinate $j$\nwe get an equation $r_1b_{1j}+\\cdots + r_d b_{dj}=0$. In particular, for\nthe $i$-th coordinate, we have $r_1a_{1j}r+\\cdots + r_d a_{dj}r=0$.\nSince $r\\ne 0$, right multiplying the equation by $r^{-1}$ gives us\n$r_1a_{1j}+\\cdots + r_d a_{dj}=0$. Re-collecting all the equations, we\nget $r_1v_1+\\cdots +r_dw_d=0$, which implies that\n$r_1= \\cdots = r_d = 0$, or that $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$ are left linearly\nindependent.",
