  "definition": "Permutation Matrix\n==================\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer. A *permutation matrix* is any $n\\times n$\nmatrix which can be created by rearranging the rows and/or columns of\nthe $n\\times n$ identity matrix. More formally, given a permutation\n$\\pi$ from the symmetric group $S_n$, one can define an $n\\times n$\npermutation matrix $P_{\\pi}$ by $P_{\\pi}=(\\delta_{i\\, \\pi(j)})$, where\n$\\delta$ denotes the Kronecker delta symbol.\n\nPremultiplying an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n\\times n$ permutation\nmatrix results in a rearrangement of the rows of $A$. For example, if\nthe matrix $P$ is obtained by swapping rows $i$ and $j$ of the\n$n \\times n$ identity matrix, then rows $i$ and $j$ of $A$ will be\nswapped in the product $PA$.\n\nPostmultiplying an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n\\times n$ permutation\nmatrix results in a rearrangement of the columns of $A$.
