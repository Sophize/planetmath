  "definition": "In this entry, we work within a Euclidean space $E$.\n\n1.  Two non-zero Euclidean vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are said to\n    be [*parallel*]{}, denoted by $\\vec{a}\\parallel\\vec{b}$, iff there\n    exists a real number $k$ such that $$\\vec{a} = k\\vec{b}.$$\n\n    Since both $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are non-zero, $k\\neq 0$. So\n    $\\parallel$ is a binary relation on on\n    $E\\!\\smallsetminus\\!\\lbrace\\vec{0}\\rbrace$ and called the\n    [*parallelism*]{}. If $k > 0$, then $a$ and $b$ are said to be in\n    the *same direction*, and we denote this by\n    $\\vec{a}\\upuparrows\\vec{b}$; if $k < 0$, then $a$ and $b$ are said\n    to be in the *opposite* or *contrary directions*, and we denote this\n    by $\\vec{a}\\downarrow\\uparrow\\vec{b}$.\n\n    **Remarks**\n\n    -   Actually, the parallelism is an equivalence relation on\n        $E\\!\\smallsetminus\\!\\lbrace\\vec{0}\\rbrace$. If the zero vector\n        $\\vec{0}$ were allowed along, then the relation were not\n        symmetric ($\\vec{0} = 0\\vec{b}$ but not necessarily\n        $\\vec{b} = k\\vec{0}$).\n\n    -   When two vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are not parallel to one\n        another, written $\\vec{a}\\nparallel\\vec{b}$, they are said to be\n        [*diverging*]{}.\n\n2.  Two Euclidean vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are\n    [*perpendicular*]{}, denoted by $\\vec{a}\\perp\\vec{b}$, iff\n    $$\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = 0,$$ i.e. iff their scalar product vanishes.\n    Then $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are [*normal vectors*]{} of each other.\n\n    **Remarks**\n\n    -   We may say that $\\vec{0}$ is perpendicular to all vectors,\n        because its direction is and because $\\vec{0}\\cdot\\vec{b} = 0$.\n\n    -   Perpendicularity is not an equivalence relation in the set of\n        all vectors of the space in question, since it is neither\n        reflexive nor transitive.\n\n3.  The angle $\\theta$ between two non-zero vectors $\\vec{a}$ and\n    $\\vec{b}$ is obtained from\n    $$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}{|\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|}.$$ The\n    angle is chosen so that $0 \\leqq \\theta \\leqq \\pi$.",
