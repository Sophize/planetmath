  "definition": "Introductory remarks.\n=====================\n\nWe begin with some informal remarks to motivate the formal definitions\nfound in the next section. Throughout, $V$ is a vector space over a\nfield $K$. Many of the concepts and constructions discussed below apply\nverbatim to modules over commutative rings, but we will stick to vector\nspaces to keep things simple.\n\nThe exterior product, commonly denoted by the wedge symbol $\\wedge$ and\nalso known as the wedge product, is an antisymmetric variant of the\ntensor product. The former, like the latter is an associative, bilinear\noperation. Thus, for all $u,v\\in V$ and $a,b,c,d\\in K$, we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\label{eq:aubvwedge}\n  (au+bv) \\wedge (cu + dv ) &= ac\\, (u\\wedge u) + ad\\, (u\\wedge v) + bc\\,   (v\\wedge u)\n  + bd\\, (v\\wedge v)\\\\\n  \\label{eq:aubvotimes}\n  (au+bv) \\otimes (cu + dv ) &= ac\\, (u\\otimes u) + ad\\, (u\\otimes v) + bc\\,\n  (v\\otimes u)   + bd\\, (v\\otimes v).\\end{aligned}$$ The essential\ndifference between the two operations is that all squares formed using\nthe exterior product vanish, by definition. Thus, $$\\label{eq:vvzero}\n  v\\wedge v =0,$$ whereas $v\\otimes v\\neq 0$. Hence, the expressions in\nare equal to $(ad-bc) u\\wedge v$, but there is no way to simplify\nfurther the right-hand side of .\n\nA polarization argument shows that for $u,v\\in V$ we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  0 &= (u+v)\\wedge (u+v) \\\\& = u\\wedge u + u\\wedge v + v\\wedge u +\n  v\\wedge\n  v\\\\\n  &= u\\wedge v + v\\wedge u.\\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, if the of the\nunderlying field $K$ is not equal to $2$, that is if $1+1\\neq 0$, then\nthe key postulate is logically equivalent to the antisymmetry condition\n$$\\label{eq:antisym}\n  u\\wedge v = -v\\wedge u,\\quad u,v\\in V.$$ However, if the\ncharacteristic is 2, that is if $K$ is a field where $1=-1$, then does\nnot, necessarily, follow from . Therefore, to keep things as general as\npossible, we must use to formulate the essential identity satisfied by\nthe exterior product.\n\nSo far so good, but we have not yet given a meaning to the symbol\n$u\\wedge v$. The geometric interpretation of $u\\wedge v$ is that of an\noriented area element in the plane spanned by $u$ and $v$. Without\nadditional structure, there is no way to assign a area measurement to a\nparallelogram in a vector space. However, parallelograms that lie in the\nsame plane are commensurate. If we adopt the parallelogram spanned by\n$u$ and $v$ as the standard area, we can say that the oriented area of\nanother parallelogram, say one that is spanned by $au+bv$ and $cu+dv$,\nhas an area that is $ad-bc$ times the area of the first parallelogram.\nThe exterior product allows us to express this algebraically. To wit,\n$$(au+bv)\\wedge(cu+dv) = (ad-bc) (u\\wedge v),\\quad u,v\\in V,\\;\na,b,c,d\\in K.$$ The analogous interpretation for vectors is that of an\noriented length element on a line. For this reason, the object\n$u\\wedge v$ is referred to as a bivector.\n\nFrom a more algebraic point of view, a bivector $u\\wedge v$ can be\nconsidered as a formal antisymmetric product of vectors $u$ and $v$, in\nmuch the same way that $u\\otimes v$ can be regarded as a formal\nnon-commutative product of two vectors. Such descriptions can hardly\nserve as rigorous definitions, but an explicit construction is not\nreally the way to go here.\n\nTake the case of the tensor product. Formal sums of formal products\n$u\\otimes v$, where $u,v\\in V$, form a certain vector space, which we\ndenote as $V\\otimes V$. However, rather than saying that $V\\otimes V$\n**is** such and such a thing, it is better to state a certain universal\nproperty that describes $V\\otimes V$ up to vector space isomorphism. The\nproperty in question is that every **bilinear** map $f:V\\times V\\to W$\ndetermines a unique **linear** map from $g:V\\otimes V\\to W$ such that\n$$f(u,v) = g(u\\otimes v),\\quad u,v \\in V.$$ Similarly, formal sums of\nbivectors constitute a vector space $\\Lambda^2(V)$, called the second\nexterior power of $V$. This vector space is defined, up to isomorphism,\nby the condition that every antisymmetric, bilinear map\n$f:V\\times V\\to W$ determines a unique linear map $g:\\Lambda^2(V) \\to\nW$ with $$f(u,v) = g(u\\wedge v).$$ Thus, in the same way that the tensor\nproduct replaces bilinear maps with a certain kind of linear map, the\nexterior product replaces bilinear, antisymmetric maps with linear maps\nfrom $\\Lambda^2 V$.\n\nMore generally, $k$-multivectors are $k$-fold products\n$v_1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge v_k$, and the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ exterior power,\n$\\Lambda^k(V)$, is the vector space of formal sums of $k$-multivectors.\nThe product of a $k$-multivector and an $\\ell$-multivector is a\n$(k+\\ell)$-multivector. So, the direct sum $\\bigoplus_k \\Lambda^k(V)$\nforms an associative algebra, which is closed with respect to the wedge\nproduct. This algebra, commonly denoted by $\\Lambda(V)$, is called the\nexterior algebra of $V$.\n\nAgain, the analogy with the tensor product is useful. The tensor algebra\n$T(V)$ can be characterized as the associative, non-commutative algebra\nfreely generated by $V$. If the characteristic of $k$ is not 2, then the\nwedge product satisfies the supercommutativity relations\n$$\\alpha\\wedge \\beta = (-1)^{k+\\ell} \\beta\\wedge\\alpha,\\quad\n\\alpha\\in\\Lambda^k(V),\\; \\beta\\in\\Lambda^\\ell(V).$$ Thus, $\\Lambda(V)$\ncan be characterized as the supercommutative algebra which is freely\ngenerated by $V$.\n\nFormal definitions.\n===================\n\n#### Supercommutative algebras.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we define a supercommutative\nalgebra to be an associative, unital $K$-algebra $A$ with an\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$-grading, $A=A^+\\oplus A^-$, such that for all odd\n$a\\in A^-$ we have $$a^2 = 0,$$ and such that for all even $b\\in A^+$\nand all $a\\in A$, we have $$ab = ba.$$ Using a polarization argument we\nsee that the first condition implies that for all odd $a,b\\in A^-$ we\nhave $$ab = -ba.$$ If the characteristic of $K$ is different from $2$,\nthen the converse is true, and we recover the usual definition of\nsupercommutativity, namely that\n$$ab = \\pm ba,\\quad a\\in A^{\\pm},\\; b\\in A^{\\pm},$$ with the minus sign\nemployed if both $a$ and $b$ or odd, and with $+$ employed otherwise.\n\n#### Exterior algebra.\n\nLet $E$ be a supercommutative algebra and $\\iota:V\\to E^-$ a linear map.\nWe will say that $(E,\\iota)$ is a model for the exterior algebra of $V$,\nif every linear map $f:V\\to A^-$, where $A$ a supercommutative algebra,\nto a unique algebra homomorphism $g:E\\to A$, where \u201clifts\u201d means that\n$f = g\\circ\\iota$. Diagrammatically:\n\n![image](extalg){width=\"4cm\"}\n\nThe above condition on $E$ is a universal property; this implies that\nall models are isomorphic as algebras. Thus, when we speak of\n$\\Lambda(V)$, the exterior algebra of $V$, we are referring to the\nisomorphism class of all such models. It is also common to identify $V$\nwith its image $\\iota(V)$, and to write $v$ rather than $\\iota(v)$.\n\n#### Exterior powers.\n\nFor the purposes of the present entry, we define an antisymmetric map to\nbe a $k$-multilinear map $f:V^{\\times k}\\to W$ such that $f(\\dots,\nv,v,\\dots)=0$ for all $v\\in V$. A polarization argument then implies the\nusual antisymmetry condition, namely that for every permutation $\\pi$ of\n$\\{ 1,2,\\dots, k\\}$ we have\n$$f(v_{\\pi_1},\\dots, v_{\\pi_k}) = {\\operatorname{sgn}}(\\pi) f(v_1,\\dots, v_k),\\quad\nv_1,\\dots,v_k \\in V.$$ As usual, if the characteristic of $K$ is\ndifferent from $2$, the two assertions are equivalent. However if\n$1=-1$, then the first assertion is stronger, and that is why we adopt\nit as the definition of antisymmetry.\n\nWe now define a model of the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ exterior power of $V$ to\nbe a vector space $E^k$ and an antisymmetric map\n$\\wedge: V^{\\times k}\\to E^k$ such that every antisymmetric map\n$f:V^{\\times\n  k}\\to W$ lifts to a unique linear map $g:E^k\\to W$, where \u201clifts\u201d\nmeans that $$f(v_1,\\dots,v_k) = g(v_1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge v_k),\\quad\nv_1,\\dots,v_k\\in V.$$ As above, all models are isomorphic as vector\nspaces, and we use $\\Lambda^k(V)$ to denote the isomorphism class of all\nsuch.\n\n#### The standard model.\n\nA model of the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(V)$, and the exterior powers\n$\\Lambda^k(V)$ can be easily constructed as the antisymmetrized\nquotients of the tensor algebra\n$$T(V)=\\bigoplus_{k=0}^\\infty V^{\\otimes k},\\qquad V^{\\otimes k} =\nV\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes V \\text{ (k times)}.$$ To that end, let $S(V)$\ndenote the two sided ideal of $T(V)$ generated by elements of the form\n$v\\otimes v,\\; v\\in V$. Then\n\n$$S(V)=\\bigoplus_{k=0}^\\infty S^k(V),\\qquad  \\textrm{where} \\quad S^k(V)=S(V)\\cap\nV^{\\otimes k},$$ and let\n$$E(V)=T(V)/S(V),\\qquad E^k(V)=V^{\\otimes k}/S^k(V)$$ denote the\nindicated quotients, with $a:T(V)\\to E(V)$ and $a_k: V^{\\otimes k} \\to\nE^k(V)$ denoting the corresponding antisymmetrization surjections. It is\neasy to see that $S^1(V)$ is the trivial vector space, and hence that\n$E^1(V) \\cong V$. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that\n$E^k(V),\\; k\\geq 2$ is a model of the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ exterior power,\nwhile $E(V)$ together with the map $V\\to E^1(V)$ is a model of the full\nexterior algebra.\n\n#### The canonical grading.\n\nAn inspection of the above construction reveals that\n$$E(V) = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^\\infty E^k(V).$$ Indeed, every model of\nexterior algebra carries a canonical grading. Let $E$ be a particular\nmodel of the exterior algebra of $V$. For $k=1,2,\\dots$, we will call\n$\\alpha\\in E$, a $k$-primitive element if $\\alpha =\nv_1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge v_k,$ for some $v_i\\in V$. We now let\n$E^k\\subset E$ denote the vector space spanned by all $k$-primitive\nelements, and let $E^0=K$.\n\nThe subspace $E^k$ is a model for the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ exterior power\nof $V$. Furthermore, $$E = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^\\infty E^k.$$\n\n#### Categorical formulation.\n\nThe above definition of exterior product has a very appealing\ncategorical formulation. Let ${\\mathbb{S}}$ denote the category of\nsupercommutative $K$-algebras, let ${\\mathbb{V}}$ denote category of\nvector spaces over $K$, and let $(\\cdot)^-:{\\mathbb{S}}\\to{\\mathbb{V}}$\ndenote the forgetful functor $A\\mapsto A^-$. We may now say that the\nexterior algebra function $\\Lambda:{\\mathbb{V}}\\to{\\mathbb{S}}$ is the\nleft adjoint of $(\\cdot)^-$. In other words,\n$${\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathbb{V}}}(V,A^-) \\cong {\\operatorname{Hom}}_{{\\mathbb{S}}}(\\Lambda(V), A),\\quad V\\in{\\mathbb{V}},\\; A\\in {\\mathbb{S}},$$\nwith the isomorphism natural in $V$ and $A$.\n\nIt is useful to compare the above definition to the categorical\ndefinition of the tensor algebra. Let ${\\mathbb{A}}$ denote the category\nof associative, unital $K$-algebras, and let\n$F:{\\mathbb{A}}\\to{\\mathbb{V}}$ be the forgetful functor that gives the\nunderlying vector space structure of a $K$-algebra. We can then define\nthe tensor algebra $T(V)$ of a vector space $V$ by saying that\n$T:{\\mathbb{V}}\\to{\\mathbb{A}}$ is the left-adjoint of\n$F:{\\mathbb{A}}\\to{\\mathbb{V}}$. Thus, whereas $T(V)$ as the\n**associative algebra** freely generated by $V$, the exterior algebra\n$\\Lambda(V)$ is the **supercommutative algebra** freely generated by\n$V$. The antisymmetrization quotient map $a_V\\colon T(V)\\to\\Lambda(V)$\nis a natural transformation between these two functors.\n\nFinite dimensional models.\n==========================\n\n#### Basis models.\n\nIf $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space, there are some down-to-earth\nconstructions of $\\Lambda(V)$ that go a long way to illuminate the\nnature of the exterior product. Suppose then, that $V$ is\n$n$-dimensional, and let $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$ be a basis of $V$. For every\nascending sequence $$0\\leq i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_k\\leq n$$ let us introduce\nthe symbol $e_I=e_{i_1\\dots i_k}$ to represent the primitive\n$k$-multivector $e_{i_1}\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge e_{i_k}$. If $I$ is the empty\nsequence, we let $e_I$ denote the unit element of the field $K$.\n\nThe $\\binom{n}{k}$-dimensional vector space spanned by $e_{i_1\\dots\n    i_k}$ is a model of $\\Lambda^k(V)$.\n\nNote that $\\Lambda^1(V)$ is just the $n$-dimensional space spanned by\nthe basis symbols $e_1,\\dots,e_n$. As such, $\\Lambda^1(V)$ is naturally\nisomorphic to $V$. For disjoint sequences $I$ and $J$, let us define\n$$e_I \\wedge e_J = {\\operatorname{sgn}}(IJ) e_{[IJ]},$$ where $[IJ]$\ndenotes the ascending sequence composed of the union of $I$ and $J$, and\nwhere ${\\operatorname{sgn}}(IJ)=\\pm 1$ denotes the parity of the\npermutation that takes the sorted list $[IJ]$ to the unsorted\nconcatenation $IJ$. If $I$ and $J$ have one or more elements in common,\nwe define $$e_I\\wedge e_J = 0.$$ Here are some examples:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n  &e_{3} \\wedge e_{12} = e_{123},\\\\\n  &e_{2}\\wedge e_{14} = - e_{124},\\\\\n  &e_{14} \\wedge e_{23} = e_{1234},\\\\\n  &e_{24} \\wedge e_{13} = -e_{1234},\\\\\n  &e_{24} \\wedge e_{14} =0.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe $2^n$ dimensional vector spanned by the symbols $e_I$, together with\nthe above product and the linear isomorphism from $V$ to $\\Lambda^1(V)$\nis a model of the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(V)$.\n\nEvidently, any list of numbers between $1$ and $n$ with length greater\nthan $n$ will contain duplicates. Thus, an immediate consequence of this\nconstruction is that $\\Lambda^k(V)=0$ for $k>n$, and hence that\n$$\\Lambda(V) = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^n \\Lambda^n(V).$$\n\n#### Alternating forms.\n\nIf $V$ is finite-dimensional, we have the natural isomorphism between\n$V$ and the double-dual $V^{**}$. We can exploit this natural\nisomorphism to construct the following model of exterior algebra. Let\n$A^k(V)$ denote the vector space of $k$-multilinear mappings from\n$(V^*)\\times\\cdots\\times (V^*)$ ($k$ times) to $K$. Such an mapping is\nknown as an alternating $k$-form. Using the above duality we can prove\nthat $A^k(V)$ is a model for the $k{^{\\text{th}}}$ exterior power of\n$V$.\n\nGiven alternating forms $u\\in A^k(V)$ and $v\\in A^\\ell(V)$, let us\ndefine $u\\wedge v\\in A^{k+\\ell}(V)$ according to\n$$(u\\wedge v)(a_1,\\dots,a_{k+\\ell})= \\sum_{\\pi}\\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)\nu(a_{\\pi_1},\\dots,a_{\\pi_k})\nv(a_{\\pi_{k+1}},\\dots,a_{\\pi_{k+\\ell}}),$$ where\n$a_1,\\dots,a_{k+\\ell}\\in V^*,$ and where the sum is taken over all\npermutations $\\pi$ of $\\{1,2,\\dots, k+\\ell\\}$ such that $\\pi_1<\n\\pi_2 < \\cdots < \\pi_k$ and $\\pi_{k+1} < \\cdots < \\pi_{k+\\ell}$, and\nwhere $\\operatorname{sgn} \\pi=\\pm 1$ according to whether $\\pi$ is an\neven or odd permutation. With this definition, we can show that\n$$A(V) = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^n A^k(V)$$ together with the above product, and\nthe linear isomorphism $V\\to\nA^1(V)\\cong V^{**}$ is a model for the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(V)$.\n\nHistorical Notes.\n=================\n\nThe exterior algebra is also known as the Grassmann algebra after its\ninventor who created it to give algebraic treatment of linear geometry.\nGrassmann was also one of the first people to talk about the geometry of\nan $n$-dimensional space with $n$ an arbitrary natural number. The\naxiomatics of the exterior product are needed to define differential\nforms and therefore play an essential role in the theory of integration\non manifolds. Exterior algebra is also an essential prerequisite to\nunderstanding de Rham\u2019s theory of differential cohomology.",
