  "definition": "The vector product can be defined in any finite dimensional vector space\n$V$ with $\\dim V=n$. Let $v_1,\\dots,v_n$ be a basis of $V$, we then\ndefine the vector product of the vectors $w_1,\\dots,w_{n-1}$ in the\nfollowing way:\n$$w_1\\times\\dots\\times w_{n-1}=\\sum_{j=1}^nv_j\\det(w_1,\\dots,w_{n-1},v_j).$$\nOne can easily see that some of the properties of the vector product are\nthe same as in $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n\n-   If one of the $w_i$ is equal to $0$, then the vector product is $0$.\n\n-   If $w_i$ are linearly dependent, then the vector product is $0$.\n\n-   In a Euclidean vector space $w_1\\times\\dots\\times w_{n-1}$ is\n    perpendicular to all $w_i$.",
