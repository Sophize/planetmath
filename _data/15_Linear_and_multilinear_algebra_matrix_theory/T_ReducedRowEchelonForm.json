  "definition": "For a matrix to be in *reduced row echelon form* (or *Hermite normal\nform*) it has to first satisfy the requirements to be in row echelon\nform and additionally satisfy the following requirements:\n\n1.  The first non-zero element in any row must be 1.\n\n2.  The first element of value 1 in any row must be the only non-zero\n    value in its column.\n\nAn example of a matrix in reduced row echelon form could be:\n$$\\left( \\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\n0 & 1 & 2 & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 4 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$$",
