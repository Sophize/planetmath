  "definition": "[**Definition**]{} A [**zero vector space**]{} is a vector space that\ncontains only one element, a zero vector.\n\n### Properties\n\n1.  Every vector space has a zero vector space as a vector subspace.\n\n2.  A vector space $X$ is a zero vector space if and only if the\n    dimension of $X$ is zero.\n\n3.  Any linear map defined on a zero vector space is the zero map. If\n    $T$ is linear on $\\{0\\}$, then $T(0)=T(0\\cdot 0) = 0T(0)=0$.",
