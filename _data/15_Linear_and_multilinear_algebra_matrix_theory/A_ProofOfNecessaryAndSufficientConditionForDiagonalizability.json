  "argumentText": "First, suppose that $T$ is diagonalizable. Then $V$ has a basis whose\nelements $\\{v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\}$ are eigenvectors of $T$ associated\nwith the eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{n}\\}$\nrespectively. For each $i=1,...,n$, as $v_{i}$ is an eigenvector, its\nannihilator polynomial is $m_{v_{i}}=X-\\lambda_{i}$. As these vectors\nform a basis of $V$, we have that the of $T$ is\n$m_{T}=\\operatorname{lcm}(X-\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, X-\\lambda_{n})$ which\nis trivially a product of linear factors.\n\nNow, suppose that $m_{T}=(X-\\lambda_{1}) \\ldots (X-\\lambda_{p})$ for\nsome $p$. Let $v \\in V$. Consider the $T$ - cyclic subspace generated by\n$v$, $Z(v,T)=\\left<v, Tv, \\ldots, T^{r}v\\right>$. Let $T_{v}$ be the\nrestriction of $T$ to $Z(v,T)$. Of course, $v$ is a cyclic vector of\n$Z(v,T_{v})$, and then $m_{v}=m_{T_{v}}=\\chi_{T}$. This is really easy\nto see: the dimension of $Z(v,T)$ is $r+1$, and it\u2019s also the degree of\n$m_{v}$. But as $m_{v}$ divides $m_{T_{v}}$ (because $m_{T_{v}}v=0$),\nand $m_{T}$ divides $\\chi_{T_{v}}$ (Cayley-Hamilton theorem), we have\nthat $m_{v}$ divides $\\chi_{T_{v}}$. As these are two monic polynomials\nof degree $r+1$ and one divides the other, they are equal. And then by\nthe same reasoning $m_{v}=m_{T_{v}}=\\chi_{T}$. But as $m_{v}$ divides\n$m_{T}$, then as $m_{v}=m_{T_{v}}$, we have that $m_{T_{v}}$ divides\n$m_{T}$, and then $m_{T_{v}}$ has no multiple roots and they all lie in\n$k$. But then so does $\\chi_{T_{v}}$. Suppose that these roots are\n$\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{r+1}$. Then\n$Z(v,T)=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda_{i}}E_{\\lambda_{i}}$, where $E_{\\lambda_{i}}$\nis the eigenspace associated to $\\lambda_{i}$. Then $v$ is a sum of\neigenvectors. QED.",
