  "definition": "[**Definition.**]{} The classical conception of the tensor product\noperation involved finite dimensional vector spaces $A$, $B$, say over a\nfield ${\\mathbb{K}}$. To describe the tensor product $A\\otimes B$ one\nwas obliged to chose bases\n$${\\mathbf{a}}_i\\in A,\\; i\\in I,\\quad {\\mathbf{b}}_j\\in B,\\; j\\in J$$ of\n$A$ and $B$ indexed by finite sets $I$ and $J$, respectively, and\nrepresent elements of ${\\mathbf{a}}\\in A$ and ${\\mathbf{b}}\\in B$ by\ntheir coordinates relative to these bases, i.e. as mappings\n$a:I\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}$ and $b:J\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}$ such\nthat\n$${\\mathbf{a}}= \\sum_{i\\in I} a^i {\\mathbf{a}}_i,\\qquad {\\mathbf{b}}=\\sum_{j\\in J} b^j {\\mathbf{b}}_j.$$\nOne then represented $A\\otimes B$ relative to this particular choice of\nbases as the vector space of mappings $c:I\\times J\\rightarrow\n{\\mathbb{K}}$. These mappings were called \u201csecond-order contravariant\ntensors\u201d and their values were customarily denoted by superscripts,\na.k.a. contravariant indices:\n$$c^{ij}\\in {\\mathbb{K}},\\quad i\\in I,\\; j\\in J.$$ The canonical\nbilinear multiplication (also known as outer multiplication)\n$$\\otimes:A\\times B\\rightarrow A\\otimes B$$ was defined by representing\n${\\mathbf{a}}\\otimes {\\mathbf{b}}$, relative to the chosen bases, as the\ntensor $$c^{ij} = a^ib^j,\\quad i\\in I,\\;j\\in J.$$ In this system, the\nproducts $${\\mathbf{a}}_i\\otimes {\\mathbf{b}}_j,\\quad i\\in I,\\; j\\in J$$\nwere represented by basic tensors, specified in terms of the Kronecker\ndeltas as the mappings\n$$(i',j')\\mapsto \\delta^{i'}_i \\delta^{j'}_j,\\quad i'\\in I,\\; j'\\in J.$$\nThese gave a basis of $A\\otimes B$.\n\nThe construction is independent of the choice of bases in the following\nsense. Let\n$${\\mathbf{a}'}_i\\in A,\\; i\\in {I'},\\qquad {\\mathbf{b}'}_j\\in B,\\; j\\in {J'}$$\nbe different bases of $A$ and $B$ with indexing sets ${I'}$ and ${J'}$\nrespectively. Let $$r:I\\times {I'}\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}},\\qquad\ns:J\\times {J'}\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}},$$ be the corresponding change of\nbasis matrices determined by $$\\begin{aligned}\n{\\mathbf{a}'}_{{{i'}}} &= \\sum_{i\\in I} {\\left(}r^i_{i'}{\\right)}{\\mathbf{a}}_i,\\quad {{i'}}\\in I'\\\\\n{\\mathbf{b}'}_{{{j'}}} &= \\sum_{j\\in I} {\\left(}s^j_{j'}{\\right)}{\\mathbf{b}}_j,\\quad {{j'}}\\in J'.\\end{aligned}$$\nOne then stipulated that tensors $c:I\\times J\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}$\nand ${c'}:{I'}\\times {J'}\\rightarrow {\\mathbb{K}}$ represent the same\nelement of $A\\otimes B$ if $$\\label{eq:eq1}\nc^{ij} = \\sum_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{i'\\in I'}{j'\\in J'}}\n{\\left(}r^i_{i'}{\\right)}{\\left(}s^j_{j'}{\\right)}(c')^{i'j'}$$ for all\n$i\\in I, j\\in J$. This relation corresponds to the fact that the\nproducts\n$${\\mathbf{a}'}_i\\otimes {\\mathbf{b}'}_j,\\quad i\\in I',\\; j\\in J'$$\nconstitute an alternate basis of $A\\otimes B$, and that the change of\nbasis relations are $$\\label{eq:eq2}\n  {\\mathbf{a}'}_{{i'}}\\otimes {\\mathbf{b}'}_{{j'}}= \\sum_{\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{i\\in I}{j\\in J}}\n  {\\left(}r^i_{i'}{\\right)}{\\left(}s^j_{j'}{\\right)}{\\mathbf{a}}_i\\otimes {\\mathbf{b}}_j,\\quad\n  {{i'}}\\in I',\\; {{j'}}\\in J'.$$\n\n[**Notes.**]{} Historically, the tensor product was called the [\n*outer*]{} product, and has its origins in the absolute differential\ncalculus (the theory of manifolds). The old-time tensor calculus is\ndifficult to understand because it is afflicted with a particularly\nlethal notation that makes coherent comprehension all but impossible.\nInstead of talking about an element ${\\mathbf{a}}$ of a vector space,\none was obliged to contemplate a symbol ${\\mathbf{a}}^i$, which\nsignified a list of real numbers indexed by $1,2,\\ldots,n$, and which\nwas understood to represent ${\\mathbf{a}}$ relative to some specified,\nbut unnamed basis.\n\nWhat makes this notation truly lethal is the fact a symbol\n${\\mathbf{a}}^j$ was taken to signify an alternate list of real numbers,\nalso indexed by $1,\\ldots, n$, and also representing ${\\mathbf{a}}$,\nalbeit relative to a different, but equally unspecified basis. Note that\nthe choice of [*dummy variables make all the difference.*]{} Any sane\nsystem of notation would regard the expression\n$${\\mathbf{a}}^i,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n$$ as representing a list of $n$\nsymbols $${\\mathbf{a}}^1,{\\mathbf{a}}^2,\\ldots,{\\mathbf{a}}^n.$$\nHowever, in the classical system, one was strictly forbidden from using\n$${\\mathbf{a}}^1,{\\mathbf{a}}^2,\\ldots,{\\mathbf{a}}^n$$ because where,\nafter all, is the all important dummy variable to indicate choice of\nbasis?\n\nThankfully, it is possible to shed some light onto this confusion (I\nhave read that this is credited to Roger Penrose) by interpreting the\nsymbol ${\\mathbf{a}}^i$ as a mapping from some finite index set $I$ to\n${\\mathbb{R}}$, whereas ${\\mathbf{a}}^j$ is interpreted as a mapping\nfrom another finite index set $J$ (of equal cardinality) to\n${\\mathbb{R}}$.\n\nMy own surmise is that the source of this notational difficulty stems\nfrom the reluctance of the ancients to deal with geometric objects\ndirectly. The prevalent superstition of the age held that in order to\nhave meaning, a geometric entity had to be [*measured*]{} relative to\nsome basis. Of course, it was understood that geometrically no one basis\ncould be preferred to any other, and this leads directly to the\ndefinition of geometric entities as lists of measurements modulo the\nequivalence engendered by changing the basis.\n\nIt is also worth remarking on the contravariant nature of the\nrelationship between the actual elements of $A\\otimes B$ and the\ncorresponding representation by tensors relative to a basis \u2014 compare\nequations (1) and (2). This relationship is the source of the\nterminology \u201ccontravariant tensor\u201d and \u201ccontravariant index\u201d, and I\nsurmise that it is this very medieval pit of darkness and confusion that\nspawned the present-day notion of \u201ccontravariant functor\u201d.\n\n[**References.**]{}\n\n1.
