  "definition": "Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2. Then a quadratic form $Q$\nover a vector space $V$ (over a field $k$) is said to be , if its\nassociated bilinear form: $$B(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}(Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y))$$ is\nnon-degenerate.\n\nIf we fix a basis $\\boldsymbol{b}$ for $V$, then $Q(x)$ can be written\nas\n\n$$Q(x)=x^TAx$$\n\nfor some symmetric matrix $A$ over $k$. Then it\u2019s not hard to see that\n$Q$ is non-degenerate iff $A$ is non-singular. Because of this, a\nnon-degenerate quadratic form is also known as a *non-singular*\nquadratic form. A third name for a non-degenerate quadratic form is that\nof a *regular quadratic form*.",
