  "definition": "A scalar is a quantity that is invariant under coordinate\ntransformation, also known as a tensor of rank 0. For example, the\nnumber 1 is a scalar, so is any number or variable $n\\in\\mathbb{R}$. The\npoint $(3,4)$ is not a scalar because it is variable under rotation. As\nsuch, a scalar can be an element of a field over which a vector space is\ndefined.",
