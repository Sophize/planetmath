  "statement": "Let $U$ be a finite-dimensional, unitary space and let $M:U\\rightarrow\nU$ be an endomorphism. We say that $M$ is normal if it commutes with its\nHermitian adjoint, i.e.\n$$MM{^{\\displaystyle \\star}}= M{^{\\displaystyle \\star}}M.$$\n\n#### Spectral Theorem\n\nLet $M:U\\rightarrow U$ be a linear transformation of a unitary space.\nTFAE\n\n1.  The transformation $M$ is normal.\n\n2.  Letting\n    $$\\Lambda=\\{\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb{C}}\\mid M-\\lambda E \\mbox{ is singular}\\},$$\n    where $E$ is the identity operator, denote the spectrum (set of\n    eigenvalues) of $M$, the corresponding eigenspaces\n    $$E_\\lambda=\\ker(M-\\lambda E),\\quad \\lambda\\in\\Lambda$$ give an\n    orthogonal, direct sum decomposition of $U$, i.e.\n    $$U=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda} E_\\lambda,$$ and $E_{\\lambda_1}\n      \\perp E_{\\lambda_2}$ for distinct eigenvalues $\\lambda_1\\neq\n      \\lambda_2$.\n\n3.  We can decompose $M$ as the sum\n    $$M = \\sum_{\\lambda\\in \\Lambda} \\lambda P_\\lambda,$$ where\n    $\\Lambda\\in{\\mathbb{C}}$ is a finite subset of complex numbers\n    indexing a family of commuting orthogonal projections\n    $P_\\lambda:U\\rightarrow U$, i.e.\n    $$P_\\lambda{}{^{\\displaystyle \\star}}= P_\\lambda \\qquad\n        P_\\lambda P_\\mu =\n        \\begin{cases}\n          P_\\lambda & \\lambda = \\mu \\\\\n          0 & \\lambda\\neq \\mu,\n        \\end{cases}$$ and where WLOG\n    $$\\sum_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda} P_\\lambda = 1_U.$$\n\n4.  There exists an orthonormal basis of $U$ that diagonalizes $M$.\n\n#### Remarks.\n\n1.  Here are some important classes of normal operators, distinguished\n    by the nature of their eigenvalues.\n\n    -   Hermitian operators. Eigenvalues are real.\n\n    -   Unitary transformations. Eigenvalues lie on the unit circle,\n        i.e. the set of complex numbers of modulus 1.\n\n    -   Orthogonal projections. Eigenvalues are either 0 or 1.\n\n2.  There is a well-known version of the spectral theorem for\n    ${\\mathbb{R}}$, namely that a self-adjoint (symmetric)\n    transformation of a real inner product spaces can diagonalized and\n    that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are\n    orthogonal. An even more down-to-earth version of this theorem says\n    that a symmetric, real matrix can always be diagonalized by an\n    orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.\n\n3.  There are several versions of increasing sophistication of the\n    spectral theorem that hold in infinite-dimensional, Hilbert space\n    setting. In such a context one must distinguish between the\n    so-called discrete and continuous (no corresponding eigenspace)\n    spectrums, and replace the representing sum for the operator with\n    some kind of an integral. The definition of self-adjointness is also\n    quite tricky for unbounded operators. Finally, there are versions of\n    the spectral theorem, of importance in theoretical quantum\n    mechanics, that can be applied to continuous 1-parameter groups of\n    commuting, self-adjoint operators.",
