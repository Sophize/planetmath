  "definition": "Overview {#overview .unnumbered}\n========\n\nThe *determinant* is an algebraic operation that transforms a square\nmatrix $M$ into a scalar. This operation has many useful and important\nproperties. For example, the determinant is zero if and only the matrix\n$M$ is singular (no inverse exists). The determinant also has an\nimportant geometric interpretation as the area of a parallelogram, and\nmore generally as the volume of a higher-dimensional parallelepiped.\n\nThe notion of determinant predates matrices and linear transformations.\nOriginally, the determinant was a number associated to a system of $n$\nlinear equations in $n$ variables. This number \u201cdetermined\u201d whether the\nsystem possessed a unique solution. In this sense, two-by-two\ndeterminants were considered by Cardano at the end of the 16th century\nand ones of arbitrary size (see the definition below) by Leibniz about\n100 years later.\n\nDefinition {#definition .unnumbered}\n==========\n\nLet $M$ be an $n\\times n$ matrix with entries $M_{ij}$ that are elements\nof a given field[^1]. The determinant of $M$, or $\\det M$ for short, is\nthe scalar quantity $$\\label{eq:detdef}\n\\det M = \\left|\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nM_{11} & M_{12} &\\ldots & M_{1n} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22} & \\ldots & M_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nM_{n1} & M_{n2} & \\ldots & M_{nn}\n\\end{array}\\right| = \\sum_{\\pi\\in S_n} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi) M_{1\\pi_1}\nM_{2\\pi_2}\\cdots\nM_{n\\pi_n}.$$ The index $\\pi$ in the above sum varies over all the\npermutations of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ (i.e., the elements of the symmetric\ngroup $S_n$.) Hence, there are $n!$ terms in the defining sum of the\ndeterminant. The symbol $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)$ denotes the parity of\nthe permutation; it is $\\pm 1$ according to whether $\\pi$ is an even or\nodd permutation. Using the Einstein summation convention one can also\nexpress the above definition as\n$$\\det M = \\epsilon_{\\pi_1\\pi_2\\dots \\pi_n} M^{\\pi_1}{}_1  M^{\\pi_2}{}_2\n  \\cdots  M^{\\pi_n}{}_{n},$$ where we\u2019ve raised the first index so that\n$M^i{}_j = M_{ij}$, and where\n$$\\epsilon_{\\pi_1\\dots \\pi_n} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\pi)$$ is known as\nthe Levi-Civita permutation symbol.\n\nBy way of example, the determinant of a $2\\times2$ matrix is given by\n$$\\left| \\begin{matrix} M_{11} & M_{12} \\\\ M_{21}& M_{22}\n\\end{matrix}\\right| = M_{11} M_{22}-M_{12}M_{21},$$ There are six\npermutations of the numbers $1,2,3$, namely\n$$1\\overset{+}23,\\;2\\overset{+}31,\\;3\\overset{+}12,\\;1\\overset{-}32,\\;\n3\\overset{-}21,\\;2\\overset{-}13;$$ the overset sign indicates the\npermutation\u2019s signature. Accordingly, the $3\\times 3$ deterimant is a\nsum of the following $6$ terms: $$\\left| \\begin{matrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} & M_{13} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22} & M_{23} \\\\\nM_{31} & M_{32} & M_{33}\n\\end{matrix}\\right| =\n\\begin{array}{rr}\n\\\\\nM_{11} M_{22} M_{33} + M_{12} M_{23} M_{31} + M_{13}M_{21} M_{32} \\\\\n-M_{11}M_{23}M_{32}-M_{13}M_{22} M_{31} - M_{12}M_{21}M_{33}\n\\end{array}$$\n\nRemarks and important properties {#remarks-and-important-properties .unnumbered}\n================================\n\n1.  \\[pd:mult\\] The determinant operation converts matrix multiplication\n    into scalar multiplication; $$\\det(AB)=\\det(A) \\det(B),$$ where\n    $A, B$ are square matrices of the same size.\n\n2.  The determinant operation is multi-linear, and anti-symmetric with\n    respect to the matrix\u2019s rows and columns. See the multi-linearity\n    attachment for more details.\n\n3.  The determinant of a lower triangular, or an upper triangular matrix\n    is the product of the diagonal entries, since all the other summands\n    in (1) are zero.\n\n4.  have the same determinant. To be more precise, let $A$ and $X$ be\n    square matrices with $X$ invertible. Then,\n    $$\\det(XAX^{-1})= \\det(A).$$ In particular, if we let $X$ be the\n    matrix representing a change of basis, this shows that the\n    determinant is independent of the basis. The same is true of the\n    trace of a matrix. In fact, the whole characteristic polynomial of\n    an endomorphism is definable without using a basis or a matrix, and\n    it turns out that the determinant and trace are two of its\n    coefficients.\n\n5.  The determinant of a matrix $A$ is zero if and only if $A$ is\n    singular; that is, if there exists a non-trivial solution to the\n    homogeneous equation $$A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}.$$\n\n6.  The transpose operation does not change the determinant:\n    $$\\det A^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{T}} = \\det A.$$\n\n7.  The determinant of a diagonalizable transformation is equal to the\n    product of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicities.\n\n8.  The determinant is homogeneous of degree $n$. This means that\n    $$\\det(k M ) = k^n \\det M,\\quad k\\;\\text{is a scalar.}$$\n\n[^1]: Most scientific and geometric applications deal with matrices made\n    up of real or complex numbers. However, the determinant of a matrix\n    over any field is well defined sense and has all the properties of\n    the more conventional determinant. Indeed, many properties of the\n    determinant remain valid for matrices with entries in a commutative\n    ring.",
