  "definition": "Let $E$ be a Euclidean plane. Fix a line $\\ell$ in $E$ and a real number\n$r\\ne 0$. Take any point $p\\in E$. Drop a line $m_p$ from $p$\nperpendicular to $\\ell$. Denote $d(p,\\ell)$ the distance from $p$ to\n$\\ell$. Then there is a unique point $p'$ on $m_p$ such that\n$$d(p',\\ell)=r\\cdot d(p,\\ell).$$ The function $s_r:E\\to E$ such that\n$s_r(p)=p'$ is called a *strain transformation*, or simply a *strain*.\n\nOne can visualize a strain stretches a geometric figure if $|r|>1$ and\ncompresses it if $|r|<1$. If $r=1$, then $s_r$ is the identity function,\nthe only time when a strain is a rigid motion. For example, let $\\ell$\nbe the $x$-axis and $C$ be a circle in the upper half plane of the\n$x$-$y$ plane. Then the following diagrams show how a strain transforms\n$C$:\n\n(-4,-2)(5,3) (-4,0)(4,0) (4.5,0)[$\\ell$]{} (-3,1)(0.5,0.5) (-1,2)(0.5,1)\n(1,0.5)(0.5,0.25) (3,-1)(0.5,0.5) (-3,-2)[$C$]{} (-1,-2)[$s_2(C)$]{}\n(1,-2)[$s_{\\frac{1}{2}}(C)$]{} (3,-2)[$s_{-1}(C)$]{}\n\nAgain, if $\\ell$ is the $x$-axis, then $s_r$ is the function that sends\n$(x,y)$ to $(x,ry)$. Representing the ordered pairs as column vectors\nand $s_r$ as a matrix , we have\n\n$s_r\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\ y \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & r\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\ y \n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\ ry \n\\end{pmatrix}\n.$\n\nNevertheless, a strain, as a (non-singular) linear transformation, takes\nlines to lines, and parallel lines to parallel lines.\n\nIn general, given any finite dimensional vector space $V$ over a field\n$k$, a strain $s_r$ is a non-singular diagonalizable linear\ntransformation on $V$ such that $s_r$ leaves a subspace $W$ of\ncodimension $1$ fixed. $0\\ne r\\in k$ is called the *strain coefficient*.\n\n**Remark**. By choosing an appropriate base for $V$ of dimension $n$,\n$s_r$ can be represented as a diagonal matrix whose diagonals are $1$ in\nat least $n-1$ cells and $r$ in at most one cell.\n\nIt is easy to see that every non-singular diagonalizable linear\ntransformation on $V$ can be written as a product of $n$ strains, where\n$n=\\operatorname{dim}(V)$.",
