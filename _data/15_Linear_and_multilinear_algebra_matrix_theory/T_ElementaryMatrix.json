  "definition": "### Elementary Operations on Matrices {#elementary-operations-on-matrices .unnumbered}\n\nLet $\\mathbb{M}$ be the set of all $m\\times n$ matrices (over some\ncommutative ring $R$). An operation on $\\mathbb{M}$ is called an\n*elementary row operation* if it takes a matrix $M\\in \\mathbb{M}$, and\ndoes one of the following:\n\n1.  interchanges of two rows of $M$,\n\n2.  multiply a row of $M$ by a non-zero element of $R$,\n\n3.  add a (constant) multiple of a row of $M$ to another row of $M$.\n\nAn *elementary column operation* is defined similarly. An operation on\n$\\mathbb{M}$ is an *elementary operation* if it is either an elementary\nrow operation or elementary column operation.\n\nFor example, if\n$M=\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\\\ e & f \\end{pmatrix}$, then the\nfollowing operations correspond respectively to the three types of\nelementary row operations described above\n\n1.  $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ e & f \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is obtained\n    by interchanging rows 2 and 3 of $M$,\n\n2.  $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ rc & rd \\\\ e & f \\end{pmatrix}$ is\n    obtained by multiplying $r\\ne 0$ to the second row of $M$,\n\n3.  $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\\\ sa+e & sb+f \\end{pmatrix}$ is\n    obtained by adding to row 1 multiplied by $s$ to row 3 of $M$.\n\nSome immediate observation: elementary operations of type 1 and 3 are\nalways invertible. The inverse of type 1 elementary operation is itself,\nas interchanging of rows twice gets you back the original matrix. The\ninverse of type 3 elementary operation is to add the negative of the\nmultiple of the first row to the second row, thus returning the second\nrow back to its original form. Type 2 is invertible provided that the\nmultiplier has an inverse.\n\nSome notation: for each type $k$ (where $k=1,2,3$) of elementary\noperations, let $E_c^k(A)$ be the set of all matrices obtained from $A$\nvia an elementary column operation of type $k$, and $E_r^k(A)$ the set\nof all matrices obtained from $A$ via an elementary row operation of\ntype $k$.\n\n### Elementary Matrices {#elementary-matrices .unnumbered}\n\nNow, assume $R$ has $1$. An $n\\times n$ *elementary matrix* is a\n(square) matrix obtained from the identity matrix $I_n$ by performing an\nelementary operation. As a result, we have three types of elementary\nmatrices, each corresponding to a type of elementary operations:\n\n1.  *transposition matrix* $T_{ij}$: an matrix obtained from $I_n$ with\n    rows $i$ and $j$ switched,\n\n2.  *basic diagonal matrix* $D_i(r)$: a diagonal matrix whose entries\n    are $1$ except in cell $(i,i)$, whose entry is a non-zero element\n    $r$ of $R$\n\n3.  *row replacement matrix* $E_{ij}(s)$: $I_n + s U_{ij}$, where\n    $s\\in R$ and $U_{ij}$ is a matrix unit with $i\\ne j$.\n\nFor example, among the $3\\times 3$ matrices, we have\n$$T_{12} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nD_3(r) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & r \\end{pmatrix},\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad\nE_{32}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFor each positive integer $n$, let $\\mathbb{E}^k(n)$ be the collection\nof all $n\\times n$ elementary matrices of type $k$, where $k=1,2,3$.\n\nBelow are some basic properties of elementary matrices:\n\n-   $T_{ij}=T_{ji}$, and $T_{ij}^2=I_n$.\n\n-   $D_i(r)D_i(r^{-1})=I_n$, provided that $r^{-1}$ exists.\n\n-   $E_{ij}(s) E_{ij}(-s) = I_n$.\n\n-   $\\det(T_{ij})=-1$, $\\det(D_i(r))=r$, and $\\det(E_{ij}(s))=1$.\n\n-   If $A$ is an $m\\times n$ matrix, then\n    $$E_c^k(A)=\\lbrace AE \\mid E \\in \\mathbb{E}^k(n) \\rbrace \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad E_r^k(A)=\\lbrace EA \\mid E \\in \\mathbb{E}^k(m) \\rbrace.$$\n\n-   Every non-singular matrix can be written as a product of elementary\n    matrices. This is the same as saying: given a non-singular matrix,\n    one can perform a finite number of elementary row (column)\n    operations on it to obtain the identity matrix.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   One can also define elementary matrix operations on matrices over\n    general rings. However, care must be taken to consider left scalar\n    multiplications and right scalar multiplications as separate\n    operations.\n\n-   The discussion above pertains to elementary linear algebra. In\n    algebraic K-theory, an elementary matrix is defined only as a row\n    replacement matrix (type 3) above.",
