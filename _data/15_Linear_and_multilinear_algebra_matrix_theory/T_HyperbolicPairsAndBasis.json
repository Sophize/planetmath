  "definition": "Given a reflexive non-degenerate sesquilinear form\n$b:V\\times V\\rightarrow k$, a *hyperbolic pair* is a pair $e,f\\in V$\nsuch that $$b(e,e)=0=b(f,f)\\textnormal{ and } b(e,f)=1.$$\n\nThe span of a hyperbolic pair is a hyperbolic line (recall that a line\nrefers to the projective dimension thus we have a 2-dimensional subspace\nbut a 1-dimensional projective space).\n\nA *hyperbolic basis* for a vector space $V$ with respect to a reflexive\nnon-degenerate sesquilinear form $b$ is a basis\n$\\{e_1,f_1,\\dots,e_m,f_m\\}$ where\n$$b(e_i,e_j)=0=b(f_i,f_j)\\textnormal{ and } b(e_i,f_j)=\\delta_{ij}.$$\n\nThus a hyperbolic basis is a basis composed of hyperbolic pairs.\nFurthermore, if $V$ has a hyperbolic basis then setting\n$H_i=\\langle e_i,f_i\\rangle$ shows\n$$V=H_1\\perp H_2\\perp\\cdots \\perp H_m$$ where $X\\perp Y=X\\oplus Y$ with\nthe added condition $b(X,Y)=0$.\n\nHyperbolic bases are the foundation of a \u201cstandard basis\u201d for a vector\nspaces $V$ equipped with a reflexive non-degenerate sesquilinear form.\n\nSymmetric pairs\n===============\n\nA symmetric hyperbolic pair is a hyperbolic pair $e,f$ for which $b$\nrestricted to $L=\\langle e,f\\rangle$ is a symmetric bilinear form. This\nrequires the additional condition that $b(e,f)=1=b(f,e)$.\n\nThis means that the form restricted the *hyperbolic line*\n$L=\\langle e,f\\rangle$ can be represented by the matrix\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}.$$ When $1/2\\in k$ we can\nconsider the associated quadratic form $$q(v)=\\frac{1}{2}b(v,v)$$ so if\n$v=x e+y f$ we arrive at the polynomial\n$$q(xe+yf)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left([x, y]\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} x\\\\ y\\end{bmatrix}\\right)=x y.$$\n\nSuppose the field is $\\mathbb{R}$. Then we can associate a graph to the\nequations $c=q(xe+yf)=xy$ for any fixed $c\\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $c=0$ then\n$x=0$ or $y=0$ so the graph is the $x$ and $y$-axis \u2013 also called the\ndegenerate hyperbola. If $c\\neq 0$ then $x\\neq 0$ and so\n$y=\\frac{c}{x}$. This is the graph of a a hyperbola, hence the title of\na hyperbolic pair.\n\nSymmetric bilinear maps are often preferred to be presented as diagonal\nmatrices so that they reflect the content of Sylvester\u2019s Law of Inertia.\nWhen $1/2\\in k$ (characteristic of $k$ is not 2) we can diagonalize any\nsymmetric hyperbolic pair as follows:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{bmatrix}.$$ That is, we can change\nthe basis to\n$$e\\mapsto u:=\\frac{1}{2}e+f,\\qquad f\\mapsto v:=-\\frac{1}{2}e+f.$$ Then\n$b(u,u)=1$, $b(v,v)=-1$, and $b(u,v)=b(v,u)=0$. Alternatively we find\nunder this basis we have the quadratic form $q(xu+yv)=x^2-y^2$ which is\nalso seen as the standard equation of a hyperbola.\n\nIf we think of a quadratic form as generalizing norms \u2013 that is length,\nthen we are observing that on a hyperbolic line length is not Euclidean,\nin fact, as the usual Euclidean length of $(x,y)$, $x^2+y^2$, gets\nlarge, the associated hyperbolic length get small: $x^2-y^2$ may get\nsmall, even 0 or negative. Thus the curvature of this space is negative\n(consider the graph of $z=x^2-y^2$ which is a saddle.)\n\nAll symmetric hyperbolic pairs are isometric so decomposing a bilinear\nform into the radical plus hyperbolic pairs plus any left over\nanisotropic complement produces a standard basis which allows for easy\ncomparison of one symmetric bilinear form to another.\n\nAlternating pairs\n=================\n\nAn alternating hyperbolic pair is a hyperbolic pair $e,f$ for which $b$\nrestricted to $L=\\langle e,f\\rangle$ is an alternating bilinear form.\nThis requires the additional condition that $b(e,f)=1=-b(f,e)$.\n\nThis means that the form restricted the hyperbolic line\n$L=\\langle e,f\\rangle$ can be represented by the matrix\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ -1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Although we do not\nassociate a quadratic form with an alternating bilinear (since\n$b(v,v)=0$ for all $v\\in V$) we can still derive the equations of a\nhyperbola. Specifically $$b(xe,yf)=xy.$$ So again setting\n$c=b(xe,yf)=xy$ we observe the various hyperbola graphs.\n\nAlternating hyperbolic pairs cannot be diagonalized as every element\n$v\\in V$ has $b(v,v)=0$.\n\nAll alternating bilinear forms decompose into hyperbolic lines and the\nradical and any two alternating hyperbolic lines are isometric and thus\nsimply indicating the number of hyperbolic pairs in an alternating\nbilinear form specifies the form uniquely. If we further insist the form\nis non-degenerate then the dimension of the vector space specifies the\nform completely.\n\nHermitian pairs\n===============\n\nA ** is a hyperbolic pair $e,f$ for which $b$ restricted to\n$L=\\langle e,f\\rangle$ is an Hermitian bilinear form. This requires the\nadditional condition that $b(e,f)=1=b(f,e)$. The associated matrix does\nnot reveal much difference from the symmetric as we still obtain\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}.$$ What is different is how\nthe matrix is used to compute the bilinear products:\n$$b(x_1e+y_1 f,x_2 e+y_2 f)=\n[x_1,y_1]\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{x_2}\\\\ \\bar{y_2}\\end{bmatrix}.$$ So if we compute\n$b(v,v)$ we find: $$b(xe+y f,x e+y f)=\n[x,y]\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{x}\\\\ \\bar{y}\\end{bmatrix}\n=x\\bar{y}+y\\bar{x}=(x\\bar{y})+\\overline{(x\\bar{y})}.$$ We see from this\nthat two hyperbolic pairs of Hermitian type need not be isometric unless\nwe further consider the automorphism of the two forms.\n\nCharacteristic 2\n================\n\nHyperbolic pairs over fields of characteristic 2 are a special breed\nbecause they are at the same time symmetric and alternating. That is,\nthe form is the matrix:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.$$ Thus the form cannot be diagonalized as it is\nalternating. Here it is generally more useful to use a quadratic form\nthen the bilinear form. Unfortunately because we cannot recover the\nquadratic form from the bilinear form on account that $b(v,v)=0$, such a\nquadratic form must be provided externally from some other method. Thus\nit is not always feasible.",
