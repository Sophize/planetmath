  "definition": "Let $V$ be a vector space (over a field $k$), and $T$ a linear operator\non $V$, and $\\lambda$ an eigenvalue of $T$. The set $E_{\\lambda}$ of all\ngeneralized eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to $\\lambda$, together\nwith the zero vector $0$, is called the *generalized eigenspace* of $T$\ncorresponding to $\\lambda$. In short, the generalized eigenspace of $T$\ncorresponding to $\\lambda$ is the set\n$$E_{\\lambda}:=\\lbrace v\\in V\\mid (T-\\lambda I)^i(v)=0\\textrm{ for some positive integer }i\\rbrace.$$\n\nHere are some properties of $E_{\\lambda}$:\n\n1.  $W_{\\lambda}\\subseteq E_{\\lambda}$, where $W_{\\lambda}$ is the\n    eigenspace of $T$ corresponding to $\\lambda$.\n\n2.  $E_{\\lambda}$ is a subspace of $V$ and $E_{\\lambda}$ is\n    $T$-invariant.\n\n3.  If $V$ is finite dimensional, then $\\dim(E_{\\lambda})$ is the\n    algebraic multiplicity of $\\lambda$.\n\n4.  $E_{\\lambda_1}\\cap E_{\\lambda_2}=0$ iff $\\lambda_1\\ne \\lambda_2$.\n    More generally, $E_A\\cap E_B=0$ iff $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets of\n    eigenvalues of $T$, and $E_A$ (or $E_B$) is defined as the sum of\n    all $E_{\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda\\in A$ (or $B$).\n\n5.  If $V$ is finite dimensional and $T$ is a linear operator on $V$\n    such that its characteristic polynomial $p_T$ splits (over $k$),\n    then $$V=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in S} E_{\\lambda},$$ where $S$ is the\n    set of all eigenvalues of $T$.\n\n6.  Assume that $T$ and $V$ have the same properties as in (5). By the\n    Jordan canonical form theorem, there exists an ordered basis $\\beta$\n    of $V$ such that $[T]_{\\beta}$ is a Jordan canonical form.\n    Furthermore, if we set $\\beta_i=\\beta \\cap E_{\\lambda_i}$, then\n    $[T|_{E_{\\lambda_i}}]_{\\beta_i}$, the matrix representation of\n    $T|_{E_{\\lambda}}$, the restriction of $T$ to $E_{\\lambda_i}$, is a\n    Jordan canonical form. In other words, $$[T]_{\\beta}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n    J_{1} & O & \\cdots & O\\\\\n    O & J_{2} & \\cdots & O\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    O & O & \\cdots & J_{n}\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$ where each $J_i=[T|_{E_{\\lambda_i}}]_{\\beta_i}$ is a\n    Jordan canonical form, and $O$ is a zero matrix.\n\n7.  Conversely, for each $E_{\\lambda_i}$, there exists an ordered basis\n    $\\beta_i$ for $E_{\\lambda_i}$ such that\n    $J_i:=[T|_{E_{\\lambda_i}}]_{\\beta_i}$ is a Jordan canonical form. As\n    a result, $\\beta:=\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\beta_i$ with linear order\n    extending each $\\beta_i$, such that $v_i<v_j$ for $v_i\\in \\beta_i$\n    and $v_j\\in \\beta_j$ for $i<j$, is an ordered basis for $V$ such\n    that $[T]_{\\beta}$ is a Jordan canonical form, being the direct sum\n    of matrices $J_i$.\n\n8.  Each $J_i$ above can be further decomposed into Jordan blocks, and\n    it turns out that the number of Jordan blocks in each $J_i$ is the\n    dimension of $W_{\\lambda_i}$, the eigenspace of $T$ corresponding to\n    $\\lambda_i$.\n\nMore to come...\n\n[3]{} Friedberg, Insell, Spence.
