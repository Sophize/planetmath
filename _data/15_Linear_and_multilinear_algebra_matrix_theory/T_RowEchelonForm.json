  "definition": "A matrix is said to be in row echelon form if each non-zero row has more\nleading zeros than the previous row. Row-echelon form is the key idea\nunderlying the Gaussian elimination algorithm and LU factorization.\n\nLet us give the precise definition. Let $(M_{ij})$ be an $n\\times m$\nmatrix. For each row $i=1,\\ldots,n$ define the pivot position $P_i$ to\nbe either the minimum value of $j=1,\\ldots, m$ for which $M_{ij}\\neq\n0$, or $\\infty$ if the row consists entirely of zeros. A matrix is in\nechelon form if for all $i>1$, either $P_i=\\infty$ or $P_{i-1}<P_i$.\n\nExamples of matrices in row echelon form include,\n\n$$\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n,\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}\n 5 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right)$$\n\nNote that if a matrix is an echelon form, then necessarily rows which\nare composed completely of zeros will be grouped at the bottom of the\nmatrix. Also note that if several rows have the same number of leading\nzeros then the matrix is not in row echelon form unless the rows in\nquestion are composed entirely of zeros.",
