  "definition": "Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional linear space over a field $K$, and\n$T:V\\rightarrow V$ a linear transformation. To [*diagonalize*]{} $T$ is\nto find a basis of $V$ that consists of eigenvectors. The transformation\nis called [*diagonalizable*]{} if such a basis exists. The choice of\nterminology reflects the fact that the matrix of a linear transformation\nrelative to a given basis is diagonal if and only if that basis consists\nof eigenvectors.\n\nNext, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $T$ to be\ndiagonalizable. For $\\lambda\\in K$ set\n$$E_\\lambda = \\{ u\\in V: Tu = \\lambda u\\}.$$ It isn\u2019t hard to show that\n$E_\\lambda$ is a subspace of $V$, and that this subspace is non-trivial\nif and only if $\\lambda$ is an [*eigenvalue*]{} of $T$. In that case,\n$E_\\lambda$ is called the eigenspace associated to $\\lambda$.\n\nA transformation is diagonalizable if and only if\n$$\\dim V = \\sum_\\lambda \\dim E_\\lambda,$$ where the sum is taken over\nall eigenvalues of the transformation.\n\n#### The Matrix Approach.\n\nAs was already mentioned, the term \u201cdiagonalize\u201d comes from a\nmatrix-based perspective. Let $M$ be a of $T$ relative to some basis\n$B$. Let $$P=[v_1,\\ldots,v_n],\\quad n=\\dim V,$$ be a matrix whose column\nvectors are eigenvectors expressed relative to $B$. Thus,\n$$M v_i = \\lambda_i v_i,\\quad i=1,\\ldots,n$$ where $\\lambda_i$ is the\neigenvalue associated to $v_i$. The above $n$ equations are more\nsuccinctly as the matrix equation $$MP = PD,$$ where $D$ is the diagonal\nmatrix with $\\lambda_i$ in the $i$-th position. Now the eigenvectors in\nquestion form a basis, if and only if $P$ is invertible. In that case,\nwe may write $$\\label{eq:diag}\n  M=PDP^{-1}.$$ Thus in the matrix-based approach, to \u201cdiagonalize\u201d a\nmatrix $M$ is to find an invertible matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$\nsuch that equation (\\[eq:diag\\]) is satisfied.\n\n#### Subtleties.\n\nThere are two fundamental reasons why a transformation $T$ can fail to\nbe diagonalizable.\n\n1.  The characteristic polynomial of $T$ does not factor into linear\n    factors over $K$.\n\n2.  There exists an eigenvalue $\\lambda$, such that the kernel of\n    $(T-\\lambda I)^2$ is strictly greater than the kernel of $(T-\\lambda\n    I)$. Equivalently, there exists an invariant subspace where $T$ acts\n    as a nilpotent transformation plus some multiple of the identity.\n    Such subspaces manifest as non-trivial Jordan blocks in the Jordan\n    canonical form of the transformation.",
