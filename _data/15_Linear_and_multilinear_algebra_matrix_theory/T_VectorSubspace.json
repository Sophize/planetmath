  "definition": "[**Definition**]{} Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$, and let\n$W$ be a subset of $V$. If $W$ is itself a vector space, then $W$ is\nsaid to be a *vector subspace* of $V$. If in addtition $V\\neq W$, then\n$W$ is a *proper vector subspace* of $V$.\n\nIf $W$ is a nonempty subset of $V$, then a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for $W$ to be a subspace is that $a+\\gamma b \\in W$ for all\n$a,b \\in W$ and all $\\gamma \\in F$.\n\n### Examples\n\n1.  Every vector space is a vector subspace of itself.\n\n2.  In every vector space, $\\{0\\}$ is a vector subspace.\n\n3.  If $S$ and $T$ are vector subspaces of a vector space $V$, then the\n    vector sum $$S+T=\\{s+t \\in V \\mid s\\in S, t\\in T\\}$$ and the\n    intersection $$S\\cap T = \\{u \\in V \\mid u\\in S, u\\in T \\}$$ are\n    vector subspaces of $V$.\n\n4.  Suppose $S$ and $T$ are vector spaces, and suppose $L$ is a linear\n    mapping $L\\colon S\\to T$. Then $\\operatorname{Im}L$ is a vector\n    subspace of $T$, and $\\operatorname{Ker}L$ is a vector subspace of\n    $S$.\n\n5.  If $V$ is an inner product space, then the orthogonal complement of\n    any subset of $V$ is a vector subspace of $V$.\n\n### Results for vector subspaces\n\n[**Theorem 1**]{} [@lang] Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space.\nIf $W$ is a vector subspace of $V$ and $\\dim W=\\dim V$, then $W=V$.\n\n[**Theorem 2**]{} [@deskins] (Dimension theorem for subspaces) Let $V$\nbe a vector space with subspaces $S$ and $T$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\dim (S+T) + \\dim (S\\cap T) &=& \\dim S + \\dim T.\n \\end{aligned}$$\n\n[9]{} S. Lang, *Linear Algebra*, Addison-Wesley, 1966. W.E.
