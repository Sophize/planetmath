  "definition": "Complexification of vector space\n--------------------------------\n\nIf $V$ is a real vector space, its [*complexification*]{}\n${V^\\mathbb{C}}$ is the complex vector space consisting of elements\n$x + iy$, where $x, y \\in V$. Vector addition and scalar multiplication\nby complex numbers are defined in the obvious way: $$\\begin{aligned}\n(x + iy) + (u+iv) &= (x+u) + i(y+v)\\,, & x, y, u, v \\in V \\\\\n(\\alpha + i\\beta) (x+iy) &= (\\alpha x - \\beta y) + i(\\beta x + \\alpha y), & x, y \\in V, \\alpha, \\beta \\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\,.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIf $v_1, \\dotsc, v_n$ is a basis for $V$, then\n$v_1 + i0, \\dotsc, v_n + i0$ is a basis for ${V^\\mathbb{C}}$. Naturally,\n$x + i0 \\in {V^\\mathbb{C}}$ is often written just as $x$.\n\nSo, for example, the complexification of ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is (isomorphic\nto) ${\\mathbb{C}}^n$.\n\nComplexification of linear transformation\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf $T\\colon V \\to W$ is a linear transformation between two real vector\nspaces $V$ and $W$, its complexification\n${T^\\mathbb{C}}\\colon {V^\\mathbb{C}}\\to {W^\\mathbb{C}}$ is defined by\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n{T^\\mathbb{C}}(x+iy) = Tx + iTy\\,.\\end{aligned}$$ It may be readily\nverified that ${T^\\mathbb{C}}$ is complex-linear.\n\nIf $v_1, \\dotsc, v_n$ is a basis for $V$, $w_1, \\dotsc, w_m$ is a basis\nfor $W$, and $A$ is the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to\nthese bases, then $A$, regarded as a complex matrix, is also the\nrepresentation of ${T^\\mathbb{C}}$ with respect to the corresponding\nbases in ${V^\\mathbb{C}}$ and ${W^\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\nSo, the complexification process is a formal, coordinate-free way of\nsaying: take the matrix $A$ of $T$, with its real entries, but operate\non it as a complex matrix. The advantage of making this abstracted\ndefinition is that we are not required to fix a choice of coordinates\nand use matrix representations when otherwise there is no need to. For\nexample, we might want to make arguments about the complex eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors for a transformation $T\\colon V \\to V$, while, of\ncourse, non-real eigenvalues and eigenvectors, by definition, cannot\nexist for a transformation between real vector spaces. What we really\nmean are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ${T^\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\nAlso, the complexification process generalizes without change for\ninfinite-dimensional spaces.\n\nComplexification of inner product\n---------------------------------\n\nFinally, if $V$ is also a real inner product space, its real inner\nproduct can be extended to a complex inner product for ${V^\\mathbb{C}}$\nby the obvious expansion:\n$$\\langle x+iy, u+iv \\rangle = \\langle x, u \\rangle + \\langle y, v \\rangle + i(\\langle y, u \\rangle - \\langle x, v \\rangle)\\,.$$\nIt follows that\n${\\lVertx+iy\\rVert}^2 = {\\lVertx\\rVert}^2 + {\\lVerty\\rVert}^2$.\n\nComplexification of norm\n------------------------\n\nMore generally, for a real normed vector space $V$, the equation\n$${\\lVertx+iy\\rVert}^2 = {\\lVertx\\rVert}^2 + {\\lVerty\\rVert}^2$$ can\nserve as a definition of the norm for ${V^\\mathbb{C}}$.\n\n[3]{} Vladimir I.
