For the\ndeterminant, we then have $\\det A = \\det A^T$, and\n$\\det (-A) = (-1)^n \\det A$. Thus, since $n$ is odd, and $A^T=-A$, we\nhave $\\det A = -\\det A$, and the theorem follows. $\\Box$\n\n### Remarks\n\n1.  According to [@eves], this theorem was given by Carl Gustav Jacob\n    Jacobi (1804-1851) [@jacobi] in 1827.\n\n2.  The $2\\times 2$ matrix $\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\n     0 & 1 \\\\\n     -1 & 0\n     \\end{array} \\right)$ shows that Jacobi\u2019s theorem does not hold for\n    $2\\times 2$ matrices. The determinant of the $2n\\times 2n$ block\n    matrix with these $2\\times 2$ matrices on the diagonal equals\n    $(-1)^n$. Thus Jacobi\u2019s theorem does not hold for matrices of even\n    order.\n\n3.  For $n=3$, any antisymmetric matrix $A$ can be written as $$A =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & -v_3 & v_2 \\\\\n    v_3 & 0 & -v_1 \\\\\n    -v_2 & v_1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}$$ for some real $v_1,v_2,v_3$, which can be written as\n    a vector $v=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$. Then $A$ is the matrix representing the\n    mapping $u\\mapsto v\\times u$, that is, the cross product with\n    respect to $v$. Since $Av=v\\times v=0$, we have $\\det A=0$.\n\n[9]{} H.
