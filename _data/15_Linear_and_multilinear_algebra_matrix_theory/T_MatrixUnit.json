  "definition": "A *matrix unit* is a matrix (over some ring with $1$) whose entries are\nall $0$ except in one cell, where it is $1$.\n\nFor example, among the $3\\times 2$ matrices, $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 \n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix}$$ are the matrix units.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be $m\\times n$ and $p\\times q$ matrices over $R$, and\n$U_{ij}$ an $n\\times p$ matrix unit (over $R$). Then\n\n1.  $AU_{ij}$ is the $m\\times p$ matrix whose $j$th column is the $i$th\n    column of $A$, and $0$ everywhere else, and\n\n2.  $U_{ij}B$ is the $n\\times q$ matrix whose $i$th row is the $j$th row\n    of $B$ and $0$ everywhere else.\n\n**Remarks**. Let $M=M_{m\\times n}(R)$ be the set of all $m$ by $n$\nmatrices with entries in a ring $R$ (with $1$). Denote $U_{ij}$ the\nmatrix unit in $M$ whose cell $(i,j)$ is $1$.\n\n-   $M$ is a (left or right) $R$-module generated by the $m\\times n$\n    matrix units.\n\n-   When $m=n$, $M$ has the structure of an algebra over $R$. The matrix\n    units have the following properties:\n\n    1.  $U_{ij}U_{k\\ell}=\\delta_{jk}U_{i\\ell}$, and\n\n    2.  $U_{11}+\\cdots+U_{nn}=I_n$,\n\n    where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta and $I_n$ is the identity\n    matrix. Note that the $U_{ii}$ form a complete set of pairwise\n    orthogonal idempotents, meaning $U_{ii}U_{ii}=U_{ii}$ and\n    $U_{ii}U_{jj}=0$ if $i\\ne j$.\n\n-   In general, in a matrix ring $S$ (consisting of, say, all\n    $n\\times n$ matrices), any set of $n$ matrices satisfying the two\n    properties above is called a *full set of matrix units* of $S$.\n\n-   For example, if $\\lbrace U_{ij}\\mid 1\\le i,j\\le 2\\rbrace$ is the set\n    of $2\\times 2$ matrix units over $\\mathbb{R}$, then for any\n    invertible matrix $T$,\n    $\\lbrace TU_{ij}T^{-1}\\mid 1\\le i,j\\le 2\\rbrace$ is a full set of\n    matrix units.\n\n-   If we embed $R$ as a subring of $M_n(R)$, then $R$ is the\n    centralizer of the matrix units of $M_n(R)$, meaning that the only\n    elements in $M_n(R)$ that commute with the matrix units are the\n    elements in $R$.\n\n[9]{} T.
