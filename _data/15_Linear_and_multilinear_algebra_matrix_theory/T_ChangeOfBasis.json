  "definition": "Let $V$ be a vector space. Given a basis $A$ for $V$, each vector\n$v\\in V$ can be uniquely expressed in terms of the base elements\n$v_i\\in A$ as follows: $$v=\\sum_{v_i\\in A} r_iv_i$$ where the sum is\ntaken over a finite number of elements in $A$. Suppose now that $B$ is\nanother basis for $V$. By a *change of basis* from $A$ to $B$ we mean\nre-expressing $v$ in terms of base elements $w_i\\in B$.\n\nFormally, we can think of a change of basis as the identity function\n(viewed as a linear operator) on a vector space $V$, such that elements\nin the domain are expressed in terms of $A$ and elements in the range\nare expressed in terms of $B$.\n\nNote that, by the very design of a basis, a change of basis in a vector\nspace is always possible.\n\nNow, if $V$ has dimension $n<\\infty$. We can total order bases $A$ and\n$B$. Then a change of basis (from $A$ to $B$) has the matrix\nrepresentation $$[I]^A_B,$$ where $I:V\\to V$ is the identity operator.\n$[I]^A_B$ is called a *change of basis matrix*. By applying $[I]^A_B$ to\na vector $v$ expressed in terms of $A$, we get $v$ expressed in terms of\n$B$: $$[v]_B=[I]^A_B[v]_A,$$ where $[v]_A$ and $[v]_B$ are $v$ expressed\nin the two bases $A$ and $B$ respectively.\n\nSince $I$ is obviously invertible, $[I]^A_B$ is invertible also, whose\ninverse is $[I]^B_A$. Furthermore, $[I]_A=I_n$ for any basis $A$. Here,\n$I_n$ is the identity matrix.\n\n**Examples**.\n\n1.  Let $V=\\mathbb{R}^3$ and the following two sets\n    $$A=\\Bigg\\lbrace \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\-1\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\3\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} \\Bigg\\rbrace \\mbox{ and }B=\\Bigg\\lbrace \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\0\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix} \\Bigg\\rbrace$$\n    be the two ordered bases for $V$, ordered in the way the elements\n    are arranged in the set. For each $v_i\\in A$,\n    $I(v_i)=v_i=[v_i]_{E_3}$, we see that\n    $$[I]^A_B=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&2 \\\\ -1&1&3 \\\\ 2&1&0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n    Notice that the columns of $[I]^A_B$ are exactly the elements of\n    $A$. Indeed, each element of $A$ is *already* written in terms of\n    the standard basis elements (in $B$). For example, let $v$ be the\n    first basis element in $A$. Let us see what $[v]_A$ is, when\n    expressed using base elements in $B$, the standard ordered basis:\n    $$[v]_B=[I]^A_B[v]_A=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&2 \\\\ -1&1&3 \\\\ 2&1&0 \\end{pmatrix}[v]_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&2 \\\\ -1&1&3 \\\\ 2&1&0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\-1\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix},$$\n    exactly as we have expected.\n\n2.  Conversely, let $w$ be the first basis element in $B$. What is $w$\n    when expressed in terms of basis elements of $A$? In other words, we\n    need to find $$[w]_A=[I]^B_A[w]_B.$$ Now, $[w]_B$ is just\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $[w]_A$ is nothing more\n    than the first column of $[I]^B_A$, which is just the inverse of the\n    matrix $[I]^A_B$, so\n    $$[I]^B_A={([I]^A_B)}^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&2 \\\\ -1&1&3 \\\\ 2&1&0 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1/3&-2/9&2/9 \\\\ -2/3&4/9&5/9 \\\\ 1/3&1/9&-1/9 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n    Therefore, $[w]_A=\\begin{pmatrix}1/3\\\\-2/3\\\\1/3 \\end{pmatrix}$. A\n    quick verification shows that this is indeed the case:\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}= (1/3) \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix} + (-2/3)\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} + (1/3)\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\3\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\n3.  Now let $C$ be the set\n    $\\Bigg\\lbrace \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1\\\\1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\1\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix} \\Bigg\\rbrace$.\n    It is easy to check that $C$ forms a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^3$\n    (determinant is non-zero). Order $C$ in the obvious manner. What is\n    the change of basis matrix $[I]^C_A$? One way is to express each\n    element of $C$ in terms of the elements of $A$. Another way is to\n    use the formula $[I]^C_A=[I]^B_A[I]^C_B$. Applying the first\n    example, we see that $[I]^C_B$ is just the matrix whose columns are\n    elements of $C$. As a result:\n    $$[I]^C_A=[I]^B_A[I]^C_B=\\begin{pmatrix} 1/3&-2/9&2/9 \\\\ -2/3&4/9&5/9 \\\\ 1/3&1/9&-1/9 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1&0&2 \\\\ 0&1&1 \\\\ 2&1&0 \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} 7/9&0&4/9 \\\\ 4/9&1&-8/9 \\\\ 1/9&0&7/9 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\n**Remarks.** Let us summarize what we have learned from the examples\nabove, as well as list some additional facts. Let $V$ be a finite\ndimensional vector space of dimension $n$.\n\n-   If $E$ is the standard basis (ordered), then for any ordered basis\n    $A$, $[I]^A_E$ is the matrix whose columns are exactly the basis\n    elements in $A$ (assuming these elements have already been expressed\n    in terms of $E$) such that the $i$-column corresponds to the $i$-th\n    element in the ordered set $A$.\n\n-   This also means that every invertible matrix $A$ corresponds to (in\n    a one-to-one fashion) a change of basis from the basis $S_A$ whose\n    elements are columns of $A$ to $E$, the standard basis:\n    $A=[I]^{S_A}_E$.\n\n-   Continue to assume that $E$ is the standard basis. Let $A,B$ be any\n    ordered bases for $V$. Using the above property, we can easily\n    compute $[I]^A_B$, which is $[I]^E_B[I]^A_E=([I]^B_E)^{-1}[I]^A_E.$\n\n-   Let $A'$ be a re-ordering of the ordered basis $A$, where each\n    $v'_i\\in A'$ is just $v_{\\pi(i)}$ for some permutation in $S_n$.\n    Then $[I]^{A'}_A$ is the permutation matrix corresponding to the\n    permutation $\\pi$.\n\n-   Suppose $T$ is a linear transformation from $V$ to $W$ (both finite\n    dimensional). Under a bases $A\\subset V$ and $B\\subset W$, $T$ has\n    matrix representation $[T]^A_B$. Under changes of basis from $A$ to\n    $A'$, and $B$ to $B'$, we have\n    $$[T]^{A'}_{B'}=[ITI]^{A'}_{B'}=[I]^B_{B'}[T]^A_B[I]^{A'}_A.$$\n\n-   If $T$ is a linear operator on $V$, then setting $V=W$, $A=B$ and\n    $A'=B'$ from above, we have that $$[T]_{A'}=P^{-1}[T]_A P,$$ where\n    $P$ is the change of basis matrix $[I]^{A'}_A$. This shows that\n    $[T]_A$ and $[T]_{A'}$ are similar matrices. In other words, under a\n    change of basis, the linear transformation $T$ is basically the\n    same.\n\n[3]{} Friedberg, Insell, Spence. [*Linear Algebra*]{}. Prentice-Hall\nInc., 1997.",
