  "argumentText": "We first prove the case $r=2$. The $\\subseteq$ inclusion is clear, since\nthe right side is a $T$-invariant subspace that contains $v_1+v_2$.\n\nFor the other inclusion, it is sufficient to show that\n$v_1,v_2 \\in Z(v_1+v_2,T)$. The idea is that the action of $T$ on\n$v_1 + v_2$ can \u201cisolate\u201d the two summands if their annihilator\npolynomials are coprime. Let\u2019s write $m_i$ for $m_{v_i}$.\n\nSince $(m_1,m_2)=1$, there exist polynomials $p$ and $q$ such that\n$$pm_1+qm_2=1$$ this is B\u00c3\u00a9zout\u2019s lemma (or the Euclidean algorithm, or\nthe fact that $k[X]$ is a principal ideal domain).\n\nNow $pm_1(T)$ is the projection from $Z(v_1,T) \\oplus Z(v_2,T)$ to\n$Z(v_2,T)$: $$(pm_1)(T)v_1=p(T)m_1(T) v_1 = p(T)0 = 0$$ (by assumption\nthat $m_1$ is the annihilator polynomial of $v_1$) and\n$$(pm_1)(T) = 1-(qm_2)(T)$$ (by choice of $p$ and $q$), so\n$$(pm_1)(T) v_2 = v_2 - q(T)m_2(T) v_2 = v_2 - q(T)0 = v_2$$\n\nAny subspace that is invariant under $T$ is also invariant under\npolynomials of $T$. Therefore, the preceding equations show that\n$v_2 = (pm_1)(T)(v_1+v_2) \\in Z(v_1+v_2,T)$. By symmetry, we also get\nthat $v_1 \\in Z(v_1+v_2,T)$.\n\nFor the last claim, we note that the annihilator polynomial $m$ of\n$Z(v_1,T) \\oplus Z(v_2,T)$ is the least common multiple of $m_1$ and\n$m_2$ (that $m$ is a multiple of $m_1$ follows from the fact that $m$\nmust annihilate $v_1$, and the set of polynomials that annihilate $v_1$\nis the ideal generated by $m_1$). Since $m_1$ and $m_2$ are coprime, the\nlcm is just their product.\n\nThat concludes the proof for $r=2$. If $r$ is arbitrary, we can simply\napply the $r=2$ case inductively. We only have to check that the\ncoprimality condition is preserved under applying the $r=2$ case to\n$i=1,2$. But it is well-known that if $p,q,r$ (in $k[X]$ or in any\nprincipal ideal domain) are pairwise coprime, then $pq$ and $r$ are also\ncoprime.",
