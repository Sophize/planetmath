  "definition": "A nonnegative square matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ is said to be a if there exists\n$k$ such that $A^k\\gg 0$, i.e., if there exists $k$ such that for all\n$i,j$, the $(i,j)$ entry of $A^k$ is positive.\n\nA sufficient condition for a matrix to be a primitive matrix is for the\nmatrix to be a nonnegative, irreducible matrix with a positive element\non the main diagonal.",
