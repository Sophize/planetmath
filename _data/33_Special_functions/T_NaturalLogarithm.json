  "definition": "The natural logarithm of a number is the logarithm in base of Euler\u2019s\nnumber $e$. It can be defined as the map\n$\\ln\\colon\\mathbb{R}_+\\to\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $$\\label{eq:definition}\n\\ln(x)\\colon =\\int_1^x\\frac{1}{t}dt.$$ Figure \\[fig:graph\\] shows the\ngraph of $\\ln$.\n\n![The graph of $\\ln(x)$.[]{data-label=\"fig:graph\"}](logarithm.ps)\n\nInstead of $\\ln$ many mathematicians write $\\log$, physicists (and\ncalculators) however consider $\\log$ as the symbol for the logarithm in\nbase 10. One can show that the function defined in this way is the\ninverse of the exponential function. Indeed with equation\n(\\[eq:definition\\]) we have\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(e^x)=e^x\\cdot\\frac{1}{e^x}=1,$$ so there exists\n$C\\in\\mathbb{R}$ such that $$\\ln(e^x)=x+C.$$ Since $\\ln(e^0)=0$ we have\n$C=0$. One can also prove that the above integral has the defining\nproperties of a logarithm. For example if $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$ we have\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\ln(xy)&=&\\int_1^x\\frac{1}{t}\\mathit{dt}+\\int_x^{xy}\\frac{1}{t}\\mathit{dt}\\\\\n&=&\\ln(x)+\\int_x^{xy}\\frac{1}{t}dt.\\end{aligned}$$ Now applying the\nsubstitution law with $u\\colon =\\frac{t}{x}$ we have\n$$\\int_x^{xy}\\frac{1}{t}\\mathit{dt}=\\int_1^y\\frac{1}{u}\\mathit{du}=\\ln(y),$$\nso we have $$\\ln(xy)=\\ln(x)+\\ln(y).$$ The natural logarithm can also be\nrepresented as a power series around $1$. For $-1<x\\le 1$ we have\n$$\\label{eq:power}\n\\ln(1+x)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}x^k.$$ This series is\ndivergent at $x=-1$ but for $x=1$ we have convergence due to Leibniz\u2019s\ntheorem and obtain $$\\ln(2)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}.$$ In\nreal analysis there is no reasonable way to extend the logarithm to\nnegative numbers. In complex analysis the situation is a bit more\ncomplicated. Basically one can use the Euler relation to write a\nnon-zero complex number $z$ in the form $z=Re^{i\\varphi}$ with\n$R,\\varphi\\in\\mathbb{R}$. We could try to define the complex logarithm\n$\\ln(z)$ to be $\\ln(R)+i\\varphi$. However $\\varphi$ is unique only up to\naddition of a multiple of $2\\pi$. While at first glance this does not\nappear to be very problematic, it actually prevents one from setting up\na continuous logarithm on the complex plane (without 0, where the\nlogarithm should be infinite). Say for example that we let the imaginary\npart of our logarithm take values from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$. Then\n$$\\lim_{\\varphi\\searrow-\\pi}\\ln e^{i\\varphi}=-i\\pi$$ and\n$$\\lim_{\\varphi\\nearrow\\pi}\\ln e^{i\\varphi}=i\\pi$$ while\n$e^{i\\varphi}\\to-1$ for both limits. Therefore the logarithm we defined\nis not continuous at -1. The same argument allows one to show that it is\nnot continuous on the negative real numbers. In fact you can only define\na continuous complex logarithm on a sliced plane, i.e. the complex plane\nwith a half-line starting at 0 removed.",
