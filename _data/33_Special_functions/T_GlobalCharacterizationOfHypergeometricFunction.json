  "definition": "Riemann noted that the hypergeometric function can be characterized by\nits global properties, without reference to power series, differential\nequations, or any other sort of explicit expression. His\ncharacterization is conveniently restated in terms of sheaves:\n\nSuppose that we have a sheaf of holomorphic functions over $\\mathbb{C} \n\\setminus \\{0,1\\}$ which satisfy the following properties:\n\n-   It is closed under analytic continuation.\n\n-   It is closed under taking linear combinations.\n\n-   The space of function elements over any open set is two dimensional.\n\n-   There exists a neighborhood $D_0$ such that $0 \\in D)$, holomorphic\n    functions $\\phi_0, \\psi_0$ defined on $D_0$, and complex numbers\n    $\\alpha_0,\n    \\beta_0$ such that, for an open set of $d_0$ not containing $0$, it\n    happens that $z \\mapsto z^{\\alpha_0} \\phi(z)$ and\n    $z \\mapsto z^{\\beta_0} \\psi(z)$ belong to our sheaf.\n\nThen the sheaf consists of solutions to a hypergeometric equation, hence\nthe function elements are hypergeometric functions.",
