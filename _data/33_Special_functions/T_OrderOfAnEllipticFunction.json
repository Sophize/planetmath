  "definition": "The *order* of an elliptic function is the number of poles of the\nfunction contained within a fundamental period parallelogram, counted\nwith multiplicity. Sometimes the term \u201cdegree\u201d is also used \u2014 this usage\nagrees with the theory of Riemann surfaces.\n\nThis order is always a finite number; this follows from the fact that a\nmeromorphic function can only have a finite number of poles in a compact\nregion (such as the closure of a period parallelogram). As it turns out,\nthe order can be any integer greater than 1.",
