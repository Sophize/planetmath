  "definition": "The *Legendre polynomials* are a set of polynomials\n$\\{P_n\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ each of order $n$ that satisfy Legendre\u2019s ODE:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}[(1-x^2) P_n'(x)] + n(n+1)P_n(x) = 0.$$\n\nAlternatively $P_n$ is an eigenfunction of the self-adjoint differential\noperator $\\frac{d}{dx}(1-x^2) \\frac{d}{dx}$ with eigenvalue $-n(n+1)$.\n\nThe Legendre polynomials are also known as Legendre functions of the\nfirst kind.\n\nBy Sturm-Liouville theory, this means they\u2019re orthogonal over some\ninterval with some weight function. In fact it can be shown that they\u2019re\northogonal on $[-1, 1]$ with weight function $W(x) = 1$. As with any set\nof orthogonal polynomials, this can be used to generate them (up to\nnormalization) by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the monomials\n$\\{x^i\\}$. The normalization used is\n$\\langle P_n \\| P_n \\rangle = 2 / (2n + 1)$, which makes\n$P_n(\\pm 1) = (\\pm 1)^n$\n\nRodrigues\u2019s Formula (which can be generalized to some other polynomial\nsets) is a sometimes convenient form of $P_n$ in terms of derivatives:\n$$P_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2^n n!} \\left( \\frac{d}{dx} \\right)^n (x^2 - 1)^n$$\n\nThe first few explicitly are:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nP_0(x) &=& 1 \\\\\nP_1(x) &=& x \\\\\nP_2(x) &=& \\frac{1}{2} (3x^2 - 1) \\\\\nP_3(x) &=& \\frac{1}{2} (5x^3 - 3x) \\\\\nP_4(x) &=& \\frac{1}{8} (35x^4 - 30x^2 + 3) \\\\\n...\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAs all orthogonal polynomials do, these satisfy a three-term recurrence\nrelation: $$(n+1)P_{n+1}(x) = (2n+1)xP_{n}(x) - (n)P_{n-1}(x)$$\n\nThe Legendre functions of the second kind also satisfy the Legendre ODE\nbut are not regular at the origin.\n\nRelated are the associated Legendre functions, and spherical harmonics.",
