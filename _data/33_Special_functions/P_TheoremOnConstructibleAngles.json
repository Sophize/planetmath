  "statement": "Let $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  An angle of $\\theta$ is ;\n\n2.  $\\sin \\theta$ is a constructible number;\n\n3.  $\\cos \\theta$ is a constructible number.\n\nFirst of all, due to periodicity, we can restrict our attention to the\ninterval $0 \\le \\theta <2\\pi$. Even better, we can further restrict our\nattention to the interval $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n1.  If an angle whose measure is $\\theta$ is constructible, then so are\n    angles whose measures are $\\pi-\\theta$, $\\pi+\\theta$, and\n    $2\\pi-\\theta$;\n\n2.  If $x$ is a constructible number, then so is $|x|$.\n\nIf $\\theta \\in \\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\}$, then clearly an angle of measure\n$\\theta$ is constructible, and $\\{\\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta \\}=\\{0,1\\}$.\nThus, has been established in the case that\n$\\theta \\in \\{0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\}$. Therefore, we can restrict our\nattention even further to the interval $0<\\theta<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAssume that an angle of measure $\\theta$ is constructible. Construct\nsuch an angle and mark off a line segment of length $1$ from the of the\nangle. Label the endpoint that is not the vertex of the angle as $A$.\n\n(-1,-1)(2,3) (-0.1,0)[.]{} (2,0)[.]{} (2,3.464)[.]{} (0,0)(2,0)\n(0,0)(2,3.464) (0,0)[0.3]{}[0]{}[60]{} (0.5,0.3)[$\\theta$]{}\n(0,0)[3]{}[50]{}[70]{} (0,0)(1.5,2.598) (1.2,2.3)[$A$]{}\n\nDrop the perpendicular from $A$ to the other ray of the angle.
