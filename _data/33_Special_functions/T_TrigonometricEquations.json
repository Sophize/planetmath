  "definition": "A [*trigonometric equation*]{} values of given trigonometric functions\nwhose arguments are unknown angles. The task is to determine all\npossible values of those angles. For obtaining the solution one needs\nthe following properties of the trigonometric functions:\n\n-   Two angles have the same value of sine iff the angles are equal or\n    supplementary angles or differ of each other by a multiple of full\n    angle.\n\n-   Two angles have the same value of cosine iff the angles are equal or\n    angles or differ of each other by a multiple of full angle.\n\n-   Two angles have the same value of tangent iff the angles are equal\n    or differ of each other by a multiple of straight angle.\n\n-   Two angles have the same value of cotangent iff the angles are equal\n    or differ of each other by a multiple of straight angle.\\\n\nThe first principle in solving a trigonometric equation is that try to\nelaborate with goniometric formulae or else it so that only one\ntrigonometric function on one angle remains in the equation. Then the\nequation is usually resolved to the form $$\\begin{aligned}\nf(kx) = a,\\end{aligned}$$ where $k$ and $a$ are known numbers and $f$ is\none of the functions sin, cos, tan, cot. Thereafter one can solve the\nvalues of the angle $kx$ and, dividing these by $k$, at last the values\nof the angle $x$.\n\n**Example 1.** $$\\sin{x}\\cos{x}+\\frac{1}{4} = 0$$\n$$2\\sin{x}\\cos{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$ $$\\sin{2x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\sin{2x} = \\sin{210^\\circ}$$\n$$2x = 210^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad 2x = 180^\\circ-210^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\n$$x = 105^\\circ+n\\cdot180^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad x = -15^\\circ+n\\cdot180^\\circ$$\nOn the third line one used the double angle formula of sine.\\\nIt may happen that the form (1) cannot be attained, but instead e.g. the\nform $$\\begin{aligned}\nf(kx) = f(\\alpha),\\end{aligned}$$ where $x$ can be in $\\alpha$.\n\n**Example 2.** $$\\sin2x = \\cos3x$$ $$\\cos(90^\\circ-2x) = \\cos3x$$\n$$90^\\circ-2x = 3x+n\\cdot360^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad 90^\\circ-2x = -3x+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\n$$-2x-3x = -90^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad -2x+3x = -90^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\n$$x = 18^\\circ+n\\cdot72^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad x = -90^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\nOn the second line one of the complement formulas was utilized.\\\n**Example 3.** $$\\sin{2x} = -\\sin{3x}$$ $$\\sin{2x} = \\sin(-3x)$$\n$$2x = -3x+n\\cdot360^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad 2x = 180^\\circ-(-3x)+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\n$$x = n\\cdot72^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad x = 180^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$ On\nthe second line the of sine was utilized.\\\n**Example 4.** $$\\cos{2x} = -\\cos{3x}$$\n$$\\cos{2x} = \\cos(180^\\circ-3x)$$\n$$2x = \\pm(180^\\circ-3x)+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\n$$x = 36^\\circ+n\\cdot72^\\circ \\quad \\lor \\quad x = 180^\\circ+n\\cdot360^\\circ$$\nOn the second line the of sine was utilized.",
