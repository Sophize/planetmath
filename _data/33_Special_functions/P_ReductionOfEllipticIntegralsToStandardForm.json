  "statement": "Any integral of the form $\\int R(x,\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\, dx$, where $R$ is a\nrational function and $P$ is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4 can be\nexpressed as a linear combination of elementary functions and elliptic\nintegrals of the first, second, and third kinds.\n\nTo begin, we will assume that $P$ has no repeated roots. Were this not\nthe case, we could simply pull the repeated factor out of the radical\nand be left with a polynomial of degree of 1 or 2 inside the square root\nand express the integral in terms of inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nMake a change of variables $z = (a x + b) / (c x + d)$. By choosing the\ncoefficients $a, b, c, d$ suitably, one can cast P into either Jacobi\u2019s\nnormal form $P(z) = (1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)$ or Weierstrass\u2019 normal form\n$P(z) = 4 z^3 - g_2 z - g_3$.\n\nNote that\n$$R (z, \\sqrt{P(z)}) = \\frac{A(z) + B(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}}{C(z) + D(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}}$$\nfor suitable polynomials $A, B, C, D$. We can rationalize the\ndenominator like so:\n$$\\frac{A(z) + B(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}}{C(z) + D(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}} \\times \\frac{C(z) -\nD(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}}{C(z) - D(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}} = F(z) + G(z) \\sqrt{P(z)}$$\nThe rational functions $F$ and $G$ appearing in the foregoing equation\nare defined like so: $$\\begin{aligned}\n F(z) &=& \\frac{A(z) C(z) - B(z) D(z) P(z)}{C^2 (z) - D^2(z) P(z)} \\\\ G(z) &=& 2 \\frac{B(z) C(z) - A(z) D(z)}{C^2 (z) - D^2(z) P(z)} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $\\int F(z) \\, dz$ may be expressed in terms of elementary\nfunctions, we shall focus our attention on the remaining piece,\n$\\int G(z) \\sqrt{P(z)} \\, dz$, which we shall write as\n$\\int H(z) / \\sqrt{P(z)} \\, dz$, where $H = PG$.. Because we may\ndecompose $H$ into partial fractions, it suffices to consider the\nfollowing cases, which we shall all $A_n$ and $B_n$:\n$$A_n(z) = \\int \\frac{z^n}{\\sqrt{P(z)}} \\, dz$$\n$$B_n(z,r) = \\int \\frac{1}{(z - r)^n \\sqrt{P(z)}} \\, dz$$ Here, $n$ is a\nnon-negative integer and $r$ is a complex number.\n\nWe will reduce thes further using integration by parts. Taking\nantiderivatives, we have:\n$$\\int \\frac{z^{n-1} (zP'(z) + 2nP(z))}{2\\sqrt{P(z)}} \\, dz = z^n \\sqrt{P(z)} + C$$\n$$\\int \\frac{(z-r) P'(z) - 2nP(z)}{2(z-r)^{n+1} \\sqrt{P(z)}} \\, dz\n = \\frac{\\sqrt{P(z)}}{(z-r)^n} + C$$ These identities will allow us to\nexpress $A_n$\u2019s and $B_n$\u2019s with large $n$ in terms of ones with smaller\n$n$\u2019s.\n\nAt this point, it is convenient to employ the specific form of the\npolynominal $P$. We will first conside the Weierstrass normal form and\nthen the Jacobi normal form.\n\nSubstituting into our identities and collecting terms, we find\n$$4 (2n + 3) A_{n+2} = (2n + 1) g_2 A_n + 2n g_3 A_{n-1} + z^n \\sqrt{4z^3 - g_2 x - g_3} + C$$\n\n$$2n (4r^3 - g_2 r - g_3) B_{n+1} + (2n - 1) (12 r^2 - g_2) B_n \n  + 24 (n - 1) r B_{n-1} + 4(2n - 3) B_{n-2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{4z^3 - g_2 x - g_3}}{(z-r)^n} + C = 0$$\n\nNote that there are some cases which can be integrated in elementary\nterms. Namely, suppose that the power is odd:\n$$\\int z^{2m+1} \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\, dz$$ Then we may make\na change of variables $y = z^2$ to obtain\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\int y^{2m} \\sqrt{(1 - y) (1 - k^2 y)} \\, dy ,$$ which may\nbe integrated using elementary functions.\n\nNext, we derive some identities using integration by parts. Since\n$$d \\left( (1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2) \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\right) \n= \n\\left( \\frac{9}{2} k^2 z^3 - 3 (1 + k^2) z \\right)\n\\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\, dz ,$$ we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n (2 m + 1) &&\\int z^{2m} (1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2) \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - \nk^2 z^2)} \\, dz \\\\ + &&\\int z^{2m+1} \\left( \\frac{9}{2} k^2 z^3 - 3 (1 + k^2) z \\right)\n\\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\, dz \\\\\n= && z^{2m+1} (1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2) \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} + C \\end{aligned}$$\nBy colecting terms, this identity may be rewritten as follows:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n \\left( 1 + 2 m + \\frac{9}{2} k^2 \\right) &&\\int z^{2m+4} \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\, dz  - \\\\ (4 + 2 m) (1 + k^2) &&\\int z^{2m+2} \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} \\, dz + \\\\ &&\\int z^{2m} \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} = \\\\ && x^{2k+1} (1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2) \\sqrt{(1 - z^2) (1 - k^2 z^2)} + C \\end{aligned}$$\nBy repeated use of this identity, we may express any integral of the\nform $\\int z^{2m} \\sqrt{P(z)} \\, dz$ as the sum of a linear combination\nof $\\int z^2 \\sqrt{P(z)} \\, dz$ and $\\int \\sqrt{P(z)} \\, dz$ and the\nproduct of a polyomial and $\\sqrt{P(z)}$.\n\nLikewise, we can use integration by parts to simplify integrals of the\nform $$\\int \\frac{\\sqrt{P(z)}}{(z - r)^n} \\, dz$$\n\n*Will finish later \u2014 saving in case of computer crash.*",
