  "definition": "The hypergeometric equation is the following linear ordinary\ndifferential equation:\n$$x (1 - x) y'' + (c - (a + b + 1) x ) y' - aby = 0$$ (Here, $a$, $b$,\nand $c$ are complex constants.)\n\nThe solutions of this equation may be expressed in terms of the\nhypergeometric function, hence the name.\n\nThe hypergeometric equation is a Fuchsian differential equation with\nsingularities at $0$, $1$, and $\\infty$. By a suitable change of\nvariables, any second order Fuchsian differential equation may be\nconverted into a hypergeometric equation.",
