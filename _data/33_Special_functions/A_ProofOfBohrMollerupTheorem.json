Furthermore, note that since each term is monotonically\ndecreasing, $\\log \\Gamma$ is a decreasing function of $x$. If $x > m$\nfor some integer $m$, then we can bound the series term-by-term to\nobtain\n$${d^2 \\over dx^2} \\log \\Gamma (x) < \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty {1 \\over (m + n)^2} = \\sum_{n = m}^\\infty {1 \\over n^2}$$\nTherefore, as $x \\to \\infty$, $d^2 \\Gamma / dx^2 \\to 0$.\n\nNext, let $f$ satisfy the hypotheses of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem.\nConsider the function $g$ defined as $e^{g(x)} = f(x) / \\Gamma (x)$. By\nhypothesis 3, $g(1) = 0$. By hypothesis 2, $e^{g(x + 1)} = e^{g(x)}$, so\n$g(x+1) = g(x)$. In other , $g$ is periodic.\n\nSuppose that $g$ is not constant. Then there must exist points $x_0$ and\n$x_1$ on the real axis such that $g(x_0) \\neq g(x_1)$. Suppose that\n$g(x_1) > g(x_0)$ for definiteness. Since $g$ is periodic with period 1,\nwe may assume without loss of generality that $x_0 < x_1 < x_0 + 1$. Let\n$D_2$ denote the second divided difference of $g$:\n$$D_2 = \\Delta_2 (g; x_0, x_1, x_0 + 1) = - {g(x_0) \\over x_0 - x_1} + {g(x_1) \\over (x_1 - x_0)(x_1 - x_0 - 1)} - {g(x_0 + 1) \\over x_0 - x_1 + 1}$$\nBy our assumptions, $D_2 < 0$. By linearity,\n$$D_2 = \\Delta_2 (\\log f; x_0, x_1, x_0 + 1) - \\Delta_2 (\\log \\Gamma; x_0, x_1, x_0 + 1)$$\nBy periodicity, we have\n$$D_2 = \\Delta_2 (\\log f; x_0 + n, x_1 + n, x_0 + n + 1) - \\Delta_2 (\\log \\Gamma; x_0 + n, x_1 + n, x_0 + n + 1)$$\nfor every integer $n > 0$. However,\n$$|\\Delta_2 (\\log \\Gamma; x_0 + n, x_1 + n, x_0 + n + 1)| < \\max_{x_0 + n \\le x \\le x_0 + 1} {d^2 \\over dx^2} \\log \\Gamma (x)$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the right hand side approaches zero. Hence, by\nchoosing $n$ sufficiently large, we can make the left-hand side smaller\nthan $|D_2|/2$. For such an $n$,\n$$\\Delta_2 (\\log f; x_0 + n, x_1 + n, x_0 + n + 1) < 0$$ However, this\ncontradicts hypothesis 1. Therefore, $g$ must be constant. Since\n$g(0) = 0$, $g(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which implies that\n$e^0 = f(x) / \\Gamma(x)$. In other words, $f(x) = \\Gamma(x)$ as desired.",
