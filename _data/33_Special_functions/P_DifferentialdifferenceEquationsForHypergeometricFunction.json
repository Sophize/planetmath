  "statement": "The hypergeometric function satisfies several equations which relate\nderivatives with respect to the argument $z$ to shifting the parameters\n$a, b, c, d$ by unity (Here, the prime denotes derivative with respect\nto $z$.): $$\\begin{aligned}\nz F' (a, b; c; z) + a F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a+1, b; c; z) \\\\\nz F' (a, b; c; z) + b F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a, b+1; c; z) \\\\\nz F' (a, b; c; z) + (c-1) F (a, b; c; z) &= F (a, b; c-1; z) \\\\\n(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= (c - a) F (a-1, b; c; z) + (a - c + bz) F (a, b; c; z) \\\\\n(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= (c - b) F (a, b-1; c; z) + (b - c + az) F (a, b; c; z) \\\\\n(1 - z) z F' (a, b; c; z) &= z (c - a) (c - b) F (a, b; c+1; z) +\nzc (a + b - c) F (a, b; c; z)\\end{aligned}$$ These equations may readily\nbe verified by differentiating the series which defines the\nhypergeometric equation. By eliminating the derivatives between these\nequations, one obtains the contiguity relations for the hypergeometric\nfunction. By differentiating them once more and taking suitable linear\ncombinations, one may obtain the differential equation of the\nhypergeometric function.",
