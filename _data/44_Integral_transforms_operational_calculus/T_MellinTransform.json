  "definition": "The *Mellin transform* is an integral transform defined as follows:\n$$F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(t) t^{s-1} \\, dt$$ Intuitively, it may be\nviewed as a continuous analogue of a power series \u2014 instead of\nsynthetizing a function by summing multiples of integer powers, we\nintegrate over all real powers. This transform is closely related to the\nLaplace transform \u2014 if we make a change of variables $t = e^{-r}$ and\ndefine $g$ by $f(e^{-r}) = g(r)$, then the above integral becomes\n$$F(s) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} g(r) e^{-rs} \\, dr ,$$ which is a\nbilateral Laplace transform.\n\n(more to come)",
