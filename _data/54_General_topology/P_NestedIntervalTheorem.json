In either case, we have that $a_i\\le b_j$ for all\n    $i,j$. This means that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, \\ldots$\n    is bounded from above by all $b_i$, where $i=1,2,\\ldots$.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the sequence $(a_i)$ exists, and is just the\nsupremum, say $a$ (see proof ). Similarly the sequence $(b_i)$ is\nnonincreasing and bounded from below by all $a_i$, where $i=1,2,\\ldots$,\nand hence has an infimum $b$.\n\nNow, as the supremum of $(a_i)$, $a\\le b_i$ for all $i$. But because $b$\nis the infimum of $(b_i)$, $a\\le b$. Therefore, the interval $[a,b]$ is\nnon-empty (containing at least one of $a,b$). Since\n$a_i\\le a\\le b\\le b_i$, every interval $[a_i,b_i]$ contains the interval\n$[a,b]$, so their intersection also contains $[a,b]$, hence is\nnon-empty.\n\nIf $c$ is a point outside of $[a,b]$, say $c<a$, then there is some\n$a_i$, such that $c<a_i$ (by the definition of the supremum $a$), and\nhence $c\\notin [a_i,b_i]$. This shows that the intersection actually\ncoincides with $[a,b]$.\n\nNow, since $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(b_n-a_n) = 0$, we have that\n$b-a=\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}b_n - \\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = \\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(b_n-a_n) = 0$.\nSo $a=b$. This means that the intersection of the nested intervals\ncontains a single point $a$.\n\n**Remark**. This result is called the *nested interval theorem*. It is a\nrestatement of the *finite intersection property* for the compact set\n$[a_1,\\,b_1]$. The result may also be proven by elementary methods:\nnamely, any number lying in between the supremum of all the $a_n$ and\nthe infimum of all the $b_n$ will be in all the nested intervals.",
