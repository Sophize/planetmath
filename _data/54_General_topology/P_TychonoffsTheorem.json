  "statement": "Let $(X_i)_{i\\in I}$ be a family of nonempty topological spaces. The\nproduct space (see product topology) $$\\prod_{i\\in I}X_i$$ is compact if\nand only if each of the spaces $X_i$ is compact.\n\nNot surprisingly, if $I$ is infinite, the proof requires the Axiom of\nChoice. Conversely, one can show that Tychonoff\u2019s theorem implies that\nany product of nonempty sets is nonempty, which is one form of the Axiom\nof Choice.",
