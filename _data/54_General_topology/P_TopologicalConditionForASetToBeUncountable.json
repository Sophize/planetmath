  "statement": "A nonempty compact Hausdorff space with no isolated points is\nuncountable.\n\nLet $X$ be a nonempty compact Hausdorff space with no isolated points.\nTo each finite $0,1$-sequence $\\alpha$ associate a point $x_{\\alpha}$\nand an open neighbourhood $U_{\\alpha}$ as follows. First, since $X$ is\nnonempty, let $x_0$ be a point of $X$. Second, since $x_0$ is not\nisolated, let $x_1$ be another point of $X$. The fact that $X$ is\nHausdorff implies that $x_0$ and $x_1$ can be separated by open sets. So\nlet $U_0$ and $U_1$ be disjoint open neighborhoods of $x_0$ and $x_1$\nrespectively.\n\nNow suppose for induction that $x_{\\alpha}$ and a neighbourhood\n$U_{\\alpha}$ of $x_{\\alpha}$ have been constructed for all $\\alpha$ of\nlength less than $n$. A $0,1$-sequence of length $n$ has the form\n$(\\alpha,0)$ or $(\\alpha,1)$ for some $\\alpha$ of length $n-1$. Define\n$x_{(\\alpha,0)}=x_{\\alpha}$. Since $x_{(\\alpha,0)}$ is not isolated,\nthere is a point in $U_{\\alpha}$ besides $x_{(\\alpha,0)}$; call that\npoint $x_{(\\alpha,1)}$. Now apply the Hausdorff property to find\ndisjoint open neighbourhoods $U_{(\\alpha,0)}$ and $U_{(\\alpha,1)}$ of\n$x_{(\\alpha,0)}$ and $x_{(\\alpha,1)}$ respectively. The neighbourhoods\n$U_{(\\alpha,0)}$ and $U_{(\\alpha,1)}$ can be chosen to be proper subsets\nof $U_{\\alpha}$. Proceed by induction to find an\n$x_{\\alpha}\\in U_{\\alpha}$ for each finite $0,1$-sequence $\\alpha$.\n\n![The induction step: separating points in\n$U_{\\alpha}$.](picking_points.eps)\n\nNow define a function $f\\colon 2^{\\omega}\\to X$ as follows. If $\\alpha$\nis eventually zero, put $f(\\alpha)=x_{\\alpha}$. Otherwise, consider the\nsequence\n$(x_{(\\alpha_0)},x_{(\\alpha_0,\\alpha_1)},x_{(\\alpha_0,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)},\\dots)$\nof points in $X$. Since $X$ is compact and Hausdorff, it is closed and\nlimit point compact, so the sequence has a limit point in $X$. Let\n$f(\\alpha)$ be such a limit point. Observe that for each finite prefix\n$(\\alpha_0,\\dots,\\alpha_n)$ of $\\alpha$, the point $f(\\alpha)$ is in\n$U_{(\\alpha_0,\\dots,\\alpha_n)}$.\n\n![Defining $f(\\alpha)$ as a limit point of the\n$x_{(\\alpha_0,\\dots,\\alpha_n)}$.](limit_point.eps)\n\nSuppose $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are distinct sequences in $2^{\\omega}$. Let\n$n$ be the first position where $\\alpha_n\\ne\\beta_n$. Then\n$f(\\alpha)\\in U_{(\\alpha_0,\\dots,\\alpha_n)}$ and\n$f(\\beta)\\in U_{(\\beta_0,\\dots,\\beta_n)}$, and by construction\n$U_{(\\alpha_0,\\dots,\\alpha_n)}$ and $U_{(\\beta_0,\\dots,\\beta_n)}$ are\ndisjoint. Hence $f(\\alpha)\\ne f(\\beta)$, implying that $f$ is an\ninjective function. Since the set $2^{\\omega}$ is uncountable and $f$ is\nan injective function from $2^{\\omega}$ into $X$, $X$ is also\nuncountable.\n\nThe set $[0,1]$ is uncountable.\n\nBeing closed and bounded, $[0,1]$ is compact by the Heine-Borel Theorem;\nbecause $[0,1]$ is a subspace of the Hausdorff space $\\mathbb{R}$, it\ntoo is Hausdorff; finally, since $[0,1]$ has no isolated points, the\npreceding theorem implies that it is uncountable.",
