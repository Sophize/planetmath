  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is said to be *scattered* if for every closed\nsubset $C$ of $X$, the set of isolated points of $C$ is dense in $C$.\nEquivalently, $X$ is a scattered space if no non-empty closed subset of\n$X$ is dense in itself: for every closed subset $C$ of $X$, the closure\nof the interior of $C$ is not $C$.\n\nA subset of a topological space is called *scattered* if it is a\nscattered space with the subspace topology.\n\nEvery discrete space is scattered, since every singleton is open, hence\nisolated.\n\n. Let $\\mathbb{R}$ be the real line equipped with the usual topology $T$\n(formed by the open intervals). Let\u2019s define a new topology $S$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}$ as follows: a subset $A$ is open under $S$ ($A\\in S$) if\n$A=B\\cup C$, where $B$ is open under $T$ ($B\\in T$) and\n$C\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}-\\mathbb{Q}$, a subset of the irrational numbers.\nWe make the following observations:\n\n1.  $S$ is a topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ which is finer than $T$\n\n2.  $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Hausdorff space under $S$,\n\n3.  a singleton in $\\mathbb{R}$ is clopen iff it contains an irrational\n    number\n\n4.  any subset of irrationals is scattered under the subspace topology\n    of $\\mathbb{R}$ under $S$\n\n<!-- -->\n\n1.  First note that every element of $T$ is an element of $S$, so\n    $\\varnothing, \\mathbb{R}\\in S$ in particular. Suppose $A_1,A_2\\in S$\n    with $A_1=B_1\\cup C_1$ and $A_2=B_2\\cup C_2$, where $B_i,C_i$ are\n    defined as in the setup above. Then $A_1\\cap A_2= B\\cup C$, where\n    $B=B_1\\cap B_2\\in T$ and\n    $C=(C_1\\cap B_2)\\cup ((B_1\\cup C_1)\\cap C_2)$ is a subset of the\n    irrationals. So $A_1\\cap A_2\\in S$. If $A_i\\in S$ with\n    $A_i=B_i\\cup C_i$, then\n    $\\bigcup A_i=\\bigcup B_i\\cup \\bigcup C_i\\in S$. So $S$ is a topology\n    which is finer than $T$\n\n2.  $\\mathbb{R}$ is Hausdorff under $S$ is clear, the topological\n    property is inherited from $T$.\n\n3.  First, any singleton is closed since $X$ is Hausdorff under $S$. If\n    $x$ is irrational, then $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is open (under $S$) as\n    well. So $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is clopen. If $x$ is rational and\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace\\in S$, then it is the union of a $T$-open set $B$\n    and a subset $C$ of the irrationals. The only $T$-open subset of\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is the empty set, so $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is a\n    subset of the irrationals, a contradiction.\n\n4.  Let $C$ is a subset of the irrational numbers. and considered the\n    subspace topology under $S$. Then every point $r$ of $C$ is\n    isolated, since $\\lbrace r\\rbrace$ is the open subset of $C$\n    separating it from the rest. The closure of the collection of these\n    points is clearly $C$ itself, so $C$ is scattered.\n\nThe real line under the topology $S$ is called a *scattered line*.\n\n**Remark**. Every topological space is a disjoint union of a perfect set\nand a scattered set.",
