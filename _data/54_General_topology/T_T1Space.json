  "definition": "A topological space $(X,\\tau)$ is said to be $T_1$ (or said to hold the\n$T_1$ axiom) if for all distinct points $x,y\\in X$ ($x\\neq y$), there\nexists an open set $U\\in\\tau$ such that $x\\in U$ and $y\\notin U$.\n\nA space being $T_1$ is equivalent to the following statements:\n\n-   For every $x\\in X$, the set $\\{x\\}$ is closed.\n\n-   Every subset of $X$ is equal to the intersection of all the open\n    sets that contain it.\n\n-   Distinct points are separated.",
