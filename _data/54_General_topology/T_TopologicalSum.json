  "definition": "Given two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, their *topological sum* is\ndefined to be the set $X \\coprod Y$ (see the entry *disjoint union*)\nequipped with the finest topology such that the inclusion maps from $X$\nand $Y$ into $X \\coprod Y$ are continuous. A basis for this topology\nconsists of the union of the set of open subsets of $X$ and the set of\nopen subsets of $Y$.",
