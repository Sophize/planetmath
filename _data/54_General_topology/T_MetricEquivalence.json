  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set equipped with two metrics $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$. We say\nthat $\\rho$ is *equivalent* to $\\sigma$ (on $X$) if the identity map on\n$X$, is a homeomorphism between the metric topology on $X$ induced by\n$\\rho$ and the metric topology on $X$ induced by $\\sigma$.\n\nFor example, if $(X,\\rho)$ is a metric space, then the function\n$\\sigma: X\\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma(x,y):=\\frac{\\rho(x,y)}{1+\\rho(x,y)}$$ is a metric on $X$ that\nis equivalent to $\\rho$. This shows that every metric is equivalent to a\nbounded metric.",
