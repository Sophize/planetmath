  "definition": "A topological space $(X, \\tau)$ is called a *hemicompact* space if there\nis an *admissible sequence* in $X$, i.e. there is a sequence of compact\nsets $(K_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ in $X$ such that for every $K \\subset X$\ncompact there is an $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $K \\subset K_n$.\n\n-   The above conditions imply that if $X$ is hemicompact with\n    admissible sequence $(K_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ then\n    $X = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} K_n$ because every point of $X$ is\n    compact and lies in one of the $K_n$.\n\n-   A hemicompact space is clearly $\\sigma$-compact. The converse is\n    false in general. This follows from the fact that a first countable\n    hemicompact space is locally compact (see below). Consider the set\n    of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the induced euclidean\n    topology. $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\sigma$-compact but not hemicompact.\n    Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies the first axiom of countability it\n    can\u2019t be hemicompact as this would imply local compactness.\n\n-   Not every locally compact space (like $\\mathbb{R}$) is hemicompact.\n    Take for example an uncountable discrete space. If we assume in\n    addition $\\sigma$-compactness we obtain a hemicompact space (see\n    below).\n\n**Proposition.** Let $(X, \\tau)$ be a first countable hemicompact space.\nThen $X$ is locally compact.\n\nLet $\\cdots \\subset K_n \\subset K_{n+1} \\subset \\cdots$ be an admissible\nsequence of $X$. Assume for contradiction that there is an $x \\in X$\nwithout compact neighborhood. Let $U_n \\supset U_{n+1} \\supset \\cdots$\nbe a countable basis for the neighbourhoods of $x$. For every\n$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ choose a point $x_n \\in U_n \\setminus K_n$. The set\n$K := \\{x_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\cup \\{x\\}$ is compact but there is no\n$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $K \\subset K_n$. We have a contradiction.\n\n**Proposition.** Let $(X, \\tau)$ be a locally compact and\n$\\sigma$-compact space. Then $X$ is hemicompact.\n\nBy local compactness we choose a cover $X \\subset \\bigcup_{i \\in I} U_i$\nof open sets with compact closure (take a compact neighborhood of every\npoint). By $\\sigma$-compactness there is a sequence\n$(K_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of compacts such that\n$X = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} K_n$. To each $K_n$ there is a finite\nsubfamily of $(U_i)_{i \\in I}$ which covers $K_n$. Denote the union of\nthis finite family by $U_n$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Set\n$\\tilde{K}_n := \\overline{\\bigcup_{k=1}^n U_k}$. Then\n$(\\tilde{K}_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of compacts. Let\n$K \\subset X$ be compact then there is a finite subfamily of\n$(U_i)_{i \\in I}$ covering $K$. Therefore $K \\subset K_n$ for some\n$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",
