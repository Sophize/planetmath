  "statement": "The Stone representation theorem characterizes a Boolean algebra as a\nfield of sets in a topological space. There is also a dual to this\nfamous theorem that characterizes a Boolean space as a topological space\nconstructed from a Boolean algebra.\n\nLet $X$ be a Boolean space. Then there is a Boolean algebra $B$ such\nthat $X$ is homeomorphic to $B^*$, the of $B$.\n\nThe choice for $B$ is clear: it is the set of clopen sets in $X$ which,\nvia the set theoretic operations of intersection, union, and complement,\nis a Boolean algebra.\n\nNext, define a function $f:X \\to B^*$ by\n$$f(x):=\\lbrace U \\in B \\mid x\\notin U\\rbrace.$$ Our ultimate goal is to\nprove that $f$ is the desired homeomorphism. We break down the proof of\nthis into several stages:\n\n$f$ is well-defined.\n\nThe key is to show that $f(x)$ is a prime ideal in $B^*$ for any\n$x\\in X$. To see this, first note that if $U,V\\in f(x)$, then so is\n$U\\cup V \\in f(x)$, and if $W$ is any clopen set of $X$, then\n$U\\cap W\\in f(x)$ too. Finally, suppose that $U\\cap V\\in f(x)$. Then\n$x\\in X-(U\\cap V)=(X-U)\\cup (X-V)$, which means that $x\\notin U$ or\n$x\\notin V$, which is the same as saying that $U\\in f(x)$ or\n$V\\in f(x)$. Hence $f(x)$ is a prime ideal, or a maximal ideal, since\n$B$ is Boolean.\n\n$f$ is injective.\n\nSuppose $x\\ne y$, we want to show that $f(x)\\ne f(y)$. Since $X$ is\nHausdorff, there are disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $x\\in U$ and\n$y\\in V$. Since $X$ is also totally disconnected, $U$ and $V$ are unions\nof clopen sets. Hence we may as well assume that $U,V$ clopen. This then\nimplies that $U\\in f(y)$ and $V\\in f(x)$. Since $U\\ne V$,\n$f(x)\\ne f(y)$.\n\n$f$ is surjective.\n\nPick any maximal ideal $I$ of $B^*$. We want to find an $x\\in X$ such\nthat $f(x)=I$. If no such $x$ exists, then for every $x\\in X$, there is\nsome clopen set $U\\in I$ such that $x\\in U$. This implies that\n$\\bigcup I = X$. Since $X$ is compact, $X=\\bigcup J$ for some finite set\n$J\\subseteq I$. Since $I$ is an ideal, and $X$ is a finite join of\nelements of $I$, we see that $X\\in I$. But this would mean that $I=B^*$,\ncontradicting the fact that $I$ is a maximal, hence a proper ideal of\n$B^*$.\n\n$f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.\n\nWe use a fact about continuous functions between two Boolean spaces:\n\n> a bijection is a homeomorphism iff it maps clopen sets to clopen sets\n> (proof ).\n\nSo suppose that $U$ is clopen in $X$, we want to prove that $f(U)$ is\nclopen in $B^*$. In other words, there is an element $V\\in B$ (so that\n$V$ is clopen in $X$) such that\n$$f(U)=M(V)=\\lbrace M\\in B^* \\mid V\\notin M\\rbrace.$$ This is because\nevery clopen set in $B^*$ has the form $M(V)$ for some $V\\in B^*$ (see\nthe lemma in ). Now,\n$f(U)= \\lbrace f(x)\\mid x\\in U\\rbrace = \\lbrace f(x)\\mid U\\notin f(x)\\rbrace = \\lbrace M\\mid U\\notin M\\rbrace$,\nthe last equality is based on the fact that $f$ is a bijection. Thus by\nsetting $V=U$ completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nTherefore, $f$ is a homemorphism, and the proof of theorem is complete.",
