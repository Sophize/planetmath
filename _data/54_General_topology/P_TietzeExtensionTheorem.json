  "statement": "Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $X$ is normal.\n\n2.  If $A$ is a closed subset in $X$, and $f\\colon A\\to [-1,1]$ is a\n    continuous function, then $f$ has a continuous to all of $X$. (In\n    other words, there is a continuous function\n    $f^\\ast\\colon X\\to [-1,1]$ such that $f$ and $f^\\ast$ coincide on\n    $A$.)\n\n*Remark:* If $X$ and $A$ are as above, and $f\\colon A\\to(-1,1)$ is a\ncontinuous function, then $f$ has a continuous to all of $X$.\n\nThe present result can be found in [@mukherjea].\n\n[9]{} A.
