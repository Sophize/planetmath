  "definition": "Let $(X,\\leq)$ be a linearly ordered set. The *order topology* on $X$ is\ndefined to be the topology $\\mathcal{T}$ generated by the subbasis\nconsisting of open rays, that is sets of the form\n$$(x,\\infty)=\\{ y\\in X|y>x\\}$$ $$(-\\infty,x)=\\{ y\\in X|y<x\\},$$ for some\n$x\\in X$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that $\\mathcal{T}$ is generated by the\nbasis of open intervals; that is, the open rays as defined above,\ntogether with sets of the form $$(x,y)=\\{ z\\in X|x<z<y\\}$$ for some\n$x,y\\in X$.\n\nThe standard topologies on $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{N}$\nare the same as the order topologies on these sets.\n\nIf $Y$ is a subset of $X$, then $Y$ is a linearly ordered set under the\ninduced order from $X$. Therefore, $Y$ has an order topology\n$\\mathcal{S}$ defined by this ordering, the *induced order topology*.\nMoreover, $Y$ has a subspace topology $\\mathcal{T}'$ which it inherits\nas a subspace of the topological space $X$. The subspace topology is\nalways finer than the induced order topology, but they are not in\ngeneral the same.\n\nFor example, consider the subset\n$Y=\\{ -1\\}\\cup\\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Q}$.\nUnder the subspace topology, the singleton set $\\{ -1\\}$ is open in $Y$,\nbut under the order topology on $Y$, any open set containing $-1$ must\ncontain all but finitely many members of the space.\n\nA chain $X$ under the order topology is Hausdorff: pick any two distinct\npoints $x, y \\in X$; without loss of generality, say $x < y$. If there\nis a $z$ such that $x < z < y$, then $(-\\infty,z)$ and $(z,\\infty)$ are\ndisjoint open sets separating $x$ and $y$. If no $z$ were between $x$\nand $y$, then $(-\\infty,y)$ and $(x,\\infty)$ are disjoint open sets\nseparating $x$ and $y$.",
