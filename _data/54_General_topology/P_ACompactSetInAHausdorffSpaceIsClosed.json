The case\nwhen $A$ is empty is trivial, so let us assume that $A$ is non-empty.\nUsing , it follows that each point $y$ in $A^{{\\complement}}$ has a\nneighborhood $U_y$, which is disjoint to $A$. (Here, we denote the\ncomplement of $A$ by $A^{{\\complement}}$.) We can therefore write\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nA^{{\\complement}} &=& \\bigcup_{y\\in A^{{\\complement}}} U_y.\\end{aligned}$$\nSince an arbitrary union of open sets is open, it follows that $A$ is\nclosed. $\\Box$\n\n[**Note.**]{}\u00c2\u00a0\\\nThe above theorem can, for instance, be found in [@kelley] (page 141),\nor [@singer] (Section 2.1, Theorem 2).\n\n[9]{} J.L.
