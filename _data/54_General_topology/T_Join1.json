  "definition": "Given two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, their [*join,*]{} denoted by\n$X\\star Y,$ is defined to be the quotient space\n$$X\\star Y := X{\\times}[0,1]{\\times}Y/\\sim,$$ where the equivalence\nrelation $\\sim$ is generated by $$\\begin{aligned}\n(x,0,y_1)& \\sim (x,0,y_2) &\\text{for any}\\, x\\in X,\\, y_1,y_2\\in Y,\\, \\text{and}\\\\\n(x_1,1,y)& \\sim (x_2,1,y) &\\text{for any}\\, y\\in Y,\\, x_1,x_2\\in X.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nIntuitively, $X\\star Y$ is formed by taking the disjoint union of the\ntwo spaces and attaching a line segment joining every point in $X$ to\nevery point in $Y.$\n\nSome examples:\n\n-   The join of a space $X$ with a one-point space is called the *cone*\n    of $X$.\n\n-   The join of the spheres $S^n$ and $S^m$ is the sphere $S^{n+m+1}$.",
