  "definition": "A sequence $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ is a *Cauchy\nsequence* if, for every real number $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a\nnatural number $N$ such that $d(x_n,x_m) < \\epsilon$ whenever $n,m > N$.\n\nLikewise, a sequence $v_0, v_1, v_2, \\dots$ in a topological vector\nspace $V$ is a *Cauchy sequence* if and only if for every neighborhood\n$U$ of $\\mathbf{0}$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that\n$v_n - v_m \\in U$ for all $n,m > N$. These two definitions are\nequivalent when the topology of $V$ is induced by a metric.",
