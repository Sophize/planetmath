  "definition": "Let $X_i$, $i\\in I$ be any family of topological spaces. We say that a\ntopology $\\mathcal T$ on $X$ is initial with respect to the family of\nmappings ${f_i\\colonX\\toX_i}$, $i\\in I$, if $\\mathcal T$ is the coarsest\ntopology on $X$ which makes all $f_i$\u2019s continuous.\n\nThe initial topology is characterized by the condition that a map\n${g\\colonY\\toX}$ is continuous if and only if every\n${f_i \\circ g\\colonY\\toX_i}$ is continuous.\n\nSets $\\mathcal S=\\{f_i^{-1}(U): U$ is open in $X_i\\}$ form a subbase for\nthe initial topology, their finite intersections form a base.\n\nE.g. the product topology is initial with respect to the and a subspace\ntopology is initial with respect to the embedding.\n\nThe initial topology is sometimes called topology generated by a family\nof mappings [@engelking], weak topology [@willard] or projective\ntopology. (The weak topology is used mainly in functional analysis.)\n\nFrom the viewpoint of category theory, the initial topology is an\ninitial source. (Initial structures, which are a natural generalization\nof the initial topology, play an important r\u00f4le in topological\ncategories and categorical topology.)\n\n[9]{} J.\u00a0Ad\u00e1mek, H.\u00a0Herrlich, and G.\u00a0Strecker, *Abstract and concrete\ncategories*, Wiley, New York, 1990.\n\nR.\u00a0Engelking, *General topology*, PWN, Warsaw, 1977.\n\nM.\u00a0Hu\u0161ek, *Categorical topology*, Encyclopedia of General Topology\n(K.\u00a0P.
