Equivalently it is enough to prove that $B'=Y\\setminus B$ is\nclosed.\n\nSince $f$ is bijective we have $B' = Y\\setminus B = f(X\\setminus A)$\n\nAs $A'=X\\setminus A$ is closed and since $X$ is compact $A'$ is compact\ntoo (this and the following are well know properties of compact spaces).\nMoreover being $f$ continuous we know that also $B'=f(A')$ is compact.\nFinally since $Y$ is Hausdorff then $B'$ is closed.",
