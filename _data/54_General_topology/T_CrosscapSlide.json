  "definition": "The [**crosscap slide**]{} is an autohomeomorphism which can be defined\nonly for [**non orientable surfaces**]{} whose genus is greater than\none.\n\nIt is also known as the y-homeomorphism. This name was coined by\nLickorish and the name crosscap slide was introduced by Korkmaz.\n\n1.  D.R.J. Chillingworth.
