  "definition": "Let $X$ be a locally compact space. A function\n$f:X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is said to *vanish at infinity* if, for\nevery $\\epsilon > 0$, there is a compact set $K \\subseteq X$ such that\n$|f(x)|<\\epsilon$ for every $x \\in X-K$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the\nstandard on $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nIf $X$ is non-compact, let $X \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ be the one-point\ncompactification of $X$. The above definition can be rephrased as: The\nextension of $f$ to $X \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ satisfying $f(\\infty)=0$ is\ncontinuous at the point $\\infty$.\n\nThe set of continuous functions $X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ that\nvanish at infinity is an algebra over the complex field and is usually\ndenoted by $C_0(X)$.\n\n### Remarks\n\n-   When $X$ is compact, all functions $X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$\n    vanish at infinity. Hence, $C_0(X) = C(X)$.",
