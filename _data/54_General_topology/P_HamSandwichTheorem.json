  "statement": "Let $A_1,\\ldots,A_m$ be measurable bounded subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\nThen there exists an $(m-1)$-dimensional hyperplane which each $A_i$\ninto two subsets of equal measure.\n\nThis theorem has such a colorful because in the case $m=3$ it can be\nviewed as cutting a ham sandwich in half. For example, $A_1$ and $A_3$\ncould be two pieces of bread and $A_2$ a piece of ham. According to this\ntheorem it is possible to make one to simultaneously all three objects\nexactly in half.",
