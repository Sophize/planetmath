  "statement": "Suppose $X,Y$ are topological space and let $Z\\subseteq  Y$ be equipped\nwith the subspace topology. If $$f\\colon X\\to Z$$ is continuous, then\n$$f\\colon X\\to Y$$ is continuous.\n\nLet $U\\subseteq Y$ be an open set. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n  f^{-1}(U) &=& \\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in U\\} \\\\\n            &=& \\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in U\\cap Z\\} \\\\\n            &=& f^{-1}(U\\cap Z).\\end{aligned}$$ Since $U\\cap Z$ is open\nin $Z$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.",
