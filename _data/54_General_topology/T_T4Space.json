  "definition": "[@steen] Suppose $X$ is a topological space. Further, suppose that for\nany two disjoint closed sets $A,B\\subseteq X$, there are two disjoint\nopen sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A\\subseteq U$ and $B\\subseteq V$. Then\nwe say that $X$ is a *$T_4$ space*.\n\n### Notes {#notes .unnumbered}\n\nIt should be pointed out that there is no standard convention for\nseparation axioms in topology. The above definition follows [@steen].\nHowever, in some references (e.g. [@kelley]) the meaning of $T_4$ and\nnormal are exchanged.\n\n[9]{} L.A.
