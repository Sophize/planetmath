  "definition": "A subset in a topological space is *precompact* if its closure is\ncompact [@lee].\n\nFor metric spaces, we have the following theorem due to Hausdorff\n[@cristescu].\n\n[**Theorem**]{} Suppose $K$ is a set in a complete metric space $X$.\nThen $K$ relatively compact if and only if for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there\nis a finite for $K$.\n\n### Examples {#examples .unnumbered}\n\n1.  In ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ every point has a precompact neighborhood.\n\n2.  On a manifold, every point has a precompact neighborhood. This\n    follows from the previous example, since a homeomorphism commutes\n    with the closure operator, and since the continuous image of a\n    compact set is compact.\n\n### Notes {#notes .unnumbered}\n\nA synonym is *relatively compact* [@cristescu; @kreyszig].\n\nSome authors (notably Bourbaki see [@bour]) use precompact differently -\nas a synonym for (in the generality of topological groups). \u201cRelatively\ncompact\u201d is then used to mean \u201cprecompact \u201das it is defined here\n\n[9]{} J.M.
