  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is said to be [*extremally disconnected*]{} if\nevery open set in $X$ has an open closure.\n\nIt can be shown that $X$ is extremally disconnected iff any two disjoint\nopen sets in $X$ have disjoint closures. Every extremally disconnected\nspace is totally disconnected.\n\n#### Notes\n\nSome authors like [@willard] and [@kelley] use the above definition as\nis, while others (e.g.\u00a0[@steen; @bourbaki]) require that an extremally\ndisconnected space should (in addition to the above condition) also be a\nHausdorff space.\n\n[9]{} S.\u00a0Willard, *General Topology*, Addison-Wesley, Publishing\nCompany, 1970.
