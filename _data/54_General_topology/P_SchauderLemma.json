  "statement": "The following theorem is in the functional analysis literature generally\nreferred to as the *Schauder lemma*. It is a version of the open mapping\ntheorem in Fr\u00e9chet spaces and is often used to verify the open-ness of\nlinear, continuous maps.\n\n**Theorem.** Let $E, F$ be Fr\u00e9chet spaces. Denote by\n$\\mathcal{U}_0(E), \\mathcal{U}_0(F)$ the zero neighborhood filter of $E$\nand $F$ respectively. Let $T \\colon E \\to F$ be a linear and continuous\nmap which is *almost open*, i.e. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\forall_{U \\in \\mathscr{U}_0(E)} \\overline{T(U)}^{F} &\\in \\mathscr{U}_0(F)\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThen $T$ is open.",
