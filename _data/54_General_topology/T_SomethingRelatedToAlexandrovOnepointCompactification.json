  "definition": "The topology for $X\\bigcup \\{\\infty\\}$ is defined as follows: there are\ntwo kinds of open sets of $X\\bigcup \\{\\infty\\}$. If $\\infty \\notin U$,\nthen $U$ is open if and only if $U$ is an open set in the topology of\n$X$. If $\\infty \\in U$, then $U$ is open if and only if $U$ is the\ncomplement of a closed compact subset $K$ of $X$.",
