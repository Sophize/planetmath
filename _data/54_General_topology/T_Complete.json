  "definition": "A metric space $X$ is [*complete*]{} if every in $X$ is a convergent\nsequence.\n\n[**Examples:**]{}\n\n-   The space $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is not complete: the\n    sequence $3$, $3.1$, $3.14$, $3.141$, $3.1415$, $3.14159$,\n    $3.141592\\ldots$ consisting of finite decimals converging to\n    $\\pi \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that does\n    not converge in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n-   The space $\\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers is complete, as it is the\n    completion of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the standard metric\n    (other completions, such as the $p$-adic numbers, are also\n    possible). More generally, the completion of any metric space is a\n    complete metric space.\n\n-   Every Banach space is complete. For example, the $L^p$\u2013space of\n    p-integrable functions is a complete metric space if $p \\geq 1$.",
