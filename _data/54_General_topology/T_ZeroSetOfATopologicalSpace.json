  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space and $f\\in C(X)$, the ring of continuous\nfunctions on $X$. The *level set* of $f$ at $r\\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the set\n$f^{-1}(r):=\\lbrace x\\in X\\mid f(x)=r\\rbrace$. The *zero set* of $f$ is\ndefined to be the level set of $f$ at $0$. The zero set of $f$ is\ndenoted by $Z(f)$. A subset $A$ of $X$ is called a *zero set* of $X$ if\n$A=Z(f)$ for some $f\\in C(X)$.\n\n**Properties**. Let $X$ be a topological space and, unless otherwise\nspecified, $f\\in C(X)$.\n\n1.  Any zero set of $X$ is closed. The converse is not true. However, if\n    $X$ is a metric space, then any closed set $A$ is a zero set: simply\n    define $f:X\\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x):=d(x,A)$ where $d$ is the metric\n    on $X$.\n\n2.  The level set of $f$ at $r$ is the zero set of $f-\\hat{r}$, where\n    $\\hat{r}$ is the constant function valued at $r$.\n\n3.  $Z(\\hat{r})=X$ iff $r=0$. Otherwise, $Z(\\hat{r})=\\varnothing$. In\n    fact, $Z(f)=\\varnothing$ iff $f$ is a unit in the ring $C(X)$.\n\n4.  Since $f(a)=0$ iff $|f(a)|<\\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n    and each $\\lbrace x\\in X \\mid |f(x)|<\\frac{1}{n} \\rbrace$ is open in\n    $X$, we see that\n    $$Z(f)=\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\lbrace x\\in X \\mid |f(x)|<\\frac{1}{n} \\rbrace.$$\n    This shows every zero set is a set.\n\n5.  For any $f\\in C(X)$, $Z(f)=Z(f^n)=Z(|f|)$, where $n$ is any positive\n    integer.\n\n6.  $Z(fg)=Z(f)\\cup Z(g)$.\n\n7.  $Z(f)\\cap Z(g)=Z(f^2+g^2)=Z(|f|+|g|)$.\n\n8.  $\\lbrace x\\in X\\mid 0\\le f(x)\\rbrace$ is a zero set, since it is\n    equal to $Z(f-|f|)$.\n\n9.  If $C(X)$ is considered as an algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$, then\n    $Z(rf)=Z(f)$ iff $r\\ne 0$.\n\nThe complement of a zero set is called a *cozero set*. In other words, a\ncozero set looks like $\\lbrace x\\in X\\mid f(x)\\ne 0\\rbrace$ for some\n$f\\in C(X)$. By the last property above, a cozero set also has the form\n$\\operatorname{pos}(f):=\\lbrace x\\in X\\mid 0<f(x)\\rbrace$ for some\n$f\\in C(X)$.\n\nLet $A$ be a subset of $C(X)$. The *zero set* of $A$ is defined as the\nset of all zero sets of elements of $A$:\n$Z(A):=\\lbrace Z(f)\\mid f\\in A\\rbrace$. When $A=C(X)$, we also write\n$Z(X):=Z(C(X))$ and call it *the family of zero sets* of $X$. Evidently,\n$Z(X)$ is a subset of the family of all closed $G_{\\delta}$ sets of $X$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   By properties 6. and 7. above, $Z(X)$ is closed under set union and\n    set intersection operations. It can be shown that $Z(X)$ is also\n    closed under countable intersections.\n\n-   It is also possible to define a zero set of $X$ to be the zero set\n    of some $f\\in C^*(X)$, the subring of $C(X)$ consisting of the\n    bounded continuous functions into $\\mathbb{R}$. However, this\n    definition turns out to be equivalent to the one given for $C(X)$,\n    by the observation that $Z(f)=Z(|f|\\wedge \\hat{1})$.\n\n[7]{} L. Gillman, M.
