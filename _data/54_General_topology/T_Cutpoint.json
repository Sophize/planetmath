  "definition": "[**Theorem**]{} Suppose $X$ is a connected space and $x$ is a point in\n$X$. If $X\\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a disconnected set in $X$, then $x$ is a\n[**cut-point**]{} of $X$ [@jameson; @ward].\n\n### Examples\n\n1.  Any point of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ with the usual topology is a cut-point.\n\n2.  If $X$ is a normed vector space with $\\dim X>1$, then $X$ has no\n    cut-points [@jameson].\n\n[9]{} G.J.
