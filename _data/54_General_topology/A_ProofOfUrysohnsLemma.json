  "argumentText": "First we construct a family $U_p$ of open sets of $X$ indexed by the\nrationals such that if $ p < q$, then $\\bar{U_p} \\subseteq U_q$. These\nare the sets we will use to define our continuous function.\n\nLet $P = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$. Since $P$ is countable, we can use\ninduction (or recursive definition if you prefer) to define the sets\n$U_p$. List the elements of $P$ is an infinite sequence in some way; let\nus assume that $1$ and $0$ are the first two elements of this sequence.\nNow, define $U_1 = X \\backslash D$ (the complement of $D$ in $X$). Since\n$C$ is a closed set of $X$ contained in $U_1$, by normality of $X$ we\ncan choose an open set $U_0$ such that $C\n\\subseteq U_0$ and $\\bar{U_0} \\subseteq U_1$.\n\nIn general, let $P_n$ denote the set consisting of the first $n$\nrationals in our sequence. Suppose that $U_p$ is defined for all $p\n\\in P_n$ and\n$$\\textrm{if} \\ p < q, \\textrm{then} \\ \\bar{U_p} \\subseteq U_q.$$ Let\n$r$ be the next rational number in the sequence. Consider $P_{n+1}\n= P_n \\cup \\{r\\}$. It is a finite subset of $[0,1]$ so it inherits the\nusual ordering $<$ of $\\mathbb{R}$. In such a set, every element (other\nthan the smallest or largest) has an immediate predecessor and\nsuccessor. We know that $0$ is the smallest element and $1$ the largest\nof $P_{n+1}$ so $r$ cannot be either of these. Thus $r$ has an immediate\npredecessor $p$ and an immediate successor $q$ in $P_{n+1}$. The sets\n$U_p$ and $U_q$ are already defined by the inductive hypothesis so using\nthe normality of $X$, there exists an open set $U_r$ of $X$ such that\n$$\\bar{U_p} \\subseteq U_r \\ \\textrm{and} \\ \\bar{U_r} \\subseteq U_q.$$We\nnow show that (1) holds for every pair of elements in $P_{n+1}$. If both\nelements are in $P_n$, then (1) is true by the inductive hypothesis. If\none is $r$ and the other $s \\in P_n$, then if $s \\le p$ we have\n$$\\bar{U_s} \\subseteq \\bar{U_p} \\subseteq U_r$$ and if $s \\ge q$ we have\n$$\\bar{U_r} \\subseteq U_q \\subseteq U_s.$$ Thus (1) holds for ever pair\nof elements in $P_{n+1}$ and therefore by induction, $U_p$ is defined\nfor all $p \\in P$.\n\nWe have defined $U_p$ for all rationals in $[0,1]$. Extend this\ndefinition to every rational $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by defining\n$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        U_p = \\emptyset & \\textrm{if} \\ p < 0 \\\\\n        U_p = X & \\textrm{if} \\ p > 1.\n    \\end{array}$$ Then it is easy to check that (1) still holds.\n\nNow, given $x \\in X$, define $\\mathbb{Q}(x) = \\{p : x \\in U_p\\}$. This\nset contains no number less than $0$ and contains every number greater\nthan $1$ by the definition of $U_p$ for $p < 0$ and $p > 1$. Thus\n$\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ is bounded below and its infimum is an element in\n$[0,1]$. Define $$f(x) = \\textrm{inf} \\ \\mathbb{Q}(x).$$\n\nFinally we show that this function $f$ we have defined satisfies the\nconditions of lemma. If $x \\in C$, then $x \\in U_p$ for all $p \\ge 0$ so\n$\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ equals the set of all nonnegative rationals and\n$f(x) = 0$. If $x \\in D$, then $x \\notin U_p$ for $p \\le 1$ so\n$\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ equals all the rationals greater than 1 and $f(x) =\n1$.\n\nTo show that $f$ is continuous, we first prove two smaller results:\n\n\\(a) $x \\in \\bar{U_r} \\Rightarrow f(x) \\le r$\n\n*Proof*. If $x \\in \\bar{U_r}$, then $x \\in U_s$ for all $s > r$ so\n$\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ contains all rationals greater than $r$. Thus $f(x)\n\\le r$ by definition of $f$.\n\n\\(b) $x \\notin U_r \\Rightarrow f(x) \\ge r$.\n\n*Proof*. If $x \\notin U_r$, then $x \\notin U_s$ for all $s < r$ so\n$\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ contains no rational less than $r$. Thus $f(x) \\ge\nr$.\n\nLet $x_0 \\in X$ and let $(c,d)$ be an open interval of $\\mathbb{R}$\ncontaining $f(x)$. We will find a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that\n$f(U) \\subseteq (c,d)$. Choose $p,q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that\n$$c < p < f(x_0) < q < d.$$ Let $U = U_q \\backslash \\bar{U_p}$. Then\nsince $f(x_0) < q$, (b) implies that $x \\in U_q$ and since $f(x_0) > p$,\n(a) implies that $x_0\n\\notin \\bar{U_p}$. Hence $x_0 \\in U$.\n\nFinally, let $x \\in U$. Then $x \\in U_q \\subseteq \\bar{U_q}$, so $f(x)\n\\le q$ by (a). Also, $x \\notin \\bar{U_p}$ so $x \\notin U_p$ and $f(x)\n\\ge p$ by (b). Thus $$f(x) \\in [p,q] \\subseteq (c,d)$$ as desired.\nTherefore $f$ is continuous and we are done.",
