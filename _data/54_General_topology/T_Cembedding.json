  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space, and $C(X)$ the ring of continuous\nfunctions on $X$. A subspace $A\\subseteq X$ is said to be *$C$-embedded*\n(in $X$) if every function in $C(A)$ can be extended to a function in\n$C(X)$. More precisely, for every real-valued continuous function\n$f:A\\to \\mathbb{R}$, there is a real-valued continuous function\n$g:X\\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\\in A$.\n\nIf $A\\subseteq X$ is $C$-embedded, $f\\mapsto g$ (defined above) is an\nembedding of $C(A)$ into $C(X)$ by axiom of choice, and hence the\nnomenclature.\n\nSimilarly, one may define *$C^*$-embedding* on subspaces of a\ntopological space. Recall that for a topological space $X$, $C^*(X)$ is\nthe ring of bounded continuous functions on $X$. A subspace\n$A\\subseteq X$ is said to be *$C^*$-embedded* (in $X$) if every\n$f\\in C^*(A)$ can be extended to some $g\\in C^*(X)$.\n\n**Remarks**. Let $A$ be a subspace of $X$.\n\n1.  If $A$ is $C$-embedded in $X$, and $A\\subseteq Y\\subseteq X$, then\n    $A$ is $C$-embedded in $Y$. This is also true for\n    $C^*$-embeddedness.\n\n2.  If $A$ is $C$-embedded, then $A$ is $C^*$-embedded: for if $f$ is a\n    bounded continuous function on $A$, say $-n\\le f\\le n$, and $g$ is\n    its continuous extension on $X$, then $-n\\vee (g\\wedge n)$ is a\n    bounded continuous extension of $f$ on $X$.\n\n3.  The converse, however, is not true in general. A necessary and\n    sufficient condition that a $C^*$-embedded set $A$ is $C$-embedded\n    is:\n\n    if a zero set is disjoint from $A$, the it is completely separated\n    from $A$.\n\n    Since any pair of disjoint zero sets are completely separated, we\n    have that if $A$ is a $C^*$-embedded zero set, then $A$ is\n    $C$-embedded.\n\n[7]{} L.
