  "statement": "[**Theorem**]{} Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, and suppose\n$f:X\\to Y$ is a continuous function. For a subset $A\\subset X$, the of\n$f$ to $A$ (that is $f|_A$) is a continuous mapping $f|_A:A\\to Y$, where\n$A$ is given the subspace topology from $X$.\n\n*Proof.* We need to show that for any open set $V\\subset Y$, we can\nwrite $(f|_A)^{-1}(V) = A\\cap U$ for some set $U$ that is open in $X$.\nHowever, by the properties of the inverse image (see ), we have for any\nopen set $V\\subset Y$, $$(f|_A)^{-1}(V) = A\\cap f^{-1}(V).$$ Since\n$f:X\\to Y$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$, and our claim\nfollows. $\\Box$",
