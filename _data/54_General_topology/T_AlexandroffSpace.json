  "definition": "Topological space $X$ is called *Alexandroff* if the intersection of\nevery family of open sets is open.\n\nOf course every finite topological space is Alexandroff, but there are\nalso bigger Alexandroff spaces. For example let $\\mathbb{R}$ denote the\nset of real numbers and let\n$\\tau=\\{[a,\\infty)\\ |\\ a\\in\\mathbb{R}\\} \\cup \\{(b,\\infty)\\ |\\ b\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$.\nThen $\\tau$ is a topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $(\\mathbb{R},\\tau)$ is an\nAlexandroff space.\n\nIf $X$ is an Alexandroff space and $A\\subseteq X$, then we may talk\nabout smallest open neighbourhood of $A$. Indeed, let\n$$A^{o}=\\bigcap \\{U\\subseteq X\\ |\\ U\\mbox{ is open and }A\\mbox{ is contained in }U\\}.$$\nThen $A^{o}$ is open.",
