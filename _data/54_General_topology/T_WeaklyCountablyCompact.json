  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is said to be *weakly countably compact* (or\n*limit point compact*) if every infinite subset of $X$ has a limit\npoint.\n\nEvery countably compact space is weakly countably compact. The converse\nis true in .\n\nA metric space is weakly countably compact if and only if it is compact.\n\nAn easy example of a space $X$ that is not weakly countably compact is\nany infinite set with the discrete topology. A more interesting example\nis the countable complement topology on an uncountable set.",
