  "definition": "Suppose $X$ is a completely regular topological space. Then $X$ is said\nto be a *P-space* if every prime ideal in $C(X)$, the ring of continuous\nfunctions on $X$, is maximal.\n\nFor example, every space with the discrete topology is a P-space.\n\nAlgebraically, a commutative reduced ring $R$ with $1$ such that every\nprime ideal is maximal is equivalent to any of the following statements:\n\n-   $R$ is von-Neumann regular,\n\n-   every ideal in $R$ is the intersection of prime ideals,\n\n-   every ideal in $R$ is the intersection of maximal ideals,\n\n-   every principal ideal is generated by an idempotent.\n\nWhen $R=C(X)$, then $R$ is commutative reduced with $1$. In addition to\nthe algebraic characterizations of $R$ above, $X$ being a P-space is\nequivalent to any of the following statements:\n\n-   every zero set is open\n\n-   if $f,g\\in C(X)$, then $(f,g)=(f^2+g^2)$.\n\nSome properties of P-spaces:\n\n1.  Every subspace of a P-space is a P-space,\n\n2.  Every quotient space of a P-space is a P-space,\n\n3.  Every finite product of P-spaces is a P-space,\n\n4.  Every P-space has a base of clopen sets.\n\nFor more properties of P-spaces, please see the reference below. For\nproofs of the above properties and equivalent characterizations, see .\n\n[7]{} L.
