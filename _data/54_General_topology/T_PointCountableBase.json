  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space. A basis ${\\mathcal}{B}$ of $X$ is a\n*point countable base* if every point of $X$ is contained in at most\ncountably many sets of ${\\mathcal}{B}$.\n\nAny uniform base is a point countable base, and a theorem of R. W. Heath\nstates that every semimetric space with a point countable base is\ndevelopable.\n\n[9]{} Steen, Lynn Arthur and Seebach, J. Arthur, *Counterexamples in\nTopology*, Dover Books, 1995.",
