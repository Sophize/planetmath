  "definition": "A metric space $X$ is said to be a *real tree* or *${\\mathbb}{R}$-tree*,\nif for each $x,y\\in X$ there is a unique arc from $x$ to $y$, and\nfurthermore this arc is an isometric .\n\nEvery real tree is a hyperbolic metric space; moreover, every real tree\nis 0 hyperbolic.\n\nThe Cayley graph of any free group is considered to be a real tree. Note\nthat its graph is a tree in the graph theoretic sense. To make it a real\ntree, we view the edges as to the line segment $[0,1]$ under a\n(surjective) and attach the edges to the tree. The resulting 1-complex\nis then a locally finite real tree. Because of this result, every free\ngroup is a hyperbolic group.",
