  "definition": "Let $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A subset $\\mathcal{B}$ of\n$\\mathcal{T}$ is a *basis* for $\\mathcal{T}$ if every member of\n$\\mathcal{T}$ is a union of members of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nEquivalently, $\\mathcal{B}$ is a basis if and only if whenever $U$ is\nopen and $x\\in U$ then there is an open set $V \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such\nthat $x\\in V\\subseteq U$.\n\nThe topology generated by a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ consists of exactly the\nunions of the elements of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nWe also have the following easy characterization: (for a proof, see the\nattachment)\n\nA collection of subsets $\\mathcal{B}$ of $X$ is a basis for some\ntopology on $X$ if and only if each $x \\in X$ is in some element\n$B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and whenever $B_1, B_2\\in\\mathcal{B}$ and\n$x\\in B_1\\cap B_2$ then there is $B_3\\in\\mathcal{B}$ such that\n$x\\in B_3\\subseteq B_1\\cap B_2$.\n\n### Examples\n\n1\\. A basis for the usual topology of the real line is given by the set\nof open intervals since every open set can be expressed as a union of\nopen intervals. One may choose a smaller set as a basis. For instance,\nthe set of all open intervals with rational endpoints and the set of all\nintervals whose length is a power of $1/2$ are also bases. However, the\nset of all open intervals of length $1$ is not a basis although it is a\nsubbasis (since any interval of length less than $1$ can be expressed as\nan intersection of two intervals of length $1$).\n\n2\\. More generally, the set of open balls forms a basis for the topology\non a metric space.\n\n3\\. The set of all subsets with one element forms a basis for the\ndiscrete topology on any set.",
