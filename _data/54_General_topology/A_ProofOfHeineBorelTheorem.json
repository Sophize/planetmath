  "argumentText": "To shorten the proofs, we will be using certain concepts and facts from\ngeneral point-set topology, such as the very first assertion below. Even\nif you are not familiar with them, these assertions are all easily\nproven from the definitions (left as an exercise).\n\nSince ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is a Hausdorff space, any compact subset $A$ has\nto be closed as well. That $A$ is also bounded is very easily seen by\ntaking the open cover $\\{ (-k, k)^n \\}_{k \\in {\\mathbb{N}}}$. Passing to\na finite cover, we see that $A$ is contained in a bounded set.\n\nTo prove that if $A$ is closed and bounded implies it is compact, it is\nonly necessary to prove that the rectangle $[a,b]^n$ is compact. For\ngeneral $A$, since $A$ is bounded, it is contained in some such compact\nrectangle $[a, b]^n$. Since $A$ is closed and contained in a compact\nset, $A$ is also compact.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}$ be an arbitrary cover of $[a, b]$ by open sets in\n${\\mathbb{R}}^1$. Define\n$$S = \\{ x \\in [a,b] : \\textrm{some finite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ covers $[a, x]$} \\}\\,.$$\nSet $t = \\sup S$; then $a \\leq t \\leq b < \\infty$.\n\nWe first note that the supremum $t$ is attained: that is, there is a\nfinite subcollection of $\\mathcal{C}$ that covers $[a,t]$. Obviously we\ncan choose one open set $U$ from $\\mathcal{C}$ that covers the point\n$t$. This $U$ must also cover the open interval\n$(t-\\epsilon, t+\\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. But by the\ndefinition of $t$, the interval $[a, t-\\epsilon]$ has a finite subcover.\nWhen this finite subcover is put together with $U$, we obtain a finite\nsubcover for $[a, t]$.\n\nIt is easy to see that $t$ cannot be less than $b$. For the same open\nset $U$ above covers the interval $(t, t+\\epsilon)$, so we have a finite\nsubcover for $[a, t+\\epsilon/2]$. If $t$ is the supremum then it has go\nto be at the right endpoint of the interval $[a, b]$, i.e. $t = b$.\n\nFor the case $n > 1$, apply , which states:\n\n> If $X_1, \\dotsc, X_n$ are each compact, then\n> $X_1 \\times \\dotsm \\times X_n$ in the product topology is compact.\n\nHere we set $X_i$ to be the closed intervals; then the general closed\nrectangle in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is compact. It is not hard to see that the\nproduct topology for the closed rectangle is the same as its subspace\ntopology in the product topology\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n = {\\mathbb{R}}\\times \\dotsm \\times {\\mathbb{R}}$. And it\nis again a standard exercise to show that the product topology on\n${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ is the same as the norm topology on ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$ as\na vector space.\n\nThis completes the proof of the Heine-Borel theorem.\n\nProof by a bisection argument {#proof-by-a-bisection-argument .unnumbered}\n=============================\n\nThere is another proof of the Heine-Borel theorem for ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$\nwithout resorting to Tychonoff\u2019s Theorem. It goes by bisecting the\nrectangle along each of its sides. At the first stage, we divide up the\nrectangle $A$ into $2^n$ subrectangles. Suppose the open cover\n$\\mathcal{C}$ of $A$ has no finite subcover. Then one of the\nsubrectangles \u2014 call it $A_1$ \u2014 must have no finite subcover by\n$\\mathcal{C}$. We can subdivide $A_1$ into $2^n$ pieces; since $A_1$ has\nno finite subcover, one of the new subrectangles of $A_1$ also has no\nfinite subcover. And continue dividing to get a nested sequence of\nrectangles $A \\supset A_1 \\supset A_2 \\supset \\dotsb$ whose side lengths\napproach zero, and possessing no finite subcover.\n\nBy the nested interval theorem, the \u201climit rectangle\u201d\n$\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty A_i$ must consist of a sole point $x$, and this\nobviously has a finite subcover by an open set $U \\in \\mathcal{C}$. But\n$U$ must contain a small rectangle with centre $x$, which for $i$ large\nenough, contradicts $A_i$ having no finite subcover.\n\nOf course, in both proofs of the Heine-Borel theorem, the completeness\nof the reals (the least upper bound property) enters in an essential\nway.",
