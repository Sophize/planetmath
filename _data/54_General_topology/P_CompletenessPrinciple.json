  "statement": "The *completeness principle* is a property of the real numbers, and is\none of the foundations of real analysis. The most common formulation of\nthis principle is that every non-empty set which is bounded from above\nhas a supremum.\n\nThis statement can be reformulated in several ways. Each of the\nfollowing statements is to the above definition of the completeness\nprinciple:\n\n1.  The limit of every infinite decimal sequence is a real number.\n\n2.  Every bounded monotonic sequence is convergent.\n\n3.  A sequence is convergent iff it is a Cauchy Sequence.",
