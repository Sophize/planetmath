  "statement": "The union of a collection of closed subsets of a topological space need\nnot, of course, be closed. However, we do have the following result:\n\nThe union of a locally finite collection of closed subsets of a\ntopological space is itself closed.\n\nLet $\\cal S$ be a locally finite collection of closed subsets of a\ntopological space $X$, and put $Y=\\cup\\cal S$. Let $x\\in X\\setminus Y$.\nBy local finiteness there is an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ that meets\nonly finitely many members of $\\cal S$, say $A_1,\\dots,A_n$. So\n$U\\setminus Y=U\\setminus\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$, which is open. Thus\n$U\\setminus Y$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ that does not meet $Y$.\nIt follows that $Y$ is closed.\n\nOne use for this result can be found in the entry on gluing together\ncontinuous functions.",
