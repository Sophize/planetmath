  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is said to be *hyperconnected* if no pair of\nnonempty open sets of $X$ is disjoint (or, equivalently, if $X$ is not\nthe union of two proper closed sets). Hyperconnected spaces are\nsometimes known as .\n\nAll hyperconnected spaces are connected, locally connected, and\npseudocompact.\n\nAny infinite set with the cofinite topology is an example of a\nhyperconnected space. Similarly, any uncountable set with the\ncocountable topology is hyperconnected. Affine spaces and projectives\nspaces over an infinite field, when endowed with the Zariski topology,\nare also hyperconnected.",
