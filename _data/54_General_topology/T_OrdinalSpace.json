  "definition": "Let $\\alpha$ be an ordinal. The set\n$W(\\alpha):=\\lbrace \\beta \\mid \\beta < \\alpha\\rbrace$ ordered by $\\le$\nis a well-ordered set. $W(\\alpha)$ becomes a topological space if we\nequip $W(\\alpha)$ with the interval topology. An *ordinal space* $X$ is\na topological space such that $X=W(\\alpha)$ (with the interval topology)\nfor some ordinal $\\alpha$. In this entry, we will always assume that\n$W(\\alpha)\\ne \\varnothing$, or $0<\\alpha$.\n\nBefore examining some basic topological structures of $W(\\alpha)$, let\nus look at some of its order structures.\n\n1.  First, it is easy to see that $W(\\alpha)={\\uparrow\\!\\!}y \\cup W(y)$,\n    for any $y\\in W(\\alpha)$. Here, ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}y$ is the upper set\n    of $y$.\n\n2.  Another way of saying that $W(\\alpha)$ is well-ordered is that for\n    any non-empyt subset $S$ of $W(\\alpha)$, $\\bigwedge S$ exists.\n    Clearly, $0\\in W(\\alpha)$ is its least element. If in addition\n    $1<\\alpha$, $W(\\alpha)$ is also atomic, with $1$ as the sole atom.\n\n3.  Next, $W(\\alpha)$ is bounded complete. If $S\\subseteq W(\\alpha)$ is\n    bounded from above by $a\\in W(\\alpha)$, then $b=\\bigvee S$ is an\n    ordinal such that $b\\le a<\\alpha$, therefore $b\\in W(\\alpha)$ as\n    well.\n\n4.  Finally, we note that $W(\\alpha)$ is a complete lattice iff $\\alpha$\n    is not a limit ordinal. If $W(\\alpha)$ is complete, then\n    $z=\\bigvee W(\\alpha)\\in W(\\alpha)$. So $z<\\alpha$. This means that\n    $z+1\\le \\alpha$. If $z+1<\\alpha$, then $z+1\\in W(\\alpha)$ so that\n    $z+1\\le \\bigvee W(\\alpha)=z$, a contradiction. As a result,\n    $z+1=\\alpha$. On the other hand, if $\\alpha=z+1$, then\n    $z=\\bigvee W(\\alpha)\\in W(\\alpha)$, so that $W(\\alpha)$ is complete.\n\nIn any ordinal space $W(\\alpha)$ where $0<\\alpha$, a typical open\ninterval may be written $(x,y)$, where $0\\le x\\le y<\\alpha$. If $y$ is\nnot a limit ordinal, we can also write $(x,y)=[x+1,z]$ where $z+1=y$.\nThis means that $(x,y)$ is a clopen set if $y$ is not a limit ordinal.\nIn particular, if $y$ is not a limit ordinal, then\n$\\lbrace y\\rbrace = (z,y+1)$ is clopen, where $z+1=y$, so that $y$ is an\nisolated point. For example, any finite ordinal is an isolated point in\n$W(\\alpha)$.\n\nConversely, an isolated point can not be a limit ordinal. If $y$ is\nisolated, then $\\lbrace y\\rbrace$ is open. Write $\\lbrace y\\rbrace$ as\nthe union of open intervals $(a_i,b_i)$. So $a_i<y<b_i$. Since $y+1$\ncovers $y$, each $b_i$ must be $y+1$ or $(a_i,b_i)$ would contain more\nthan a point. If $y$ is a limit ordinal, then $a_i<a_i+1<y$ so that,\nagain, $(a_i,b_i)$ would contain more than just $y$. Therefore, $y$ can\nnot be a limit ordinal and all $a_i$ must be the same. Therefore\n$(a_i,b_i)=(z,y+1)$, where $z$ is the predecessor of $y$: $z+1=y$.\n\nSeveral basic properties of an ordinal space are:\n\n1.  Isolated points in $W(\\alpha)$ are exactly those points that are\n    limit ordinals (just a summary of the last two paragraphs).\n\n2.  $W(y)$ is open in $W(\\alpha)$ for any $y\\in W(\\alpha)$. $W(y)$ is\n    closed iff $y$ is not a limit ordinal.\n\n3.  For any $y\\in W(\\alpha)$, the collection of intervals of the form\n    $(a,y]$ (where $a<y$) forms a neighborhood base of $y$.\n\n4.  $W(\\alpha)$ is a normal space for any $\\alpha$;\n\n5.  $W(\\alpha)$ is compact iff $\\alpha$ is not a limit ordinal.\n\nSome interesting ordinal spaces are\n\n-   $W(\\omega)$, which is homeomorphic to the set of natural numbers\n    $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\n-   $W(\\omega_1)$, where $\\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal.\n    $W(\\omega_1)$ is often written $\\Omega_0$. $\\Omega_0$ is not a\n    compact space.\n\n-   $W(\\omega_1+1)$, or $\\Omega$. $\\Omega$ is compact, and, in fact, a\n    one-point compactification of $\\Omega_0$.\n\n[9]{} S.
