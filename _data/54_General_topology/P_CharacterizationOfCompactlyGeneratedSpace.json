  "statement": "We give equivalent conditions when a Hausdorff topological space is\ncompactly generated. First we need a definition.\n\n**Definition.** Let $X$ be a $T_1$ space and $Y$ a topological space. We\ndefine $C_k(X, Y)$ to be the set of functions $f \\colon X \\to Y$ such\nthat for every compact, closed set $K \\subset X$ the restriction\n$f_{|K}$ is continuous.\n\nClearly, $C(X, Y) \\subset C_k(X, Y)$ for such spaces $X, Y$. With this\nwe have the following theorem.\n\n**Theorem.** Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Then the following conditions\nare equivalent.\n\n*i)* $X$ is compactly generated\n\n*ii)* $X$ carries the final topology generated by the family of\ninclusion mappings\n$(i_K \\colon K \\to X)_{K \\subset X \\ \\text{compact}}$.\n\n*iii)* For every topological space $Y$ we have $C_k(X, Y) = C(X, Y)$.\n\n*iv)* $X$ is an image of a locally compact space under a quotient\nmapping.\n\n**Remark.** It follows easily from this that if there is a quotient\nmapping $f \\colon X \\to Y$ which maps a compactly generated space $X$\nonto a Hausdorff space $Y$ then $Y$ is compactly generated.",
