  "definition": "A topological space is a *regular space* if it is both a and a .\n\n[**Example.**]{} Consider the set ${\\mathbbmss{R}}$ with the topology\n$\\sigma$ generated by the basis\n$$\\beta=\\{ U=V-C: V \\mbox{ is open with the standard topology and\\ } C \\mbox{ is (infinite) numerable}\\}.$$\n\nSince ${\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ is numerable and ${\\mathbbmss{R}}$ open, the set\nof irrational numbers ${\\mathbbmss{R}}-{\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ is open and\ntherefore ${\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ is closed. It can be shown that\n${\\mathbbmss{R}}-{\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ is an open set with this topology and\n${\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ is closed.\n\nTake any irrational number $x$. Any open set $V$ containing all\n${\\mathbbmss{Q}}$ must contain also $x$, so the regular space property\ncannot be satisfied. Therefore, $({\\mathbbmss{R}},\\sigma)$ is not a\nregular space.\n\n### Note {#note .unnumbered}\n\nIn topology, the terminology for separation axioms is not standard.\nTherefore there are also other meanings of regular. In some references\n(e.g. [@kelley]) the meanings of regular and $T_3$ is exchanged. That\nis, $T_3$ is a stronger property than regular.\n\n[9]{} L.A.
