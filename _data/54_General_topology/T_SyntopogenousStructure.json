  "definition": "In the early part of the 20th century, topological spaces were invented\nto capture the essence of the idea of continuity. At around the same\ntime, other competing ideas had emerged, resulting in a variety of other\n\u201csimilar\u201d types of spaces: uniform spaces and proximity spaces are the\ntwo prominent examples. These abstractions have led mathematicians to\neven further abstractions, in an attempt to combine all these concepts\ninto a single construct. One such result is so-called a *syntopogenous\nstructure*.\n\nBefore formally defining what a syntopogenous structure is, let us look\nat some of the commonalities among the three types of spaces that led to\nthis \u201cgeneralized\u201d structure. Specifically, in all three types of\nsapces, we can define a transitive relation on the space such that the\nrelation satisfies some features that are common in all three cases:\n\nLet $X$ be a space and $A,B\\subseteq X$, we define $A\\le B$ iff\n\n-   (topological) $A\\subseteq B^{\\circ}$, the interior of $B$.\n\n-   (uniform) $U[A]\\subseteq B$ for some entourage $U$. $U[A]$ is a\n    uniform neighborhood of $A$.\n\n-   (proximity) $A\\delta' (X-B)$, where $\\delta$ is the proximity\n    relation, and $\\delta'$ is its complement.\n\nIn all three cases, the relation is transitive. Furthermore, we have the\nfollowing:\n\n1.  $\\varnothing\\le \\varnothing$,\n\n2.  $X\\le X$,\n\n3.  if $A\\le B$, then $A\\subseteq B$,\n\n4.  if $A\\le B$ and $C\\le D$, then $A\\cap C\\le B\\cap D$,\n\n5.  if $A\\le B$ and $C\\le D$, then $A\\cup C\\le B\\cup D$,\n\n6.  if $A\\subseteq B\\le C\\subseteq D$, then $A\\le D$.\n\n**Definition**. Let $X$ be a set. A *topogenous order* $\\le$ on $X$ is a\nbinary relation on $P(X)$, the powerset of $X$, satisfying the six\nproperties above.\n\nBy properties 2 and 6, we see that a topogenous order is a transitive\nantisymmetric relation.\n\nWe are now ready for the main definition.\n\n**Definition**. A *syntopogenous structure* consists of a set $X$ and a\ncollection $\\mathscr{S}$ of topogenous orders on $X$ such that:\n\n-   if $R_1,R_2\\in \\mathscr{S}$, then there is $R\\in \\mathscr{S}$ such\n    that $R_1 \\cap R_2 \\subseteq R$,\n\n-   for any $R \\in \\mathscr{S}$, then there is $S\\in \\mathscr{S}$ such\n    that $R \\subseteq S\\circ S$.\n\n**Remark**. The two defining conditions of a syntopogenous structure\n$(X,\\mathscr{S})$ are equivalent to the following, given subsets $A,B$\nof $X$:\n\n-   for any $\\le_1,\\le_2\\in \\mathscr{S}$, there is a\n    $\\le\\in \\mathscr{S}$ such that $A\\le_1 B$ and $A\\le_2 B$ imply\n    $A\\le B$,\n\n-   for any $\\le_1\\in \\mathscr{S}$ with $A\\le_1 B$, there is a\n    $\\le_2\\in\\mathscr{S}$ such that $A\\le_2 C\\le_2 B$ for some subset\n    $C$ of $X$.\n\n[9]{} A.
