  "definition": "The [**y-homeomorphism**]{} also dubbed [**crosscap slide**]{}, is an\nauto-homeomorphism (or self-homeomorphism) which can be defined only for\n[**non orientable surfaces**]{} whose genus is greater than one.\n\nTo define it we take a punctured Klein bottle\n$K_0=K\\setminus{\\rm int}\\ D^2$ which can be consider as a pair of closed\nM\u00f6bius bands $M_1,M_2$, one sewed in the other by perforating with a\ndisk (being disjoint from $\\partial M_1$) and then identify the boundary\nof the second with the boundary of that disk, in symbols:\n$$K_0=(M_1\\setminus{\\rm int}\\ D^2)\\cup_{\\partial}M_2$$ where\n$\\partial =\\partial D^2=\\partial M_2$. Other way to visualizing that, is\nby consider $K_0$ as the connected sum of ${\\rm int}\\ M_1$ with a\nprojective plane ${\\mathbb{R}}P^2$.\n\nNow, thinking that the removed disk $D^2$ was located with its center at\nsome point in the core of $M_1$, the second band, $M_2$ will have a pair\nof points on that part of the core in common with $\\partial M_2$.\n\nSo, the y-homeomorphism is defined by a isotopy leaving the boundary\n$\\partial M_1$ fixed by sliding the second band $M_2$ one turn around\nthe core of $M_1$ till the original position. The result is an\nautomorphism of $K_0$ which maps $M_2$ into itself but reversing it.\n\nTo define this for genus greater than two just consider any other non\norientable surface as a connected sum of a Kein bottle plus projective\nplanes.\n\n1.
