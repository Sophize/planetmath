  "statement": "Let $X$ be a normed vector space, and let $K\\subset X$ be a non-empty,\ncompact, and convex set. Then given any continuous mapping\n$f\\colon K \\to K$ there exists $x\\in K$ such that $f(x)=x$.\n\nNotice that the unit disc of a finite dimensional vector space is always\nconvex and compact hence this theorem extends Brouwer Fixed Point\nTheorem.\n\nNotice that the space $X$ is not required to be complete, however the\nsubset $K$ being compact, is complete with respect to the metric induced\nby $X$.\n\n[9]{} Rudin, *Functional Analysis*, Chapter 5.",
