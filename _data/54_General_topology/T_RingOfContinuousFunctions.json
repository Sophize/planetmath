  "definition": "Let $X$ be a topological space and $C(X)$ be the function space\nconsisting of all continuous functions from $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}$, the\nreals (with the usual metric topology).\n\n### Ring Structure on $C(X)$ {#ring-structure-on-cx .unnumbered}\n\nTo formally define $C(X)$ as a ring, we take a step backward, and look\nat $\\mathbb{R}^X$, the set of all functions from $X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. We\nwill define a ring structure on $\\mathbb{R}^X$ so that $C(X)$ inherits\nthat structure and forms a ring itself.\n\nFor any $f,g\\in \\mathbb{R}^X$ and any $r\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we define the\nfollowing operations:\n\n1.  (addition) $(f+g)(x):=f(x)+g(x)$,\n\n2.  (multiplication) $(fg)(x):=f(x)g(x)$,\n\n3.  (identities) Define $r(x):=r$ for all $x\\in X$. These are the\n    constant functions. The special constant functions $1(x)$ and $0(x)$\n    are the *multiplicative* and *additive identities* in\n    $\\mathbb{R}^X$.\n\n4.  (additive inverse) $(-f)(x):=-(f(x))$,\n\n5.  (multiplicative inverse) if $f(x)\\ne 0$ for all $x\\in X$, then we\n    may define the multiplicative inverse of $f$, written $f^{-1}$ by\n    $$f^{-1}(x):=\\frac{1}{f(x)}.$$ This is not to be confused with the\n    functional inverse of $f$.\n\nAll the ring axioms are easily verified. So $\\mathbb{R}^X$ is a ring,\nand actually a commutative ring. It is immediate that any constant\nfunction other than the additive identity is invertible.\n\nSince $C(X)$ is closed under all of the above operations, and that\n$0,1\\in C(X)$, $C(X)$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{R}^X$, and is called *the\nring of continuous functions* over $X$.\n\n### Additional Structures on $C(X)$ {#additional-structures-on-cx .unnumbered}\n\n$\\mathbb{R}^X$ becomes an $\\mathbb{R}$-algebra if we define scalar\nmultiplication by $(rf)(x):=r(f(x))$. As a result, $C(X)$ is a\nsubalgebra of $\\mathbb{R}^X$.\n\nIn addition to having a ring structure, $\\mathbb{R}^X$ also has a\nnatural order structure, with the partial order defined by $f\\le g$ iff\n$f(x)\\le g(x)$ for all $x\\in X$. The positive cone is the set\n$\\lbrace f\\mid 0\\le f\\rbrace$. The absolute value, given by\n$|f|(x):=|f(x)|$, is an operator mapping $\\mathbb{R}^X$ onto its\npositive cone. With the absolute value operator defined, we can put a on\n$\\mathbb{R}^X$ as well:\n\n-   (meet) $f\\vee g:=2^{-1}(f+g+|f-g|)$. Here, $2^{-1}$ is the constant\n    function valued at $\\frac{1}{2}$ (also as the multiplicative inverse\n    of the constant function $2$).\n\n-   (join) $f\\wedge g:=f+g-(f\\vee g)$.\n\nSince taking the absolute value of a continuous function is again\ncontinuous, $C(X)$ is a sublattice of $\\mathbb{R}^X$. As a result, we\nmay consider $C(X)$ as a lattice-ordered ring of continuous functions.\n\n**Remarks**. Any subring of $C(X)$ is called a *ring of continuous\nfunctions* over $X$. This subring may or may not be a sublattice of\n$C(X)$. Other than $C(X)$, the two commonly used lattice-ordered\nsubrings of $C(X)$ are\n\n-   $C^*(X)$, the subset of $C(X)$ consisting of all bounded continuous\n    functions. It is easy to see that $C^*(X)$ is closed under all of\n    the algebraic operations (ring-theoretic or lattice-theoretic). So\n    $C^*(X)$ is a lattice-ordered subring of $C(X)$. When $X$ is\n    pseudocompact, and in particular, when $X$ is compact,\n    $C^*(X)=C(X)$.\n\n    In this subring, there is a natural norm that can be defined:\n    $$\\|f\\|:= \\sup_{x \\in X} |f(x)|=\\inf \\lbrace r\\in\\mathbb{R} \\mid |f|\\le r\\rbrace.$$\n    Routine verifications show that $\\|fg\\|\\le \\|f\\|\\|g\\|$, so that\n    $C^*(X)$ becomes a normed ring.\n\n-   The subset of $C^*(X)$ consisting of all constant functions. This is\n    isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, and is often identified as such, so that\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ is considered as a lattice-ordered subring of $C(X)$.\n\n[7]{} L. Gillman, M.
