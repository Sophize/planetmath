  "argumentText": "Proof of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem: I\u2019m going to prove a stronger\nstatement than the one given in the statement of the Borsak-Ulam theorem\nhere, which is:\n\n[*Every odd (that is, antipode-preserving) map $f:S^n\\to S^n$ has odd\ndegree.*]{}\n\nProof: We go by induction on $n$. Consider the pair $(S^n,A)$ where $A$\nis the equatorial sphere. $f$ defines a map\n$$\\tilde{f}:\\mathbb{R}P^n\\to\\mathbb{R}P^n$$. By cellular approximation,\nthis may be assumed to take the hyperplane at infinity (the $n-1$-cell\nof the standard cell structure on $\\mathbb{R}P^n$) to itself. Since\nwhether a map lifts to a covering depends only on its homotopy class,\n$f$ is homotopic to an odd map taking $A$ to itself. We may assume that\n$f$ is such a map.\n\nThe map $f$ gives us a morphism of the long exact sequences:\n$$\\begin{CD}\nH_n(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>i>> H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>j>> H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>\\partial>> H_{n-1}(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\n@>i>> H_{n-1}(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\\\\n@Vf^*VV @Vf^*VV @Vf^*VV @Vf^*VV @Vf^*VV \\\\\nH_n(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>i>> H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>j>> H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})@>\\partial>> H_{n-1}(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\n@>i>> H_{n-1}(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\\\\n\\end{CD}$$\n\nClearly, the map $f|_A$ is odd, so by the induction hypothesis, $f|_A$\nhas odd degree. Note that a map has odd degree if and only if\n$f^*:H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\to H_n(S^n,{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$ is an\nisomorphism. Thus\n$$f^*:H_{n-1}(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\to H_{n-1}(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$$ is an\nisomorphism. By the commutativity of the diagram, the map\n$$f^*:H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\to H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$$ is\nnot trivial. I claim it is an isomorphism. $H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$\nis generated by cycles $[R^+]$ and $[R^-]$ which are the fundamental\nclasses of the upper and lower hemispheres, and the antipodal map\nexchanges these. Both of these map to the fundamental class of $A$,\n$[A]\\in H_{n-1}(A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$. By the commutativity of the\ndiagram, $\\partial(f^*([R^\\pm]))=f^*(\\partial([R^\\pm]))=f^*([A])=[A]$.\nThus $f^*([R^+])=[R^\\pm]$ and $f^*([R^-])\n=[R^\\mp]$ since $f$ commutes with the antipodal map. Thus $f^*$ is an\nisomorphism on $H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$. Since\n$H_n(A,{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})=0$, by the exactness of the sequence\n$i:H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\n\\to H_n(S^n,A;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$ is injective, and so by the\ncommutativity of the diagram (or equivalently by the $5$-lemma)\n$f^*:H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})\\to H_n(S^n;{{\\mathbb{Z}}_2})$ is an\nisomorphism. Thus $f$ has odd degree.\n\nThe other statement of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is:\n\n[*There is no odd map $S^n\\to S^{n-1}$.*]{}\n\nProof: If $f$ where such a map, consider $f$ restricted to the equator\n$A$ of $S^n$. This is an odd map from $S^{n-1}$ to $S^{n-1}$ and thus\nhas odd degree. But the map $$f^*H_{n-1}(A)\\to H_{n-1}(S^{n-1})$$\nfactors through $H_{n-1}(S^n)=0$, and so must be zero. Thus $f|_A$ has\ndegree 0, a contradiction.",
