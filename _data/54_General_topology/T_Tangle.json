  "definition": "A tangle is a $1$-manifold, i.e. a disjoint union of arcs and circles,\nembedded in $(0,1)^{2}\\times[0,1]$. The boundary of a tangle is\ncontained in $(0,1)^{2}\\times\\{0,1\\}$. Two tangles are considered\nequivalent if and only if they are ambient isotopic relative to their\nboundaries. Combinatorially, tangles can be understood as tangle\ndiagrams. Any two tangle diagrams which represent the same tangle can be\nconnected by Reidemeister moves. This is the content of a slight\ngeneralization of Reidemeister\u2019s theorem. Algebraically, tangles form\nthe morphisms of a tortile monoidal category. This is a corollary of\nShum\u2019s theorem. Specifically, they form the tortile monoidal category\ngenerated by a self-dual,unframed object.",
