  "definition": "A topological space is said to be *second* if it has a countable . It\ncan be shown that a space is both Lindel\u00f6f and separable, although the\nconverses fail. For instance, the lower limit topology on the real line\nis both Lindel\u00f6f and separable, but not second countable.",
