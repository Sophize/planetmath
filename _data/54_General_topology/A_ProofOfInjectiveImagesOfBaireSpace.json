  "argumentText": "We show that, for an uncountable Polish space $X$, there exists a\ncontinuous and one-to-one function $f\\colon\\mathcal{N}\\rightarrow X$\nsuch that $X\\setminus f(\\mathcal{N})$ is countable. Furthermore, the\ninverse of $f$ defined on $f(\\mathcal{N})$ is Borel measurable.\n\nThe construction of the function relies on the following result. We let\n$d$ be a complete metric on $X$ with respect to which the diameter of\nany subset is defined.\n\nLet $S$ be an uncountable subset of $X$ which can be written as the\ndifference of two closed sets, and choose any $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nThen, there exists a sequence $S_1,S_2,\\ldots$ of pairwise disjoint and\nuncountable subsets of $S$ with diameter no more than $\\epsilon$ and\nsuch that,\n\n1.  for each $n>0$, $\\bigcup_{k\\le n}S_k$ is closed.\n\n2.  $S\\setminus\\bigcup_nS_n$ is countable.\n\nAs $S=A\\setminus B$ is the difference of closed sets, it is a Polish\nspace under the subspace topology. In fact, if $B$ is nonempty, the\ntopology is generated by the complete metric\n$$d_S(x,y)=d(x,y)+\\sup\\left\\{|d(x,z)^{-1}-d(y,z)^{-1}|\\colon z\\in B\\right\\},$$\notherwise we may take $d_S=d$. In either case, $d_S\\ge d$, so it is\nenough to choose the sets $S_n$ to have diameter no more than $2^{-n}$\nwith respect to $d_S$. Note also that any bounded and closed set with\nrespect to this metric is also closed as a subset of $X$.\n\nLet $S^c$ be the condensation points of $S$, which are the points whose\nneighborhoods all contain uncountably many points of $S$. Then,\n$S\\setminus S^c$ is a union of countably many countable and open subsets\nof $S$, so is countable and open. Hence, $S^c$ is uncountable and closed\nin $S$, and every open subset is uncountable. Choosing any $p\\in S^c$\nthen $S^c\\setminus p$ will not be a closed subset of $X$. So, replacing\n$S$ by $S\\setminus\\{p\\}$ if necessary, we may suppose that $S^c$ is not\nclosed as a subset of $X$ and, therefore is not compact.\n\nSo, for some $\\delta>0$, $S^c$ cannot be covered by finitely many sets\nwith $d_S$-diameter no more than $\\delta$ (see ). By separability, there\nis a sequence $T_1,T_2,\\ldots$ of open balls in $S^c$ with diameter less\nthan $\\min(\\epsilon,\\delta)$, and covering $S^c$. Writing $\\bar T_n$ for\nthe $d_S$-closure of $T_n$ and eliminating any terms such that\n$T_n\\subseteq\\bigcup_{k<n}\\bar T_k$, then\n$S_n\\equiv\\bar T_n\\setminus \\bigcup_{k< n}\\bar T_k$ have nonempty\ninterior and hence are uncountable, and\n$$S\\setminus\\bigcup_nS_n=S\\setminus S^c$$ is countable, as required.\n\nNote that $S_n=\\bigcup_{k\\le n}S_k\\setminus\\bigcup_{k\\le n-1}S_k$ is\nalso a difference of closed sets. So, the lemma allows us to inductively\nchoose sets $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\subseteq X$ for integers $k\\ge 0$ and\n$n_1,\\ldots,n_k\\ge 1$ such that $C()=X$ and the following are satisfied.\n\n1.  $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)$ are uncountable, contained in\n    $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$, and pairwise disjoint as $m$ runs through the\n    positive integers.\n\n2.  $\\bigcup_{j\\le m}C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,j)$ is closed for all $m\\ge 1$.\n\n3.  $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\setminus\\bigcup_mC(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)$ is\n    countable and, for $k\\ge 1$, has diameter no more than $2^{-k}$.\n\nFor any $n\\in\\mathcal{N}$ we may choose a sequence\n$x_k\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$. Since, for $k\\ge 1$, this set has diameter\nno more than $2^{-k}$, then $d(x_j,x_k)\\le 2^{-k}$ whenever\n$j\\ge k\\ge 1$. So, the sequence is and hence has a limit $x$.\nFurthermore, as $x_j$ is contained in the closed set\n$$\\bigcup_{m\\le n_{k+1}}C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)$$ for $j>k$, then $x$ must\nalso be contained in it and hence is in $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$. So\n$$C(n)\\equiv\\bigcap_{k=0}^\\infty C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$$ contains $x$ and is\nnonempty. Furthermore, as it has zero diameter, it is a singleton. So\n$f\\colon\\mathcal{N}\\rightarrow X$ is uniquely defined by $f(n)\\in C(n)$.\n\nGiven any $m,n\\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that $m_j=n_j$ for $j\\le k$, then\n$f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both in the set $C(m_1,\\ldots,m_k)$, which has\ndiameter no more than $2^{-k}$. So, $d(f(m),f(n))\\le 2^{-k}$ and $f$ is\ncontinuous.\n\nIf $m$ and $n$ are distinct elements of $\\mathcal{N}$ and $k$ is the\nsmallest integer such that $m_k\\not= n_k$, then $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are in\nthe disjoint sets $C(m_1,\\ldots,m_k)$ and $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$\nrespectively. So $f(m)\\not= f(n)$, and $f$ is one-to-one.\n\nNow let $A$ be the countable set\n$$A = \\bigcup_k\\bigcup_{n_1,\\ldots,n_k}\\left( C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\setminus\\bigcup_mC(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)\\right)\\subseteq X.$$\nAlso define\n$$\\mathcal{N}(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\equiv\\left\\{m\\in\\mathcal{N}\\colon m_j=n_j\\text{ for }j\\le k\\right\\}.$$\nThese sets form a basis for the topology on $\\mathcal{N}$. Clearly,\n$$f\\left(\\mathcal{N}(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\right)\\subseteq C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\setminus A.$$\nChoosing any $x\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\setminus A$ then we can inductively\nfind $n_j$ for $j>k$ such that $x\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_j)$. Then, setting\n$n=(n_1,n_2,\\ldots)$ gives $f(n)=x$. This shows that $$\\label{eq:1}\nf\\left(\\mathcal{N}(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\right)=C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\setminus A.$$\nIn particular, $f(\\mathcal{N})=X\\setminus A$ and, therefore\n$X\\setminus f(\\mathcal{N})$ is countable. Finally, as\n$C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ is a difference of closed sets, it is Borel, and\nequation (\\[eq:1\\]) shows that the inverse of $f$ is Borel measurable.",
