  "statement": "Let $G$ be a real Lie group. TFAE:\n\n1.  Every real representation of $G$ has an invariant positive definite\n    form, and $G$ has at least one faithful representation.\n\n2.  One faithful representation of $G$ has an invariant positive\n    definite form.\n\n3.  $G$ is compact.\n\nAlso, any group satisfying these criteria is reductive, and its Lie\nalgebra is the direct sum of simple algebras and an abelian algebra\n(such an algebra is often called reductive).\n\n$(1)\\Rightarrow (2)$: Obvious.\n\n$(2)\\Rightarrow (3)$: Let $\\Omega$ be the invariant form on a faithful\nrepresentation $V$. Let then representation gives an embedding\n$\\rho:G\\to \\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)$, the group of automorphisms of $V$\npreserving $\\Omega$. Thus, $G$ is homeomorphic to a closed subgroup of\n$\\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)$. Since this group is compact, $G$ must be\ncompact as well.\n\n(Proof that $\\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)$ is compact: By induction on\n$\\dim V$. Let $v\\in V$ be an arbitrary vector. Then there is a map,\nevaluation on $v$, from $\\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)\\to S^{\\dim V-1}\\subset V$\n(this is topologically a sphere, since $(V,\\omega)$ is isometric to\n${\\mathbb{R}}^{\\dim V}$ with the standard norm). This is a a fiber\nbundle, and the fiber over any point is a copy of\n$\\mathrm{SO}(v^{\\perp},\\Omega)$, which is compact by the inductive\nhypothesis. Any fiber bundle over a compact base with compact fiber has\ncompact total space. Thus $\\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)$ is compact).\n\n$(3)\\Rightarrow(1)$: Let $V$ be an arbitrary representation of $G$.\nChoose an arbitrary positive definite form $\\Omega$ on $V$. Then define\n$$\\tilde{\\Omega}(v,w)=\\int_{G}\\Omega(gv,gw)dg,$$ where $dg$ is Haar\nmeasure (normalized so that $\\int_Gdg=1$). Since $K$ is compact, this\ngives a well defined form. It is obviously bilinear,\nb$\\mathrm{SO}(V,\\Omega)$y the linearity of integration, and positive\ndefinite since $$\\tilde{\\Omega}(gv,gv)=\n\\int_G\\Omega(gv,gv)dg\\geq \\inf_{g\\in G}\\Omega(gv,gv)>0.$$ Furthermore,\n$\\tilde\\Omega$ is invariant, since\n$$\\tilde\\Omega(hv,hw)=\\int_G\\Omega(ghv,ghw)dg=\\int_G\\Omega(ghv,ghw)d(gh)=\n\\tilde\\Omega(v,w).$$\n\nFor representation $\\rho:T\\to \\mathrm{GL}(V)$ of the maximal torus\n$T\\subset K$, there exists a representation $\\rho'$ of $K$, with $\\rho$\na $T$-subrepresentation of $\\rho'$. Also, since every conjugacy class of\n$K$ intersects any maximal torus, a representation of $K$ is faithful if\nand only if it restricts to a faithful representation of $T$. Since any\ntorus has a faithful representation, $K$ must have one as well.\n\nGiven that these criteria hold, let $V$ be a representation of $G$,\n$\\Omega$ is positive definite real form, and $W$ a subrepresentation.\nNow consider $$W^{\\perp}=\\{v\\in V|\\Omega(v,w)=0 \\,\\forall w\\in W\\}.$$ By\nthe positive definiteness of $\\Omega$, $V=W\\oplus W^{\\perp}$. By\ninduction, $V$ is completely reducible.\n\nApplying this to the adjoint representation of $G$ on ${\\mathfrak{g}}$,\nits Lie algebra, we find that ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ in the direct sum of\nsimple algebras ${\\mathfrak{g}}_1,\\ldots,{\\mathfrak{g}}_n$, in the sense\nthat ${\\mathfrak{g}}_i$ has no proper nontrivial ideals, meaning that\n${\\mathfrak{g}}_i$ is simple in the usual sense or it is abelian.",
