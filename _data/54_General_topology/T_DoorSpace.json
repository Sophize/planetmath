  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is called a *door space* if every subset of $X$\nis either open or closed.\n\nFrom the definition, it is immediately clear that any discrete space is\ndoor.\n\nTo find more examples, let us look at the singletons of a door space\n$X$. For each $x\\in X$, either $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is open or closed.\nCall a point $x$ in $X$ open or closed according to whether\n$\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is open or closed. Let $A$ be the collection of open\npoints in $X$. If $A=X$, then $X$ is discrete. So suppose now that\n$A\\ne X$. We look at the special case when $X-A=\\lbrace x\\rbrace$. It is\nnow easy to see that the topology $\\tau$ generated by all the open\nsingletons makes $X$ a door space:\n\nIf $B\\subseteq X$ does not contain $x$, it is the union of elements in\n$A$, and therefore open. If $x\\in B$, then its complement $B^c$ does\nnot, so is open, and therefore $B$ is closed.\n\nSince $\\tau=P(A)\\cup \\lbrace X\\rbrace$, the space $X$ not discrete. In\naddition, $X$ and $\\varnothing$ are the only clopen sets in $X$.\n\nWhen $X-A$ has more than one element, the situation is a little more\ncomplicated. We know that if $X$ is door, then its topology\n$\\mathcal{T}$ is strictly finer then the topology $\\tau$ generated by\nall the open singletons. McCartan has shown that\n$\\mathcal{T}=\\tau \\cup \\mathcal{U}$ for some ultrafilter in $X$. In\nfact, McCartan showed $\\mathcal{T}$, as well as the previous two\nexamples, are the only types of possible topologies on a set making it a\ndoor space.\n\n[9]{} J.L.
