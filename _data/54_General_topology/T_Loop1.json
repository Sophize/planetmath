  "definition": "A [*loop*]{} based at $x_0$ in a topological space $X$ is simply a\ncontinuous map $f : [0,1]\\to X$ with $f(0) = f(1) = x_0$.\n\nThe collection of all such loops, modulo homotopy equivalence, forms a\ngroup known as the fundamental group.\n\nMore generally, the space of loops in $X$ based at $x_0$ with the\ncompact-open topology, represented by $\\Omega_{x_0}$, is known as the\nloop space of $X$. And one has the homotopy groups\n$\\pi_n(X,x_0) = \\pi_{n-1}(\\Omega_{x_0},\\iota)$, where $\\pi_n$ represents\nthe higher homotopy groups, and $\\iota$ is the basepoint in\n$\\Omega_{x_0}$ consisting of the constant loop at $x_0$.",
