  "definition": "Let $X$ be a set. Let $L$ be the set of all topologies on $X$. We may\norder $L$ by inclusion. When $\\mathcal{T}_1\\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_2$, we\nsay that $\\mathcal{T}_2$ is than $\\mathcal{T}_1$, or that\n$\\mathcal{T}_2$ refines $\\mathcal{T}_1$.\n\n$L$, ordered by inclusion, is a complete lattice.\n\nClearly $L$ is a partially ordered set when ordered by $\\subseteq$.\nFurthermore, given any family of topologies $\\mathcal{T}_i$ on $X$,\ntheir intersection $\\bigcap \\mathcal{T}_i$ also defines a topology on\n$X$. Finally, let $\\mathcal{B}_i$\u2019s be the corresponding subbases for\nthe $\\mathcal{T}_i$\u2019s and let $\\mathcal{B}=\\bigcup \\mathcal{B}_i$. Then\n$\\mathcal{T}$ generated by $\\mathcal{B}$ is easily seen to be the\nsupremum of the $\\mathcal{T}_i$\u2019s.\n\nLet $L$ be the lattice of topologies on $X$. Given $\\mathcal{T}_i\\in L$,\n$\\mathcal{T}:=\\bigvee \\mathcal{T}_i$ is called the *common refinement*\nof $\\mathcal{T}_i$. By the proof above, this is the coarsest topology\nthat is than each $\\mathcal{T}_i$.\n\nIf $X$ is non-empty with more than one element, $L$ is also an atomic\nlattice. Each atom is a topology generated by one non-trivial subset of\n$X$ (non-trivial being non-empty and not $X$). The atom has the form\n$\\lbrace \\varnothing, A, X\\rbrace$, where\n$\\varnothing \\subset A\\subset X$.\n\n**Remark**. In general, a *lattice of topologies* on a set $X$ is a\nsublattice of *the* lattice of topologies $L$ (mentioned above) on $X$.",
