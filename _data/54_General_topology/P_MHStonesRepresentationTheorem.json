  "statement": "Given a Boolean algebra $B$ there exists a totally disconnected compact\nHausdorff space $X$ such that $B$ is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra\nof clopen subsets of $X$.\n\nLet $X=B^*$, the of $B$, which is composed of all maximal ideals of $B$.\nAccording to this , $X$ is a Boolean space (totally disconnected compact\nHausdorff) whose topology is generated by the basis\n$$\\mathcal{B}:=\\lbrace M(a)\\mid a\\in B\\rbrace,$$ where\n$M(a)=\\lbrace M\\in B^* \\mid a\\notin M\\rbrace$.\n\nNext, we show a general fact about the dual space $B^*$:\n\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is the set of *all* clopen sets in $X$.\n\nClearly, every element of $\\mathcal{B}$ is clopen, by definition.\nConversely, suppose $U$ is clopen. Then\n$U=\\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_i)\\mid i\\in I\\rbrace$ for some index set $I$,\nsince $U$ is open. But $U$ is closed, so\n$B^*-U=\\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_j) \\mid j\\in J\\rbrace$ for some index set\n$J$. Hence $B^*=\\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_k) \\mid k\\in I\\cup J \\rbrace$. Since\n$B^*$ is compact, there is a finite subset $K$ of $I\\cup J$ such that\n$B^* =\\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_k)\\mid k\\in K\\rbrace$. Let\n$V= \\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_i)\\mid i\\in K\\cap I\\rbrace$. Then\n$V\\subseteq U$. But $B^*-V \\subseteq B^*-U$ also. So $U=V$. Let\n$y=\\bigvee \\lbrace a_i \\mid i\\in K\\cap I\\rbrace$, which exists because\n$K\\cap I$ is finite. As a result,\n$$U=V= \\bigcup \\lbrace M(a_i)\\mid i\\in K\\cap I\\rbrace = M(\\bigvee \\lbrace a_i\\mid i\\in K\\cap I\\rbrace)=M(y)\\in \\mathcal{B}.$$\n\nFinally, based on the result of , $B$ is isomorphic to the field of sets\n$$F:=\\lbrace F(a)\\mid a\\in B\\rbrace,$$ where\n$F(a)=\\lbrace P\\mid P\\mbox{ prime in }B,\\mbox{ and }a\\notin P\\rbrace$.\nRealizing that prime ideals and maximal ideals coincide in any Boolean\nalgebra, the set $F$ is precisely $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n**Remark**. There is also a dual version of the Stone representation\ntheorem, which says that every Boolean space is homeomorphic to the dual\nspace of some Boolean algebra.",
