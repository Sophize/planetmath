  "definition": "The *Alexandrov one-point compactification* of a non-compact topological\nspace $X$ is obtained by adjoining a new point $\\infty$ and defining the\ntopology on $X\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ to consist of the open sets of $X$\ntogether with the sets of the form $U\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$, where $U$ is an\nopen subset of $X$ with compact complement.\n\nWith this topology, $X\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is always compact. Furthermore, it\nis Hausdorff if and only if $X$ is Hausdorff and locally compact.",
