  "definition": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $A$ be a subspace of $Y$.\nGiven a continuous function ${f:{A\\rightarrow X}},$ define the space\n$Z := X\\cup_f Y$ to be the quotient space $X{\\amalg}Y/\\sim,$ where the\nsymbol ${\\amalg}$ stands for disjoint union and the equivalence relation\n$\\sim$ is generated by $$y \\sim f(y)\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad y\\in A.$$\n$Z$ is called an [*adjunction*]{} of $Y$ to $X$ along $f$ (or along $A$,\nif the map $f$ is understood). This construction has the effect of\ngluing the subspace $A$ of $Y$ to its image in $X$ under $f.$\n\nThough the definition makes sense for arbitrary $A$, it is usually\nassumed that $A$ is a closed subspace of $Y$. This results in\nbetter-behaved adjunction spaces (e.g., the quotient of $X$ by a\nnon-closed set is never Hausdorff).\n\nThe adjunction space construction is a special case of the pushout in\nthe category of topological spaces. The two maps being pushed out are\n$f$ and the inclusion map of $A$ into $Y$.",
