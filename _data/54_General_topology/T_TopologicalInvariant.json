  "definition": "A [*topological invariant*]{} of a space $X$ is a property that depends\nonly on the topology of the space, i.e. it is shared by any topological\nspace homeomorphic to $X$. Common examples include , , , Euler\ncharacteristic, , , and like homology, homotopy groups, and K-theory.\n\nProperties of a space depending on an extra structure such as a metric\n(i.e. volume, curvature, symplectic invariants) typically are not\ntopological invariants, though sometimes there are useful\ninterpretations of topological invariants which seem to depend on extra\ninformation like a metric (for example, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem).",
