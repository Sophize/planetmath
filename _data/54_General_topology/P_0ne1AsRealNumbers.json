  "statement": "The real numbers 0 and 1 are distinct.\n\nThere are four relatively common ways of constructing the real numbers.\nOne can start with the natural numbers and augment it by adding\nsolutions to particular classes of equations, ultimately considering\neither equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers or\nDedekind cuts of rational numbers. One can instead define the real\nnumbers to be the unique (up to isomorphism) ordered field with the\nleast upper bound property. Finally, one can characterise the real\nnumbers as equivalence classes of possibly infinite strings over the\nalphabet $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,.\\}$ satisfying certain conditions. We\noffer a proof for each characterisation.\n\nThis construction proceeds by starting with a standard model of Peano\narithmetic, the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$, extending to $\\mathbb{Z}$\nby adding additive inverses, extending to $\\mathbb{Q}$ by taking the\nfield of fractions of $\\mathbb{Z}$, and finally defining $\\mathbb{R}$ to\nbe the set of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in $\\mathbb{Q}$\nfor an appropriately defined equivalence relation.\n\nThere is a natural embedding $i\\!:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by\nsending a given number $x$ to the equivalence class of the constant\nsequence $(x,\\,x,\\,\\dots)$. Since $i$ is injective and $0$ and $1$ are\nelements of $\\mathbb{N}$, to prove that $0\\ne 1$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ we need\nonly show that $0\\ne 1$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe name $1$ is a label for the successor $S0$ of $0$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\nOne of the axioms of Peano arithmetic states that $0$ is not the\nsuccessor of any number. Therefore $0\\ne S0$ in $\\mathbb{N}$, and so\n$0\\ne 1$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis construction agrees with the previous one up to constructing the\nrationals $\\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\\mathbb{R}$ is defined to be the set of\nall Dedekind cuts on $\\mathbb{Q}$. Letting $x_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ represent\nthe name of an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $x_{\\mathbb{R}}$ represent\nthe name of an element of $\\mathbb{R}$, we define $$\\begin{aligned}\n0_{\\mathbb{R}} &= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{Q} | x < 0_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\} \\\\\n1_{\\mathbb{R}} &= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{Q} | x < 1_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\}\\end{aligned}$$\nThe proof that $0_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\ne 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is similar to the\nprevious proof. Observe that $0_{\\mathbb{Q}} < 1_{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Since no\nnumber is less than itself, it follows that\n$0_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\notin 0_{\\mathbb{R}}$ but\n$0_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\in 1_{\\mathbb{R}}$. Thus these Dedekind cuts are not\nequal.\n\nHere the fact that $0\\ne 1$ is a consequence of the field axiom\nrequiring $0$ and $1$ to be distinct.\n\nIf one defines $$\\begin{aligned}\n0 &= \\overline{(0, 0, 0, 0, \\dots)} \\\\\n1 &= \\overline{(1, 0, 0, 0, \\dots)}\\end{aligned}$$ then since neither\ndefining string ends with a tail of 9s and the strings differ in one\nposition, their equivalence classes are distinct.",
