  "definition": "**Definition**. A set $X$ that is both a topological space and a poset\nis variously called a *topological ordered space*, *ordered topological\nspace*, or simply an *ordered space*. Note that there is no\ncompatibility conditions imposed on $X$. In other words, the topology\n$\\mathcal{T}$ and the partial ordering $\\le$ on $X$ operate\nindependently of one another.\n\nIf the partial order is a total order, then $X$ is called a *totally\nordered space*. In some literature, a totally ordered space is called an\nordered space. In this entry, however, an ordered space is always a\n*partially* ordered space.\n\nOne can construct an ordered space from a set with fewer structures.\n\n1.  For example, any topological space is trivially an ordered space,\n    with the partial order defined by $a\\le b$ iff $a=b$. But this is\n    not so interesting. A more interesting example is to take a $T_0$\n    space $X$, and define $a\\le b$ iff\n    $a\\in \\overline{\\lbrace b\\rbrace}$. The relation so defined turns\n    out to be a partial order on $X$, called the specialization order,\n    making $X$ an ordered space.\n\n2.  On the other hand, given any poset $P$, we can arbitrarily assign a\n    topology on it, making it an ordered space, so that every poset is\n    trivially an ordered space. Again this is not very interesting.\n\n3.  A slightly more useful example is to take a poset $P$, and take\n    $$\\mathcal{L}(P):=\\lbrace P-{\\uparrow\\!\\!}x\\mid x\\in P\\rbrace,$$ the\n    family of all set complements of principal upper sets of $P$, as the\n    subbasis for the topology $\\omega(P)$ of $P$. The topology\n    $\\omega(P)$ so generated is called the *lower topology* on $P$.\n\n4.  Dually, if we take\n    $$\\mathcal{U}(P):=\\lbrace P-{\\downarrow\\!\\!}x\\mid x\\in P\\rbrace,$$\n    as the subbasis, we get the *upper topology* on $P$, denoted by\n    $\\nu(P)$.\n\n5.  In the lower topology $\\omega(P)$ of $P$, if\n    $y\\in P-{\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$, then either $y< x$ (strict inequality) or\n    $x\\shortparallel y$ (incomparable with $x$). If $x$ is an isolated\n    element, then $P-{\\uparrow\\!\\!}x=P-\\lbrace x\\rbrace$. This means\n    that $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is a closed set. Similarly,\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is closed in the upper topology $\\nu(P)$.\n\n    If $x$ is the top element of $P$, then $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is a\n    closed set in $\\omega(P)$, since\n    $P-{\\uparrow\\!\\!}x=P-\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is open. Similarly\n    $\\lbrace x\\rbrace$ is closed in $\\nu(P)$ if $x$ is the bottom\n    element in $P$.\n\n    If $P$ is totally ordered, there are no isolated elements. As a\n    result, we may write $P-{\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$ in a more familiar fashion:\n    $(-\\infty,x)$. Similarly, $P-{\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ may be written as\n    $(x,\\infty)$.\n\n6.  Things get more interesting when we take the common refinement of\n    $\\omega(P)$ and $\\nu(P)$. What we end up with is called the\n    *interval topology* of $P$.\n\n    When $P$ is totally ordered, the interval topology on $P$ has\n    $$\\mathcal{I}(P):=\\lbrace (x,y)\\mid x,y\\in P\\rbrace$$ as a subbasis,\n    where $(x,y)$ denotes the *open* poset interval, consisting of\n    elements $a\\in P$ such that $x<a<y$. Since finite intersections of\n    open poset intervals is a poset interval, an open set in $P$ can be\n    written as an (arbitrary) union of open poset intervals.\n\n    As an example, the usual topology on $\\mathbb{R}$ is precisely the\n    interval topology generated by the linear order on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Remark**. It is a common practice in mathematics to impose special\ncompatibility conditions on a structure having two inherent\nsubstructures so the substructures inter-relate, so that one can derive\nmore interesting fruitful results. This is true also in the case of an\nordered space. Let $X$ be an ordered space. Below are some of the common\nconditions that can be imposed on $X$:\n\n-   $X$ is said to be *upper semiclosed* if ${\\uparrow\\!\\!}x$ is a\n    closed set for every $x\\in X$.\n\n-   Similarly, $X$ is *lower semiclosed* if ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}x$ is\n    closed in $X$.\n\n-   $X$ is *semiclosed* if it is both upper and lower semiclosed.\n\n-   If $\\le$, as a subset of $X\\times X$, is closed in the product\n    topology, then $X$ is called a *pospace*.\n\nOther structures, such as ordered topological vector spaces, , and are\nordered spaces with algebraic structures satisfying certain additional\ncompatibility conditions.
