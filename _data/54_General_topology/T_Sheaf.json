A\n*presheaf* on $X$ with values in ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is a contravariant\nfunctor $F$ from the category $\\mathcal{B}$ whose objects are open sets\nin $X$ and whose morphisms are inclusion mappings of open sets of $X$,\nto the category ${\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nAs this definition may be less than helpful to many readers, we offer\nthe following equivalent (but longer) definition. A *presheaf* $F$ on\n$X$ consists of the following data:\n\n1.  An object $F(U)$ in ${\\mathcal{A}}$, for each open set $U \\subset X$\n\n2.  A morphism ${\\operatorname{res}}_{V,U}\\colon F(V) \\to F(U)$ for each\n    pair of open sets $U \\subset V$ in $X$ (called the *restriction\n    morphism*), such that:\n\n    1.  For every open set $U \\subset X$, the morphism\n        ${\\operatorname{res}}_{U,U}$ is the identity morphism.\n\n    2.  For any open sets $U \\subset V \\subset W$ in $X$, the diagram\n        $$\\xymatrix{\n        F(W) \\ar@/^1pc/[rr]^{{\\operatorname{res}}_{W,U}} \\ar[r]_{{\\operatorname{res}}_{W,V}} & F(V)\n        \\ar[r]_{{\\operatorname{res}}_{V,U}} & F(U)\n        }$$ commutes.\n\nIf the object $F(U)$ of ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is a set, its elements are\ncalled *sections* of $U$.\n\nMorphisms of Presheaves\n=======================\n\nLet $f\\colon X \\to Y$ be a continuous map of topological spaces. Suppose\n$F_X$ is a presheaf on $X$, and $G_Y$ is a presheaf on $Y$ (with $F_X$\nand $G_Y$ both having values in ${\\mathcal{A}}$). We define a *morphism\nof presheaves* $\\phi$ from $G_Y$ to $F_X$, relative to $f$, to be a\ncollection of morphisms $\\phi_U\\colon G_Y(U) \\to F_X(f^{-1}(U))$ in\n${\\mathcal{A}}$, one for every open set $U \\subset Y$, such that the\ndiagram $$\\xymatrix{\nG_Y(V) \\ar[r]^-{\\phi_V} \\ar[d]_{{\\operatorname{res}}_{V,U}} & F_X(f^{-1}(V))\n\\ar[d]^{{\\operatorname{res}}_{f^{-1}(V),f^{-1}(U)}} \\\\\nG_Y(U) \\ar[r]_-{\\phi_U} & F_X(f^{-1}(U))\n}$$ commutes, for each pair of open sets $U \\subset V$ in $Y$.\n\nAlternatively, a morphism of presheaves can be regarded as a natural\ntransformation from $G_Y$ to $F_Y$, where $F_Y$ is the presheaf on $Y$\ngiven by $F_Y(U) := F_X(f^{-1}(U))$. In the special case that $f$ is the\nidentity map ${\\operatorname{id}}\\colon X \\to X$, we omit mention of the\nmap $f$, and speak of $\\phi$ as simply a morphism of presheaves on $X$.\n\nForm the category whose objects are presheaves on $X$ and whose\nmorphisms are morphisms of presheaves on $X$. Then an *isomorphism* of\npresheaves $\\phi$ on $X$ is a morphism of presheaves on $X$ which is an\nisomorphism in this category; that is, there exists a morphism\n$\\phi^{-1}$ whose composition with $\\phi$ both ways is the identity\nmorphism.\n\nMore generally, if $f\\colon X \\to Y$ is any homeomorphism of topological\nspaces, a morphism of presheaves $\\phi$ relative to $f$ is an\n*isomorphism* if it admits a two\u2013sided inverse morphism of presheaves\n$\\phi^{-1}$ relative to $f^{-1}$.\n\nSheaves\n=======\n\nWe now assume that the category ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is a concrete category.\nA *sheaf* is a presheaf $F$ on $X$, with values in ${\\mathcal{A}}$, such\nthat for every open set $U \\subset X$, and every open cover $\\{U_i\\}$ of\n$U$, the following two conditions hold:\n\n1.  Any two elements $f_1, f_2 \\in F(U)$ which have identical\n    restrictions to each $U_i$ are equal. That is, if\n    ${\\operatorname{res}}_{U,U_i} f_1 =\n    {\\operatorname{res}}_{U,U_i} f_2$ for every $i$, then $f_1 = f_2$.\n\n2.  Any collection of elements $f_i \\in F(U_i)$ that have common\n    restrictions can be realized as the collective restrictions of a\n    single element of $F(U)$. That is, if\n    ${\\operatorname{res}}_{U_i, U_i \\cap U_j} f_i =\n    {\\operatorname{res}}_{U_j, U_i \\cap U_j} f_j$ for every $i$ and $j$,\n    then there exists an element $f \\in F(U)$ such that\n    ${\\operatorname{res}}_{U,U_i} f = f_i$ for all $i$.\n\nSheaves in abelian categories\n=============================\n\nIf ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is a concrete abelian category, then a presheaf $F$\nis a sheaf if and only if for every open subset $U$ of $X$, the sequence\n$$\\label{exact}\n\\xymatrix{\n0 \\ar[r] & F(U) \\ar[r]^-{{\\operatorname{incl}}} & \\prod_i F(U_i) \\ar[r]^-{{\\operatorname{diff}}} &\n\\prod_{i,j} F(U_i \\cap U_j)\n}$$ is an exact sequence of morphisms in ${\\mathcal{A}}$ for every open\ncover $\\{U_i\\}$ of $U$ in $X$. This diagram requires some explanation,\nbecause we owe the reader a definition of the morphisms\n${\\operatorname{incl}}$ and ${\\operatorname{diff}}$. We start with\n${\\operatorname{incl}}$ (short for \u201cinclusion\u201d). The restriction\nmorphisms $F(U) \\to F(U_i)$ induce a morphism\n$$F(U) \\to \\prod_i F(U_i)$$ to the categorical direct product\n$\\prod_i F(U_i)$, which we define to be ${\\operatorname{incl}}$. The map\n${\\operatorname{diff}}$ (called \u201cdifference\u201d) is defined as follows. For\neach $U_i$, form the morphism\n$$\\alpha_i\\colon F(U_i) \\to \\prod_j F(U_i \\cap U_j).$$ By the universal\nproperties of categorical direct product, there exists a unique morphism\n$$\\alpha\\colon \\prod_i F(U_i) \\to \\prod_i \\prod_j F(U_i \\cap U_j)$$ such\nthat $\\pi_i \\alpha = \\alpha_i \\pi_i$ for all $i$, where $\\pi_i$ is\nprojection onto the $i^\\text{th}$ factor. In a similar manner, form the\nmorphism\n$$\\beta\\colon \\prod_j F(U_j) \\to \\prod_j \\prod_i F(U_i \\cap U_j).$$ Then\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are both elements of the set\n$${\\operatorname{Hom}}\\left(\\prod_i F(U_i), \\prod_{i,j} F(U_i \\cap U_j)\\right),$$\nwhich is an abelian group since ${\\mathcal{A}}$ is an abelian category.\nTake the difference $\\alpha - \\beta$ in this group, and define this\nmorphism to be ${\\operatorname{diff}}$.\n\nNote that exactness of the sequence\u00a0 is an element free condition, and\ntherefore makes sense for any abelian category ${\\mathcal{A}}$, even if\n${\\mathcal{A}}$ is not concrete. Accordingly, for any abelian category\n${\\mathcal{A}}$, we define a sheaf to be a presheaf $F$ for which the\nsequence\u00a0 is always exact.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nIt\u2019s high time that we give some examples of sheaves and presheaves. We\nbegin with some of the standard ones.\n\nIf $F$ is a presheaf on $X$, and $U \\subset X$ is an open subset, then\none can define a presheaf $F|_U$ on $U$ by restricting the functor $F$\nto the subcategory of open sets of $X$ in $U$ and inclusion morphisms.\nIn other words, for open subsets of $U$, define $F|_U$ to be exactly\nwhat $F$ was, and ignore open subsets of $X$ that are not open subsets\nof $U$. The resulting presheaf is called, for obvious reasons, the\n*restriction presheaf* of $F$ to $U$, or the *restriction sheaf* if $F$\nwas a sheaf to begin with.\n\nFor any topological space $X$, let ${\\mathcal{C}}_X$ be the presheaf on\n$X$, with values in the category of rings, given by\n\n-   ${\\mathcal{C}}_X(U) := $ the ring of continuous real\u2013valued\n    functions $U\n    \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$,\n\n-   ${\\operatorname{res}}_{V,U} f := $ the restriction of $f$ to $U$,\n    for every element $f\\colon V \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ of\n    ${\\mathcal{C}}_X(V)$ and every subset $U$ of $V$.\n\nThen ${\\mathcal{C}}_X$ is actually a sheaf of rings, because continuous\nfunctions are uniquely specified by their values on an open cover. The\nsheaf ${\\mathcal{C}}_X$ is called the *sheaf of continuous real\u2013valued\nfunctions* on $X$.\n\nLet $X$ be a smooth differentiable manifold. Let ${\\mathcal{D}}_X$ be\nthe presheaf on $X$, with values in the category of real vector spaces,\ndefined by setting ${\\mathcal{D}}_X(U)$ to be the space of smooth\nreal\u2013valued functions on $U$, for each open set $U$, and with the\nrestriction morphism given by restriction of functions as before. Then\n${\\mathcal{D}}_X$ is a sheaf as well, called the *sheaf of smooth\nreal\u2013valued functions* on $X$.\n\nMuch more surprising is that the construct ${\\mathcal{D}}_X$ can\nactually be used to [**define**]{} the concept of smooth manifold! That\nis, one can define a smooth manifold to be a locally Euclidean\n$n$\u2013dimensional second countable topological space $X$, together with a\nsheaf $F$, such that there exists an open cover $\\{U_i\\}$ of $X$ where:\n\n> For every $i$, there exists a homeomorphism\n> $f_i\\colon U_i \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^n$ and an isomorphism of sheaves\n> $\\phi_i\\colon {\\mathcal{D}}_{{\\mathbb{R}}^n} \\to F|_{U_i}$ relative to\n> $f_i$.\n\nThe idea here is that not only does every smooth manifold $X$ have a\nsheaf ${\\mathcal{D}}_X$ of smooth functions, but specifying this sheaf\nof smooth functions is sufficient to fully describe the smooth manifold\nstructure on $X$. While this phenomenon may seem little more than a toy\ncuriousity for differential geometry, it arises in full force in the\nfield of algebraic geometry where the coordinate functions are often\nunwieldy and algebraic structures in many cases can only be\nsatisfactorily described by way of sheaves and schemes.\n\nSimilarly, for a complex analytic manifold $X$, one can form the sheaf\n${\\mathcal{H}}_X$ of holomorphic functions by setting\n${\\mathcal{H}}_X(U)$ equal to the complex vector space of\n${\\mathbb{C}}$\u2013valued holomorphic functions on $U$, with the restriction\nmorphism being restriction of functions as before.\n\nThe algebraic geometry analogue of the sheaf ${\\mathcal{D}}_X$ of\ndifferential geometry is the prime spectrum $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ of\na commutative ring $R$. However, the construction of the sheaf\n$\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is beyond the scope of this discussion and\nmerits a separate article.\n\nFor an example of a presheaf that is not a sheaf, consider the presheaf\n$F$ on $X$, with values in the category of real vector spaces, whose\nsections on $U$ are locally constant real\u2013valued functions on $U$ modulo\nconstant functions on $U$. Then every section $f \\in F(U)$ is locally\nzero in some fine enough open cover $\\{U_i\\}$ (it is enough to take a\ncover where each $U_i$ is connected), whereas $f$ may be nonzero if $U$\nis not connected.\n\nWe conclude with some interesting examples of morphisms of sheaves,\nchosen to illustrate the unifying power of the language of schemes\nacross various diverse branches of mathematics.\n\n1.  For any continuous function $f\\colon X \\to Y$, the map $\\phi_U\\colon\n    {\\mathcal{C}}_Y(U) \\to {\\mathcal{C}}_X(f^{-1}(U))$ given by\n    $\\phi_U(g) := gf$ defines a morphisms of sheaves from\n    ${\\mathcal{C}}_Y$ to ${\\mathcal{C}}_X$ with respect to $f$.\n\n2.  For any continuous function $f\\colon X \\to Y$ of smooth\n    differentiable manifolds, the map given by $\\phi_U(g) := gf$ has the\n    property\n    $$g \\in {\\mathcal{D}}_Y(U) \\implies \\phi_U(g) \\in {\\mathcal{D}}_X(f^{-1}(U))$$\n    if and only if $f$ is a smooth function.\n\n3.  For any continuous function $f\\colon X \\to Y$ of complex analytic\n    manifolds, the map given by $\\phi_U(g) := gf$ has the property\n    $$g \\in {\\mathcal{H}}_Y(U) \\implies \\phi_U(g) \\in {\\mathcal{H}}_X(f^{-1}(U))$$\n    if and only if $f$ is a holomorphic function.\n\n4.  For any Zariski continuous function $f\\colon X \\to Y$ of algebraic\n    varieties over a field $k$, the map given by $\\phi_U(g) := gf$ has\n    the property\n    $$g \\in {\\mathcal{O}}_Y(U) \\implies \\phi_U(g) \\in {\\mathcal{O}}_X(f^{-1}(U))$$\n    if and only if $f$ is a regular function. Here ${\\mathcal{O}}_X$\n    denotes the sheaf of $k$\u2013valued regular functions on the algebraic\n    variety $X$.\n\n[9]{} David Mumford, *The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes, Second\nExpanded Edition*, Springer\u2013Verlag, 1999 (LNM [**1358**]{}).
