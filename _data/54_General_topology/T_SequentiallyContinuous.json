Then a $f : X \\rightarrow Y$ is said\nto be *sequentially continuous* if for every convergent sequence\n$x_n \\rightarrow x$ in $X$, $f(x_n) \\rightarrow f(x)$ in $Y$.\n\nEvery continuous function is sequentially continuous, however the\nconverse is true only in first-countable spaces (for example in metric\nspaces).",
