  "definition": "[@steen; @willard] Suppose $X$ is a topological space. If $X$ has a\nbasis consising of clopen sets, then $X$ is said to be .\n\nExamples of zero-dimensional spaces are: the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ of\nrational numbers (with subspace topology induced from the usual metric\ntopology on $\\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers), the Cantor space, as\nwell as the Sorgenfrey line.\n\nThe concepts of zero-dimentionality and total disconnectedness are\nclosely related. Indeed, every zero-dimentional is totally disconnected.\nFurthermore, if a topological space is locally compact and Hausdorff,\nthen the notions of zero-dimentionality and total disconnectedness are\nequivalent.\n\n[9]{} L.A.
