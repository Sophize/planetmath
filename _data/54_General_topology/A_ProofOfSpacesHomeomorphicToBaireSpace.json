  "argumentText": "We show that a topological space $X$ is homeomorphic to Baire space,\n$\\mathcal{N}$, if and only if the following are satisfied.\n\n1.  \\[item:1\\] It is a nonempty Polish space.\n\n2.  \\[item:2\\] It is zero dimensional.\n\n3.  \\[item:3\\] No nonempty and open subsets are compact.\n\nAs Baire space is easily shown to satisfy these properties, we just need\nto show that if they are satisfied then there exists a homeomorphism\n$f\\colon\\mathcal{N}\\rightarrow X$. By property \\[item:1\\] there is a\ncomplete metric $d$ on $X$.\n\nWe choose subsets $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ of $X$ for integers $k\\ge 0$ and\n$n_1,\\ldots,n_k$ satisfying the following.\n\n1.  $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ is a nonempty clopen set with diameter no more\n    than $2^{-k}$.\n\n2.  $C()= X$.\n\n3.  For any $n_1,\\ldots,n_k$ then $C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)$ are pairwise\n    disjoint as $m$ ranges over the natural numbers and, $$\\label{eq:1}\n    \\bigcup_{m=1}^\\infty C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,m)=C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k).$$\n\nThis can be done inductively. Suppose that $S=C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ has\nalready been chosen. As it is open, condition \\[item:3\\] says that it is\nnot compact. Therefore, there is a $\\delta>0$ such that $S$ has no\nfinite open cover consisting of sets of diameter no more than $\\delta$\n(see ). However, as Polish spaces are separable, there is a countable\nsequence $S_1,S_2,\\ldots$ of open sets with diameter less than $\\delta$\nand covering $S$. As the space is zero dimensional, these can be taken\nto be clopen. By replacing $S_j$ by $S_j\\cap S$ we can assume that\n$S_j\\subseteq S$. Then, replacing by $S_j\\setminus\\bigcup_{i<j}S_i$, the\nsets $S_j$ can be taken to be pairwise disjoint.\n\nBy eliminating empty sets we suppose that $S_j\\not=\\emptyset$ for each\n$j$, and since $S$ has no finite open cover consisting of sets of\ndiameter less than $\\delta$, the sequence $S_j$ will still be infinite.\nDefining $$C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k,n_{k+1})=S_{n_{k+1}}$$ satisfies the\nrequired properties.\n\nWe now define a function $f\\colon\\mathcal{N}\\rightarrow X$ such that\n$f(n)\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ for each $n\\in\\mathcal{N}$ and $k\\ge 0$.\nChoose any $n\\in\\mathcal{N}$ there is a sequence\n$x_k\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$. This set has diameter bounded by $2^{-k}$\nand, so, $d(x_k,x_j)\\le 2^{-k}$ for $j\\ge k$. This sequence is and, by\ncompleteness of the metric, must converge to a limit $x$. As\n$C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ is closed, it contains $x$ for each $k$ and\ntherefore $$\\bigcap_kC(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\not=\\emptyset.$$ In fact, as it\nhas zero diameter, this set must contain a single element, which we\ndefine to be $f(n)$.\n\nSo, we have defined a function $f\\colon\\mathcal{N}\\rightarrow X$. If\n$m,n\\in \\mathcal{N}$ satisfy $m_j=n_j$ for $j\\le k$ then $f(m),f(n)$ are\nboth contained in $C(m_1,\\ldots,m_k)$ and $d(f(m),f(n))\\le 2^{-k}$.\nTherefore, $f$ is continuous.\n\nIt only remains to show that $f$ has continuous inverse. Given any\n$x\\in X$ then $x\\in C()$ and equation (\\[eq:1\\]) allows us to choose a\nsequence $n_k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $x\\in C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ for each\n$k$. Then, $f(n)=x$ showing that $f$ is onto.\n\nIf $m\\not=n\\in\\mathcal{N}$ then, letting $k$ be the first integer for\nwhich $m_k\\not=n_k$, the sets $C(m_1,\\ldots,m_k)$ and\n$C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ are disjoint and, therefore, $f(m)\\not=f(n)$ and $f$\nis one to one.\n\nFinally, we show that $f$ is an open map, so that its inverse is\ncontinuous. Sets of the form\n$$\\mathcal{N}(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)=\\left\\{m\\in\\mathcal{N}\\colon m_j=n_j\\text{ for }j\\le k\\right\\}$$\nform a basis for the topology on $\\mathcal{N}$. Then,\n$f\\left(\\mathcal{N}(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)\\right)=C(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)$ is open\nand, therefore, $f$ is an open map.",
