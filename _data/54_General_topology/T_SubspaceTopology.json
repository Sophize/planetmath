The\n[*subspace topology*]{} on $Y$ is the topology whose open sets are those\nsubsets of $Y$ which equal $U \\cap Y$ for some open set $U \\subset X$.\n\nIn this context, the topological space $Y$ obtained by taking the\nsubspace topology is called a [*topological subspace*]{}, or simply\n[*subspace*]{}, of $X$.",
