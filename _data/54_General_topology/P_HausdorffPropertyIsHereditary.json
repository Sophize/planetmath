  "statement": "A subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.\n\nLet $ X$ be a Hausdorff space , and let $ Y$ be a subspace of $ X$. Let\n$y_1,y_2 \\in Y$ where $y_1\\neq y_2$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there are\ndisjoint neighborhoods $U_1$ of $y_1$ and $U_2$ of $y_2$ $\\in X$. Then\n$U_1 \\cap Y$ is a neighborhood of $y_1$ in $Y$ and $U_2 \\cap Y$ is a\nneighborhood of $y_2$ in $Y$, and $U_1 \\cap Y$ and $U_2 \\cap Y$ are\ndisjoint. Therefore, $Y$ is Hausdorff.",
