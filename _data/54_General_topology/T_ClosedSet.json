  "definition": "Let $(X,\\tau)$ be a topological space. Then a subset $C\\subseteq X$ is\n*closed* if its complement $X\\setminus C$ is open under the topology\n$\\tau$.\n\nExamples:\n\n-   In any topological space $(X,\\tau)$, the sets $X$ and $\\emptyset$\n    are always closed.\n\n-   Consider $\\R$ with the standard topology. Then $[0,1]$ is closed\n    since its complement $(-\\infty,0) \\cup (1,\\infty)$ is open (being\n    the union of two open sets).\n\n-   Consider $\\R$ with the lower limit topology. Then $[0,1)$ is closed\n    since its complement $(-\\infty,0)\\cup[1,\\infty)$ is open.\n\nClosed subsets can also be characterized as follows:\n\nA subset $C\\subseteq X$ is closed if and only if $C$ contains all of its\ncluster points, that is, $C'\\subseteq C$.\n\nSo the set $\\{1,1/2,1/3,1/4,\\ldots\\}$ is not closed under the standard\ntopology on $\\R$ since $0$ is a cluster point not contained in the set.",
