  "argumentText": "Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a uniformly continuous function from uniform spaces\n$X$ to $Y$ with uniformities $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$\nrespectively. Let $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ be the $\\mathcal{U}$ and\n$\\mathcal{V}$ respectively. It is known that $X$ and $Y$ are proximity\nspaces with proximities $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ respectively.\nFurthermore, we have the following:\n\n$f:X\\to Y$ is proximity continuous.\n\nLet $A,B$ be any subsets of $X$ with $A\\delta B$. We want to show that\n$f(A)\\epsilon f(B)$, or equivalently,\n$$V[f(A)]\\cap V[f(B)]\\ne \\varnothing,$$ for any $V\\in \\mathcal{V}$. Pick\nany $V\\in \\mathcal{V}$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there is\n$U\\in \\mathcal{U}$ such that $$U[x]\\subseteq f^{-1}(V[f(x)]),$$ for any\n$x\\in X$. As a result, $$U[A]\\subseteq f^{-1}(V[f(A)]),$$ which implies\nthat $$f(U[A]) \\subseteq V[f(A)].$$ Similarly\n$f(U[B])\\subseteq V[f(B)]$. Now, $A\\delta B$ is equivalent to\n$U[A]\\cap U[B]\\ne \\varnothing$, so we can pick $$z\\in U[A]\\cap U[B].$$\nThen $$f(z)\\in f(U[A])\\cap f(U[B])\\subseteq V[f(A)]\\cap V[f(B)],$$ and\ntherefore $$V[f(A)]\\cap V[f(B)]\\ne \\varnothing.$$ This shows that $f$ is\nproximity continuous.",
