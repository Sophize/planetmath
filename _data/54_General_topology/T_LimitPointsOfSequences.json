  "definition": "In a topological space $X$, a point $x$ is a *limit point of the\nsequence* $x_0, x_1, \\ldots$ if, for every open set containing $x$,\nthere are finitely many indices such that the corresponding elements of\nthe sequence do not belong to the open set.\n\nA point $x$ is an *accumulation point of the sequence*\n$x_0, x_1, \\ldots$ if, for every open set containing $x$, there are\ninfinitely many indices such that the corresponding elements of the\nsequence belong to the open set.\n\nIt is worth noting that the set of limit points of a sequence can differ\nfrom the set of limit points of the set of elements of the sequence.\nLikewise the set of accumulation points of a sequence can differ from\nthe set of accumulation points of the set of elements of the sequence.\n\nReference: L.
