  "definition": "A property that holds for all $x$ in some residual subset of a Baire\nspace $X$ is said to be *generic* in $X$, or to *hold generically* in\n$X$. In the study of generic properties, it is common to state\n\u201cgenerically, $P(x)$\u201d, where $P(x)$ is some proposition about $x\\in X$.\nThe useful fact about generic properties is that, given countably many\ngeneric properties $P_n$, all of them hold simultaneously in a residual\nset, i.e. we have that, generically, $P_n(x)$ holds for each $n$.",
