If $X$ is a connected space, and $f$ is\nsurjective, then $Y$ is a connected space.\n\nThe inclusion map for spaces $X=(0,1)$ and $Y=(0,1)\\cup(2,3)$ shows that\nwe need to assume that the map is surjective. Othewise, we can only\nprove that $f(X)$ is connected. See .\n\n*Proof.* For a contradiction, suppose there are disjoint open sets $A,B$\nin $Y$ such that $Y=A\\cup B$. By continuity and propertie[s]{} of the\ninverse image, $f^{-1}(A)$ and $f^{-1}(B)$ are open disjoint sets in\n$X$. Since $f$ is surjective, $Y=f(X)=A\\cup B$, whence\n$$X=f^{-1}f(X) = f^{-1}(A)\\cup f^{-1}(B)$$ contradicting the assumption\nthat $X$ is connected.\n\n[9]{} G.J.
