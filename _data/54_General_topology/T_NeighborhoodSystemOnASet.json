  "definition": "In point-set topology, a neighborhood system is defined as the set of\nneighborhoods of some point in the topological space.\n\nHowever, one can start out with the definition of a \u201cabstract\nneighborhood system\u201d $\\mathfrak{N}$ on an arbitrary set $X$ and define a\ntopology $T$ on $X$ based on this system $\\mathfrak{N}$ so that\n$\\mathfrak{N}$ is the neighborhood system of $T$. This is done as\nfollows:\n\n> Let $X$ be a set and $\\mathfrak{N}$ be a subset of $X\\times P(X)$,\n> where $P(X)$ is the power set of $X$. Then $\\mathfrak{N}$ is said to\n> be a *abstract neighborhood system* of $X$ if the following conditions\n> are satisfied:\n>\n> 1.  if $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, then $x\\in U$,\n>\n> 2.  for every $x\\in X$, there is a $U\\subseteq X$ such that\n>     $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$,\n>\n> 3.  if $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ and $U\\subseteq V\\subseteq X$, then\n>     $(x,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$,\n>\n> 4.  if $(x,U),(x,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, then\n>     $(x,U\\cap V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$,\n>\n> 5.  if $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, then there is a $V\\subseteq X$ such\n>     that\n>\n>     -   $(x,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, and\n>\n>     -   $(y,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ for all $y\\in V$.\n>\n> In addition, given this $\\mathfrak{N}$, define the *abstract\n> neighborhood system around* $x\\in X$ to be the subset $\\mathfrak{N}_x$\n> of $\\mathfrak{N}$ consisting of all those elements whose first\n> coordinate is $x$. Evidently, $\\mathfrak{N}$ is the disjoint union of\n> $\\mathfrak{N}_x$ for all $x\\in X$. Finally, let $$\\begin{aligned}\n> T &=& \\lbrace U\\subseteq X\\mid \\mbox{for every }x\\in U\\mbox{, }(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N} \\rbrace \\\\\n> &=& \\lbrace U\\subseteq X\\mid \\mbox{for every }x\\in U\\mbox{, there is a }V\\subseteq U\\mbox{, such that }(x,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N} \\rbrace.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe two definitions are the same by condition 3. We assert that $T$\ndefined above is a topology on $X$. Furthermore,\n$T_x:=\\lbrace U\\mid (x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}_x \\rbrace$ is the set of\nneighborhoods of $x$ under $T$.\n\nWe first show that $T$ is a topology. For every $x\\in X$, some\n$U\\subseteq X$, we have $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ by condition 2. Hence\n$(x,X)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ by condition 3. So $X\\in T$. Also,\n$\\varnothing\\in T$ is vacuously satisfied, for no $x\\in \\varnothing$. If\n$U,V\\in T$, then $U\\cap V\\in T$ by condition 4. Let $\\lbrace U_i\\rbrace$\nbe a subset of $T$ whose elements are indexed by $I$ ($i\\in I$). Let\n$U=\\bigcup U_i$. Pick any $x\\in U$, then $x\\in U_i$ for some $i\\in I$.\nSince $U_i\\in T$, $(x,U_i)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$. Since $U_i\\subseteq U$,\n$(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ by condition 3, so $U\\in T$.\n\nNext, suppose $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of neighborhoods of $x$ under\n$T$. We need to show $\\mathcal{N}=T_x$:\n\n1.  ($\\mathcal{N}\\subseteq T_x$). If $N\\in\\mathcal{N}$, then there is\n    $U\\in T$ with $x\\in U\\subseteq N$. But $(x,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, so\n    by condition 3, $(x,N)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, or\n    $(x,N)\\in \\mathfrak{N}_x$, or $N\\in T_x$.\n\n2.  ($T_x\\subseteq \\mathcal{N}$). Pick any $U\\in T_x$ and set\n    $W=\\lbrace z\\mid U\\in T_z\\rbrace$. Then $x\\in W\\subseteq U$ by\n    condition 1. We show $W$ is open. This means we need to find, for\n    each $z\\in W$, a $V\\subseteq W$ such that $(z,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$.\n    If $z\\in W$, then $(z,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$. By condition 5, there is\n    $V\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ such that $(z,V)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, and for any\n    $y\\in V$, $(y,U)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$, or $y\\in U$ by condition 1. So\n    $y\\in W$ by the definition of $W$, or $V\\subseteq W$. Thus $W$ is\n    open and $U\\in \\mathcal{N}$.\n\nThis completes the proof. By the way, $W$ defined above is none other\nthan the interior of $U$: $W=U^{\\circ}$.\n\n**Remark**. Conversely, if $T$ is a topology on $X$, we can define\n$\\mathfrak{N}_x$ to be the set consisting of $(x,U)$ such that $U$ is a\nneighborhood of $x$. The the union $\\mathfrak{N}$ of $\\mathfrak{N}_x$\nfor each $x\\in X$ satisfies conditions $1$ through $5$ above:\n\n1.  (condition 1): clear\n\n2.  (condition 2): because $(x,X)\\in \\mathfrak{N}$ for each $x\\in X$\n\n3.  (condition 3): if $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and $V$ a supserset\n    of $U$, then $V$ is also a neighborhood of $x$\n\n4.  (condition 4): if $U$ and $V$ are neighborhoods of $x$, there are\n    open $A,B$ with $x\\in A\\subseteq U$ and $x\\in B\\subseteq V$, so\n    $x\\in A\\cap B\\subseteq U\\cap V$, which means $U\\cap V$ is a\n    neighborhood of $x$\n\n5.  (condition 5): if $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$, there is open $A$\n    with $x\\in A\\subseteq U$; clearly $A$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and\n    any $y\\in A$ has $U$ as neighborhood.\n\nSo the definition of a neighborhood system on an arbitrary set gives an\nalternative way of defining a topology on the set. There is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the set of topologies on a set and the set of\nabstract neighborhood systems on the set.",
