  "definition": "The idea of a continuous relation is neither as old nor as\nwell-established as the idea of a continuous function. Different authors\nuse somewhat different definitions. The present article is based on the\nfollowing definition:\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $R$ a relation between $X$ and\n$Y$ ($R$ is a subset of $X\\times Y$). $R$ is said to be if\n\nfor any open subset $V$ of $Y$, $R^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$.\n\nHere $R^{-1}(V)$ is the inverse image of $V$ under $R$, and is defined\nas $$R^{-1}(V):=\\lbrace x\\in X\\mid xRy\\mbox{ for some }y\\in V\\rbrace.$$\nEquivalently, $R$ is a continuous relation if for any open set $V$ of\n$Y$, the set $\\pi_X((X\\times V)\\cap R)$ is open in $X$, where $\\pi_X$ is\nthe projection map $X\\times  Y\\to X$.\n\n**Remark**. Continuous relations are generalization of continuous\nfunctions: if a continuous relation is also a function, then it is a\ncontinuous function.\n\nSome examples.\n\n-   Let $X$ be an ordered space. Then the partial order $\\le$ is\n    continuous iff for every open subset $A$ of $X$, its lower set\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$ is also open in $X$.\n\n    In particular, in $\\mathbb{R}$, the usual linear ordering $\\le$ on\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. To see this, let $A$ be an open subset\n    of $\\mathbb{R}$. If $A=\\varnothing$, then\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A=\\varnothing$ as well, and so is open. Suppose now\n    that $A$ is non-empty and deal with the case when $A$ is not bounded\n    from above. If $r\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then there is $a\\in A$ such that\n    $r\\le a$, so that $r\\in {\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$, which implies\n    ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A=\\mathbb{R}$. Hence ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A$ is open.\n    If $A$ is bounded from above, then $A$ has a supremum (since\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ is Dedekind complete), say $x$. Since $A$ is open,\n    $x\\notin A$ (or else $x\\in (a,b)\\subseteq A$, implying\n    $x<\\frac{x+b}{2}\\in (a,b)$, contradicting the fact that $x$ is the\n    least upper bound of $A$). So ${\\downarrow\\!\\!}A=(-\\infty,x)$, which\n    is open also. Therefore, $\\le$ is a continuous relation on\n    $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n-   Again, we look at the space $\\mathbb{R}$ with its usual interval\n    topology. The relation this time is\n    $R=\\lbrace (x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2=1\\rbrace$. This is not\n    a continuous relation. Take $A=(-2,2)$, which is open. But then\n    $R^{-1}(A)=[-1,1]$, which is closed.\n\n-   Now, let $X$ be a locally connected topological space. For any\n    $x,y\\in X$, define $x\\sim y$ iff $x$ and $y$ belong to the same\n    connected component of $X$. Let $A$ be an open subset of $X$. Then\n    $B=\\sim^{-1}(A)$ is the union of all connected components containing\n    points of $A$. Since (it can be shown) each connected component is\n    open, so is their union, and hence $B$ is open. Thus $\\sim$ is a\n    continuous relation.\n\n-   If $R$ is symmetric, then $R$ is continuous iff $R^{-1}$ is. In\n    particular, in a topological space $X$, an equivalence relation\n    $\\sim$ on $X$ is continuous iff the projection $p$ of $X$ onto the\n    quotient space $X/\\sim$ is an open mapping.\n\n**Remark**. Alternative definitions: One apparently common definition\n(as described by Wyler) is to require inverse images of open sets to be\nopen and inverse images of closed sets to be closed (making the relation\nupper and lower semi-continuous). Wyler suggests the following\ndefinition: If $r\\colon e\\to f$ is a relation between topological spaces\n$E$ and $F$, then $r$ is continuous iff for each topological space $A$,\nand functions $f\\colon A\\to E$ and $g\\colon A\\to F$ such that\n$f(u) \\mathrel{r} g(u)$ for all $u\\in A$, continuity of $f$ implies\ncontinuity of $g$.\n\n[8]{} T.\u00a0S.\u00a0Blyth, *Lattices and Ordered Algebraic Structures*,\nSpringer, New York (2005).
