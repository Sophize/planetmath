  "definition": "A topological space $ X$ is [*connected im kleinen at a point*]{} $ x $\nif every open set $ U$ containing $ x$ contains an open set $ V$\ncontaining $ x$ such that if $ y$ is a point of $ V$, then there is a\nconnected subset of $ U$ containing $\\{x,y\\}$.\\\nAnother way to say this is that $X$ is connected im kleinen at a point\n$x$ if $x$ has a neighborhood base of connected sets (not necessarily\nopen).\n\nA locally connected space is connected im kleinen at each point.\n\nA space can be connected im kleinen at a point but not locally connected\nat the point.\n\nIf a topological space is connected im kleinen at each point, then it is\nlocally connected.\n\n[9]{} S.
