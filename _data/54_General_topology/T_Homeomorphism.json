We also say that two spaces\nare *homeomorphic* if such a map exists.\n\nIf two topological spaces are homeomorphic, they are topologically\nequivalent \u2014 using the techniques of topology, there is no way of\ndistinguishing one space from the other.\n\nAn *autohomeomorphism* (also known as a *self-homeomorphism*) is a\nhomeomorphism from a topological space to itself.",
