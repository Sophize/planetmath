  "definition": "A topological space $X$ is [*compact*]{} if, for every collection\n$\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ of open sets in $X$ whose union is $X$, there exists\na finite subcollection $\\{U_{i_j}\\}_{j=1}^n$ whose union is also $X$.\n\nA subset $Y$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be compact if $Y$\nwith its subspace topology is a compact topological space.\n\n**Note:** Some authors require that a compact topological space be\nHausdorff as well, and use the term quasi-compact to refer to a\nnon-Hausdorff compact space. The modern convention seems to be to use\ncompact in the sense given here, but the old definition is still\noccasionally encountered (particularly in the French school).",
