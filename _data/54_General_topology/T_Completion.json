  "definition": "Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Let $\\bar{X}$ be the set of all Cauchy\nsequences $\\{x_n\\}_{n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}}$ in $X$. Define an equivalence\nrelation $\\sim$ on $\\bar{X}$ by setting $\\{x_n\\} \\sim \\{y_n\\}$ if the\ninterleave sequence of the sequences $\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{y_n\\}$ is also a\nCauchy sequence. The [*completion*]{} of $X$ is defined to be the set\n$\\hat{X}$ of equivalence classes of $\\bar{X}$ modulo $\\sim$.\n\nThe metric $d$ on $X$ extends to a metric on $\\hat{X}$ in the following\nmanner: $$d(\\{x_n\\},\\{y_n\\}) := \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} d(x_n,y_n),$$ where\n$\\{x_n\\}$ and $\\{y_n\\}$ are representative Cauchy sequences of elements\nin $\\hat{X}$. The definition of $\\sim$ is tailored so that the limit in\nthe above definition is well defined, and the fact that these sequences\nare Cauchy, together with the fact that ${\\mathbb{R}}$ is complete,\nensures that the limit exists. The space $\\hat{X}$ with this metric is\nof course a complete metric space.\n\nThe original metric space $X$ is isometric to the subset of $\\hat{X}$\nconsisting of equivalence classes of constant sequences.\n\nNote the similarity between the construction of $\\hat{X}$ and the\nconstruction of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ from ${\\mathbb{Q}}$. The process used\nhere is the same as that used to construct the real numbers\n${\\mathbb{R}}$, except for the minor detail that one can not use the\nterminology of metric spaces in the construction of ${\\mathbb{R}}$\nitself because it is necessary to construct ${\\mathbb{R}}$ in the first\nplace before one can define metric spaces.\n\nMetric spaces with richer structure\n===================================\n\nIf the metric space $X$ has an algebraic structure, then in many cases\nthis algebraic structure carries through unchanged to $\\hat{X}$ simply\nby applying it one element at a time to sequences in $X$. We will not\nattempt to state this principle precisely, but we will mention the\nfollowing important instances:\n\n1.  If $(X,\\cdot)$ is a topological group, then $\\hat{X}$ is also a\n    topological group with multiplication defined by\n    $$\\{x_n\\} \\cdot \\{y_n\\} = \\{x_n \\cdot y_n\\}.$$\n\n2.  If $X$ is a topological ring, then addition and multiplication\n    extend to $\\hat{X}$ and make the completion into a topological ring.\n\n3.  If $F$ is a field with a valuation $v$, then the completion of $F$\n    with respect to the metric imposed by $v$ is a topological field,\n    denoted $F_v$ and called the completion of $F$ at $v$.\n\nUniversal property of completions\n=================================\n\nThe completion $\\hat{X}$ of $X$ satisfies the following universal\nproperty: for every uniformly continuous map $f: X {\\longrightarrow}Y$\nof $X$ into a complete metric space $Y$, there exists a unique lifting\nof $f$ to a continuous map $\\hat{f}: \\hat{X} {\\longrightarrow}Y$ making\nthe diagram $$\\xymatrix{\nX \\ar[rr]^f \\ar[dr] & & Y \\\\\n& \\hat{X} \\ar[ur]_{\\hat{f}}\n}$$ commute. Up to isomorphism, the completion of $X$ is the unique\nmetric space satisfying this property. The ability to extend uniformly\ncontinuous functions from $X$ to $\\hat{X}$ is often the reason why\nalgebraic structures on $X$ extend to $\\hat{X}$ as described in the\nprevious section.",
