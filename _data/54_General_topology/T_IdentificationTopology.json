  "definition": "Let $f$ be a function from a topological space $X$ to a set $Y$. The\n*identification topology* on $Y$ with respect to $f$ is defined to be\nthe finest topology on $Y$ such that the function $f$ is continuous.\n\nLet $f:X\\to Y$ be defined as above. The following are equivalent:\n\n1.  $\\mathcal{T}$ is the identification topology on $Y$.\n\n2.  $U\\subseteq Y$ is open under $\\mathcal{T}$ iff $f^{-1}(U)$ is open\n    in $X$.\n\n($1.\\Rightarrow 2.$) If $U$ is open under $\\mathcal{T}$, then\n$f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ as $f$ is continuous under $\\mathcal{T}$.\nNow, suppose $U$ is not open under $\\mathcal{T}$ and $f^{-1}(U)$ is open\nin $X$. Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be a subbase of $\\mathcal{T}$. Define\n$\\mathcal{B}':=\\mathcal{B}\\cup \\lbrace U\\rbrace$. Then the topology\n$\\mathcal{T}'$ generated by $\\mathcal{B}'$ is a strictly finer topology\nthan $\\mathcal{T}$ making $f$ continuous, a contradiction.\n\n($2.\\Rightarrow 1.$) Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the topology defined by 2.\nThen $f$ is continuous. Suppose $\\mathcal{T}'$ is another topology on\n$Y$ making $f$ continuous. Let $U$ be $\\mathcal{T}'$-open. Then\n$f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$, which implies $U$ is $\\mathcal{T}$-open.\nThus $\\mathcal{T}'\\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ is finer than\n$\\mathcal{T}'$.\n\n**Remarks**.\n\n-   $\\mathcal{S}=\\lbrace f(V)\\mid V\\mbox{ is open in }X\\rbrace$ is a\n    subbasis for $f(X)$, using the subspace topology on $f(X)$ of the\n    identification topology on $Y$.\n\n-   More generally, let $X_i$ be a family of topological spaces and\n    $f_i:X_i\\to Y$ be a family of functions from $X_i$ into $Y$. The\n    *identification topology* on $Y$ with respect to the family $f_i$ is\n    the finest topology on $Y$ making each $f_i$ a continuous function.\n    In literature, this topology is also called the *final topology*.\n\n-   The dual concept of this is the initial topology.\n\n-   Let $f:X\\to Y$ be defined as above. Define binary relation $\\sim$ on\n    $X$ so that $x\\sim y$ iff $f(x)=f(y)$. Clearly $\\sim$ is an\n    equivalence relation. Let $X^*$ be the quotient $X/\\sim$. Then $f$\n    induces an injective map $f^*:X^*\\to Y$ given by $f^*([x])=f(x)$.\n    Let $Y$ be given the identification topology and $X^*$ the quotient\n    topology (induced by $\\sim$), then $f^*$ is continuous. Indeed, for\n    if $V\\subseteq Y$ is open, then $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. But then\n    $f^{-1}(V)=\\bigcup f^{* -1}(V)$, which implies $f^{* -1}(V)$ is open\n    in $X^*$. Furthermore, the argument is reversible, so that if $U$ is\n    open in $X^*$, then so is $f^*(U)$ open in $Y$. Finally, if $f$ is\n    surjective, so is $f^*$, so that $f^*$ is a homeomorphism.",
