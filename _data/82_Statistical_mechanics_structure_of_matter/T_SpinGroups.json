In physics, the term [*spin\n\u2018groups\u2019*]{} is often used with the broad meaning of a collection of\ncoupled, or interacting spins, and thus covers the broad \u2018spectrum\u2019 of\nspin clusters ranging from gravitons (as in spin networks and spin\nfoams, for example) to \u2018up\u2019 ($u$) and \u2018down\u2019 ($d$) quark spins\n(fermions) coupled by gluons in nuclei (as treated in quantum\nchromodynamics or theoretical nuclear physics), and electron spin Cooper\npairs (regarded as bosons) in low-temperature superconductivity. On the\nother hand, in relation to *quantum symmetry*, *spin groups* are defined\nin quantum mechanics and quantum field theories (QFT) in a precise,\nmathematical (algebraic) sense as properly defined groups, as introduced\nnext. (In a semi-classical approach, the related concept of a *spinor*\nhas been introduced and studied in depth by \u00c9. Cartan, who found that\nwith his definition of spinors the (special) relativistic Lorentz\ncovariance properties were not recovered, or applicable.)\n\nIn the mathematical, precise sense of the term, a *spin group* \u2013as for\nexample the Lie group $Spin(n)$\u2013 is defined as a *double cover of the\nspecial orthogonal (Lie) group $SO(n)$* satisfying the additional\ncondition that there exists the *short exact sequence of Lie groups*:\n\n$$1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to Spin(n) \\to SO(n) \\to 1$$\n\nAlternatively one can say that the above exact sequence of Lie groups\ndefines the spin group $Spin(n)$. Furthermore, *$Spin(n)$* can also be\ndefined as the *proper subgroup (or groupoid) of the invertible elements\nin the* $\\mathbb{C}l(n)$; (when defined as a double cover this should be\n$Cl_{p, q}(R)$, a built up from an orthonormal basis of $n = p + q$\nmutually orthogonal vectors under addition and multiplication, $p$ of\nwhich have norm +1 and $q$ of which have norm $-1$, as further explained\nin the ).\n\nNote also that other spin groups such as *$Spin ~ d$* (ref. [@SW1999])\nare mathematically defined, and also important, in .\n\n[**Important examples of $Spin(n)$ and quantum symmetries: there exist\nthe following isomorphisms:**]{}\n\n1.  $Spin(1) \\cong O(1) $\n\n2.  $Spin(2) \\cong U(1)\\cong SO(2) $\n\n3.  $Spin(3) \\cong Sp(1)\\cong SU(2)$\n\n4.  $Spin(4) \\cong  Sp(1) \\times Sp(1)$\n\n5.  $Spin(5) \\cong Sp(2) $\n\n6.  $Spin(6) \\cong SU(4) $\n\nThus, the symmetry groups in the Standard Model (SUSY) of current\nPhysics can also be written as : $Spin(2) \\times Spin(3) \\times SU(3)$.\n\n[**Remarks**]{}\n\n-   In modern Physics, non-Abelian spin groups are also defined, as for\n    example, spin quantum groups and spin quantum groupoids.\n\n-   An extension of the concepts of spin group and spinor, is the notion\n    of a \u2018twistor\u2019, a mathematical concept introduced by Sir Roger\n    Penrose, generally with distinct symmetry/mathematical properties\n    from those of spin groups, such as those defined above.\n\n    The Fundamental Groups of $Spin(p,q)$\n    -------------------------------------\n\n    With the usual notation, the fundamental groups $\\pi_1(Spin(p,q))$\n    are as follows:\n\n    1.  $\\left\\{0\\right\\}$ , for $(p,q)= (1,1)$ and $(p,q)= (1,0)$;\n\n    2.  $\\left\\{0\\right\\}$ , if $p > 2$ and $q = 0,1$;\n\n    3.  $\\mathbb{Z}$ for $(p,q)= (2,0)$ and $(p,q)= (2,1)$;\n\n    4.  $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ for $(p,q)= (2,2)$;\n\n    5.  $\\mathbb{Z}$ for $ p>2, q =2 $\n\n    6.  $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ for $ p>2, q >2 $\n\n[9]{}\n\nA.
