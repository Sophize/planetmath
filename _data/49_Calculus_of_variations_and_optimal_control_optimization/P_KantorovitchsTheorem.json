  "statement": "Let ${\\mathbf{a}}_0$ be a point in $\\Bbb{R}^n, U$ an open neighborhood\nof ${\\mathbf{a}}_0$ in $\\Bbb{R}^n$ and\n${\\mathbf{f}}\\colon U\\rightarrow\\Bbb{R}^n$ a differentiable mapping,\nwith its derivative ${[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a}}_0)]}$\ninvertible. Define\n$${\\mathbf{h}}_0=-{[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a}}_0)]}^{-1}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a}}_0)\\: ,\\: {\\mathbf{a}}_1={\\mathbf{a}}_0 + {\\mathbf{h}}_0\\: ,\\: U_0 = \\{{\\mathbf{x}}|\\: |{\\mathbf{x}}-{\\mathbf{a}}_1|\\leq |{\\mathbf{h}}_0|\\}.$$\nIf $U_0\\subset U$ and the derivative\n${[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{x}})]}$ satisfies the\n$$|{[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{u}}_1)]} - {[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{u}}_2)]}|\\leq M|{\\mathbf{u}}_1-{\\mathbf{u}}_2|$$\nfor all points ${\\mathbf{u}}_1,{\\mathbf{u}}_2\\in U_0$, and if the\ninequality\n$$\\left|{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})\\right|\\left|{[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})]}^{-1}\\right|^2M\\leq\\frac{1}{2}$$\nis satisfied, the equation ${\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{x}})={\\mathbf{0}}$ has\na unique solution in $U_0$, and Newton\u2019s method with initial guess\n${\\mathbf{a}}_0$ converges to it. If we replace $\\leq$ with $<$, then it\ncan be shown that Newton\u2019s method ! If you want an even stronger\nversion, one can replace $|...|$ with the norm $||...||$.\n\nLogic behind the theorem: {#logic-behind-the-theorem .unnumbered}\n-------------------------\n\nLet\u2019s look at the useful part of the theorem:\n$$\\left|{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})\\right|\\left|{[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})]}^{-1}\\right|^2M\\leq\\frac{1}{2}.$$\nIt is a product of three distinct properties of your function such that\nthe product is less than or equal to a certain number, or bound. If we\ncall the product $R$, then it says that ${\\mathbf{a}}_0$ must be within\na ball of radius $R$. It also says that the solution ${\\mathbf{x}}$ is\nwithin this same ball. How was this ball defined?\n\nThe first term, $|{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})|$, is a measure of how\nfar the function is from the domain; in the Cartesian plane, it would be\nhow far the function is from the x-axis. Of course, if we\u2019re solving for\n${\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{x}})={\\mathbf{0}}$, we want this value to be\nsmall, because it means we\u2019re closer to the axis. However a function can\nbe annoyingly close to the axis, and yet just happily curve away from\nthe axis. Thus we need more.\n\nThe second term, $|{[\\mathbf{D}{\\mathbf{f}}({\\mathbf{a_0}})]}^{-1}|^2$\nis a little more difficult. This is obviously a measure of how fast the\nfunction is changing with respect to the domain (x-axis in the plane).\nThe larger the derivative, the faster it\u2019s approaching wherever it\u2019s\ngoing (hopefully the axis). Thus, we take the inverse of it, since we\nwant this product to be *less than* a number. Why it\u2019s squared though,\nis because it is the denominator where a product of two terms of like\nunits is the numerator. Thus to conserve units with the numerator, it is\nmultiplied by itself. Combined with the first term, this also seems to\nbe enough, but what if the derivative changes sharply, but it changes\nthe wrong way?\n\nThe third term is the Lipschitz ratio $M$. This measures sharp changes\nin the first derivative, so we can be sure that if this is small, that\nthe function won\u2019t try to curve away from our goal on us too sharply.\n\nBy the way, the number $\\frac{1}{2}$ is unitless, so all the units on\nthe left side cancel. Checking units is essential in applications, such\nas physics and engineering, where Newton\u2019s method is used.",
