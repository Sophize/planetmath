  "definition": "Let us denote with ${\\mathcal H}^m$ the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff\nmeasure in ${\\mathbb R}^n$.\n\nA set $S\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ is said to be *countably $m$-rectifiable*\nif there exists a countable sequence of Lipschitz continuous functions\n$f_k\\colon{\\mathbb R}^m \\to {\\mathbb R}^n$ such that\n$$S\\subset \\bigcup_k f_k({\\mathbb R}^m).$$\n\nA set $S\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ is said to be *countably\n$({\\mathcal H}^m,m)$-rectifiable* if there exists a set $S'$ which is\ncountable $m$-rectifiable and such that\n${\\mathcal H}^m(S\\setminus S')=0$.\n\nA set $S\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ is said to be\n*$({\\mathcal H}^m,m)$-rectifiable* or simply *$m$-rectifiable* if it is\n$({\\mathcal H}^m,m)$-rectifiable and ${\\mathcal H}^m(S)<+\\infty$.\n\nIf $S$ is any Borel subset of ${\\mathbb R}^n$ and $x\\in {\\mathbb R}^n$\nis given, one can define the *density* of $S$ in $x$ as\n$$\\Theta^m(S,x) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 0} \\frac{{\\mathcal H}^m(S\\cap B_\\rho(x))}\n{\\omega_m \\rho^m}$$ where $\\omega_m$ is the Lebesgue measure of the unit\nball in ${\\mathbb R}^m$. Notice that an $m$-dimensional plane $\\Pi$ has\ndensity $1$ in all points $x\\in\\Pi$ and density $0$ in all points\n$x\\not\\in\\Pi$.\n\nIt turns out that if $S$ is rectifiable, then in\n${\\mathcal H}^m$-a.e.\u00a0point $x\\in S$ the density $\\Theta^m(S,x)$ exists\nand is equal to $1$. Moreover in ${\\mathcal H}^m$-a.e.\u00a0point $x\\in S$\nthere exists an *approximate tangent plane* to $S$ as defined below.\n\nGiven a point $x\\in S\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ and a vector\n$v\\in {\\mathbb R}^n$ we say that $v$ is tangent to $S$ in $x$ if there\nexists a sequence of points $x_k\\in S$, $x_k\\to x$ and a sequence of\npositive numbers $\\lambda_k$ such that\n$$\\lim_{k\\to \\infty} \\lambda_k (x_k -x) = v.$$ If $S$ is an\n$m$-dimensional manifold, then the set of tangent vectors to a point\n$x\\in S$ is nothing else than the usual tangent plane to $S$ in $x$.\n\nWe say that a vector $v$ is *approximately tangent* to $S$ in $x$ if it\nis a tangent vector to every subset $S'$ of $S$ such that\n$\\Theta^m(S\\setminus S',x)=0$. Notice that every tangent vector is also\nan approximately tangent vector while the converse is not always true,\nas it is shown in an example below. The point, here, is that being the\nset $S$ defined ${\\mathcal H}^m$-almost everywhere, we need a stronger\ndefinition for tangent vectors.\n\nThe *approximate tangent cone* to $S$ in $x$ is the set of all\napproximately tangent vectors to $S$ in $x$ (notice that if $v$ is a\ntangent vector then $\\lambda v$ is also a tangent vector, for all\n$\\lambda>0$). If the approximate tangent cone is an $m$-dimensional\nvector subspace of ${\\mathbb R}^n$, it is called the *approximate\ntangent plane*.\n\nNotice that if $S\\subset {\\mathbb R}^n$ is any $m$-dimensional regular\nsurface, and $Q$ is the set of all points of ${\\mathbb R}^n$ with\nrational coordinates, then the set $S\\cup Q$ is an $m$-rectifiable set\nsince ${\\mathcal H}^1(Q)=0$. Notice, however, that\n$\\overline{S\\cup Q} = {\\mathbb R}^n$ and consequently every vector $v$\nis tangent to $S\\cup Q$ in every point $x\\in S\\cup Q$. On the other hand\nthe approximately tangent vectors to $S\\cup Q$ are only the tangent\nvectors to $S$, because the set $Q$ has density $0$ everywhere.\n\n[9]{} Frank Morgan: *Geometric Measure Theory: A Beginner\u2019s Guide*.",
