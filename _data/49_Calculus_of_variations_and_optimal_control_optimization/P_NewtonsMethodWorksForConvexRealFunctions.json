Then the following sequence $\\{ x_n \\}$ obtained from Newton\u2019s\nmethod, $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\\,,$$ will converge to a\nroot of $f$, provided that $f'(x_0) \\neq 0$ and $x_1 \\in I$ for the\ngiven starting point $x_0 \\in I$.\n\nObviously, \u201cconvex\u201d can be replaced by \u201cconcave\u201d in Theorem\n\\[thm:main\\].\n\nThe proof will proceed in several steps. First, a simple converse\nresult:\n\n\\[thm:converse\\] Let $f\\colon I \\to {\\mathbb{R}}$ be a differentiable\nconvex function, and $\\{x_n\\}$ be the sequence in Theorem \\[thm:main\\].\nIf it is convergent to a number $a \\in I$, then $a$ is necessarily a\nroot of $f$.\n\nWe have $$0 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f'(x_n) \\cdot (x_n - x_{n+1}) = \n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(x_n) = f(a)\\,.$$ (The first limit is zero by local\nboundedness of $f'$ at $a$, which follows from $f'$ being finite and\nmonotone[^1].)\n\nProof of Theorem \\[thm:main\\] {#proof-of-theorem-thmmain .unnumbered}\n=============================\n\nCase A: when $I = {\\mathbb{R}}$, $f' > 0$, and $f(x_0) \\geq 0$ {#case-a-when-i-mathbbr-f-0-and-fx_0-geq-0 .unnumbered}\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe claim that whenever $f(x_n) \\geq 0$, then $f(x_{n+1}) \\geq 0$ too.\nRecall that the graph of a convex function $f$ always lies above any of\nits tangent lines. So in particular, the point $(x_{n+1}, f(x_{n+1}))$\nis higher than the point $(x_{n+1}, 0)$, which is on the tangent line by\ndefinition. By induction, we have $f(x_n) \\geq 0$ for all $n$.\n\nWe also have $x_{n+1} \\leq x_n$ for all $n$. By hypothesis the slope\n$f'(x_n)$ of the tangent line is positive, and $(x_n, f(x_n))$ lies\nabove the horizontal axis. Then the intersection point of the tangent\nline and the horizontal axis, which is $(x_{n+1}, 0)$, must be to the\nleft of $(x_n, 0)$.\n\nSo the sequence $\\{ x_n \\}$ is decreasing. It converges to a real number\nor diverges to $-\\infty$. If the limit is a real number, by Theorem\n\\[thm:converse\\] that number is a root of $f$, and we are done.\n\nIf the limit is $-\\infty$, then we must have $f(x_n) > 0$ for all $x_n$.\nHence $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$, as $f$ is monotone and $x_n$ can be\narbitrarily large negative. In other words, $f$ has no root to begin\nwith.\n\n![Case A: $\\{ x_n \\}$ is monotonically decreasing](convex-newton.1.eps)\n\nCase B: when $I = {\\mathbb{R}}$, $f' < 0$, and $f(x_0) \\geq 0$ {#case-b-when-i-mathbbr-f-0-and-fx_0-geq-0 .unnumbered}\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis situation is the (left-right) mirror of Case A, except that because\nthe slope of the curve is negative, the sequence $\\{ x_n \\}$ is\nincreasing this time. We still have $x_n \\geq 0$, so the sequence either\nconverges to a root of $f$, or diverges to $+\\infty$ (in which case $f$\nhas no root).\n\n![Case B: $\\{ x_n \\}$ is monotonically increasing](convex-newton.2.eps)\n\nCase C: when $I = {\\mathbb{R}}$, $f'(x_0) > 0$, and $f(x_0) \\geq 0$ {#case-c-when-i-mathbbr-fx_0-0-and-fx_0-geq-0 .unnumbered}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo begin, note that the first part of Case A, asserting that\n$f(x_n) \\geq 0$ for all $n$, still goes through only assuming\n$f'(x_n) \\neq 0$ \u2014 in which case the sequence would not be defined after\nthe point $x_n$. We show that, in fact, $f'(x_n) > 0$ for all $n$, so\nthe rest of Case A goes through.\n\nSuppose $n$ is the smallest integer for which $f'(x_{n+1}) \\leq 0$. Also\nassume $f(x_n), f(x_{n+1}) \\neq 0$, otherwise we would be done anyway.\nThe reasoning in Case A shows $x_{n+1} < x_n$.\n\n![Case C: a tangent line separates $f$ from the horizontal\naxis](convex-newton.3.eps)\n\nThe function $f$ is strictly positive on $[x_{n+1}, x_n]$, for the graph\nof $f$ lies above the tangent line segment extending from $(x_{n+1}, 0)$\nto $(x_n, f(x_n))$, which in turn lies strictly above the horizontal\naxis. Since $f$ is decreasing to the left of $[x_{n+1}, x_n]$ and\nincreasing to the right, $f$ never touches the horizontal axis anywhere.\nThis contradicts our hypothesis that $f$ has roots.\n\nCase D: when $I = {\\mathbb{R}}$, $f'(x_0) < 0$, and $f(x_0) \\geq 0$ {#case-d-when-i-mathbbr-fx_0-0-and-fx_0-geq-0 .unnumbered}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis situation is the (left-right) mirror of Case C. The same argument\nshows that $f'(x_n) < 0$ for all $n$ (or $f(x_n) = 0$ for some $n$), and\nthe argument of Case B applies.\n\nCase E: for general intervals $I$ {#case-e-for-general-intervals-i .unnumbered}\n---------------------------------\n\nThe only concern is that the iteration $\\{ x_n \\}$ might go outside the\ninterval $I$. We show that it does not.\n\nSuppose $f(x_0) \\geq 0$. Then as we have proved, $f(x_n) \\geq 0$ for all\n$n$. Suppose $x_n \\in I$ but $x_{n+1} \\notin I$. Then $f$ has no root,\nbecause the graph of $f$ lies above the tangent line from\n$(x_n, f(x_n))$ to $(x_{n+1}, 0)$ which lies above the horizontal axis.\n\nThe *limit* of $x_n$ could conceivably go just outside the interval $I$.\nBut this case is similar to the case $x_n \\to \\pm \\infty$ already\nconsidered in Case A: $f$ possesses no root then.\n\nFinally, suppose $f(x_0) < 0$, the case we have ignored all along. Our\nhypotheses assume that $f(x_1)$ is defined. We immediately have\n$f(x_1) \\geq 0$, since the graph of $f$ lies above the tangent line from\n$(x_0, f(x_0))$ to $(x_1, 0)$. But this just brings us back to the other\ncases.\n\n![Case E: $f(x_1)$ is always $\\geq 0$](convex-newton.4.eps \"fig:\")\n![Case E: $f(x_1)$ is always $\\geq 0$](convex-newton.5.eps \"fig:\")\n\nExamples {#examples .unnumbered}\n========\n\nNewton\u2019s method for finding square roots of positive numbers $\\alpha$\n(which reduces to the ancient divide-and-average method) always\nconverges, for the target function $f(x) = x^2 - \\alpha$ is convex.\n\n[3]{} Michael Spivak.
